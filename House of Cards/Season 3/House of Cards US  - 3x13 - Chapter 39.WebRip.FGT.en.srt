Owner's coming in next week.
Anybody off the books, he'll be on my ass.

4
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,958
If I switch some doubles with Benito,
is that okay?

00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:57,709
Whatever you and him wanna work out.

Welcome to Caracas.
The time is 3:21--

8
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:00,373
We've been lying for a long time, Francis.

9
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:01,499
Of course we have.

10
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,920
Imagine what the voters would think
if we started telling the truth.

11
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:07,214
Not to them.

12
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,007
To each other.

13
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:11,843
What do you mean?

14
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,471
You know what? Never mind.

15
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,390
No. How have we been lying to each other?

16
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:18,934
- We're not.
- You just said that.

17
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,731
We've begun
our final descent into Des Moines.

18
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:27,442
Please find a seat
and put your seat belts on.

19
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,994
Should we talk?

20
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:39,746
No. I shouldn't have said anything.

21
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:54,112
Where is she?

22
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,332
Tell me where she is.

23
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,917
I don't know, man.

24
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,544
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

25
00:06:11,546 --> 00:06:14,883
Ah! Oh! God!

26
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,512
I'm not asking again.

27
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:29,356
- My computer.
- I tried that.

28
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,900
- It's locked.
- I'll give you the code.

29
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:05,016
- You don't have anything more?
- That's all I have.

30
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,602
- How current is this?
- She's there, I promise.

31
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,584
I found you once.
I can find you again.

32
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,837
If this information is wrong, you die.

33
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:38,633
You try to contact her, you die.

34
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:21,217
Frank Underwood
is a dangerous man.

35
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:25,805
Because power in the hands of those
who lack honesty,

36
00:08:25,888 --> 00:08:28,557
lacks a moral compass.

37
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:33,271
And without a moral compass,
power runs amok.

38
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,606
Heather Dunbar can question
my husband's choices.

39
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,067
She can criticize his policies.

40
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:42,071
But to cast aspersions on his character
is proof of desperation.

41
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:45,825
If he will lie about the death
of a US soldier,

42
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:49,496
what else is he lying about?

43
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:53,916
We know he already lied
about not running in 2016.

44
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,795
The people of Iowa know better.
They see the same man I see:

45
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,757
a strong, decisive leader
who doesn't always do what's popular,

46
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,468
but he always does what's right.

47
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:08,390
The decision you make next Tuesday
is one you'll live with for years.

48
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,726
For three decades,
I've stood by my husband's side.

49
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:14,979
Because I know he stands up
for people like you.

50
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:18,107
You have the power to choose.

51
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,817
Choose progress over pettiness.

52
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:23,279
You have the power, not him.

53
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,115
Choose a president over a charlatan.

54
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,161
Ladies and gentlemen, my husband,
President Frank Underwood.

55
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:43,174
Thank you!
Thank you very much.

56
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,676
I'm gonna give you one good reason

57
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,722
why Heather Dunbar
doesn't stand a chance on Tuesday.

58
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:53,017
She doesn't have Claire Underwood
standing by her side.

59
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:59,482
I want to spend a few minutes
talking about the future

60
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,318
that we are going to build together.

61
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:05,405
And I say together,
because I can't do it alone.

62
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:06,864
I need your help.

63
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:22,547
Meet me out back.

64
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:38,729
- You have it?
- Yeah. How about you?

65
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:40,689
Cassie Lockhart.

66
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,942
Social Security card,
driver's license, birth certificate.

67
00:10:43,025 --> 00:10:44,402
It's all legit.

68
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:56,247
Why "Cassie"?
It's not even a real first name.

69
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:58,707
I mean, if it were short
for something, like Cassandra.

70
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,377
- But as your legal name?
- It's all there.

71
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:12,639
Hey, Cassie,
take a hundred back if you want it.

72
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:14,723
My truck's right there.

73
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,226
You keep it.

74
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,062
Come on. I gave you a big discount.
Show some gratitude.

75
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:22,440
Go home to your wife... and kids.

76
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,637
I want you to fuck me, Francis.

77
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,603
- I'm working.
- Shut up.

78
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,861
What is going on?

79
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,493
I want you to be rough with me.

80
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:19,581
- Take me.
- Claire.

81
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:23,834
- Now, listen.
- Do it. Now!

82
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:25,420
Is this what you want?

83
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,504
- You want this?
- Yes.

84
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:28,464
- Yes.
- You want it rough?

85
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,262
I want you to look at me.

86
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:35,888
Look at me while you do it.

87
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:48,109
That's what I thought.

88
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:17,597
Yes, I'd like to arrange a room
for the First Lady, please.

89
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,433
Yes, right away.

90
00:13:36,324 --> 00:13:39,076
I think you should go back
to Washington in the morning.

91
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:53,966
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I did a double at the store last night.

92
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,678
- No worries.
- I'll work quick.

93
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,777
About 200,000 miles.

94
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,780
It's not much to look at, but...
it runs well.

95
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,871
- How much?
- Twelve hundred.

96
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:29,335
But I don't got a title, so technically,
you're just buying it for parts.

97
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:31,170
Have gas in the tank?

98
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:34,298
Yeah, you can drive her right out.

99
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:37,385
- You'll need plates, though.
- I got plates.

100
00:14:39,053 --> 00:14:41,055
- Cash okay?
- It's all we take.

101
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,018
Underwood! Underwood! Underwood!

102
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:30,396
Underwood! Underwood!

103
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:45,035
Yes, I'm good.

104
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:47,121
Ladies and gentlemen,

105
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:51,333
the President of the United States,
Frank Underwood!

106
00:16:00,217 --> 00:16:02,887
Thank you!
Thank you very much.

107
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,265
It's good to be back in Iowa City!

108
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,811
Claire couldn't be here today,
but she wants you to know

109
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:12,730
she's a big Hawkeyes fan.

110
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:22,156
Now here, at one of the country's
finest public universities,

111
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:26,661
I wanna talk to you about
Heather Dunbar's preference for--

112
00:17:27,972 --> 00:17:30,975
- Hey, can you do another double tomorrow?
- Yeah, no problem.

113
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:33,310
- All right, have a good night.
- You, too.

114
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:08,136
Hi, I'm Cassie Lockhart.

115
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:12,975
Hello. Cassie. Hey.

116
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:17,563
Cassie. C-A-double-S-I-E.

117
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:21,067
Lockhart.
L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T.

118
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:24,486
April 21st-- Just a second!

119
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:42,838
Hey. I've got rent money for you--

120
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,715
No, no, no, no.
I have good news.

121
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,717
Bianca got her protected status.

122
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,473
Oh, my God! That's so great!

123
00:18:55,977 --> 00:18:57,895
She says thank you
for all your help with her paperwork.

124
00:18:57,979 --> 00:18:59,647
- Of course.
- We're celebrating.

125
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,482
Maria got a bottle
from her Thursday house.

126
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:03,025
They gave it to me for the holidays.

127
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,110
This is nice.

128
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:08,823
I know, it's really terrible.

129
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:18,248
She has family in Houston.

130
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,375
They're gonna help her get
into community college.

131
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,252
I'm so happy for her.

132
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:25,756
What about you, eh?
You're not staying here forever.

133
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,804
Once I save up enough,
I want to get my own car.

134
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:33,597
And have enough for my own place.

135
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:35,557
Here in Santa?

136
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:39,227
Up north, I think.
In the woods somewhere.

137
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,855
I miss the trees and the rain.

138
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:43,107
Someplace quiet.

139
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:46,735
Something new.

140
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,488
Yeah.

141
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:51,532
Well, you're a smart girl, Lisa.

142
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:53,742
I'm sure you're gonna
get everything you want.

143
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,911
If Bianca can do it, you can.

144
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:02,209
To Bianca! And her new life.

145
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,419
- Salud!
- Salud!

146
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,278
Sir?

147
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,198
Do you think she can join us tomorrow?

148
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,534
- The press are starting to ask.
- If we win, it'll be strange

149
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:37,912
if she isn't standing next to you
for your victory speech.

150
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:40,831
Even stranger if you have
to make a concession speech.

151
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,960
If I have to make a concession speech,

152
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,463
the absence of the First Lady
will be the least of our problems.

153
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm going for a run.
Can you arrange the detail, please?

154
00:20:59,183 --> 00:21:02,269
- Ma'am, if you run in public, it might...
- Might what?

155
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:04,813
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'll take care of it right away.

156
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,775
No, if it's a problem
with me running, tell me.

157
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:11,528
It might highlight the fact
that you're not in Iowa.

158
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:33,134
Right there, please.

159
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:33,337
Quiet. Hey, hey!

160
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,305
Help! No!

161
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:51,980
You want me to put you out again?

162
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,440
Huh?

163
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:57,278
Open your mouth. Open it.

164
00:23:57,361 --> 00:23:58,779
I won't make any noise.

165
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:10,082
You make one sound, or you move an inch...

166
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:16,088
- What?
- I won't.

167
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,048
I won't scream or anything.

168
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,066
Nataly puts the ball on the 44 ya--

169
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,110
Jesus is knocking on--

170
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:42,030
Less than 24 hours to go
before the Iowa caucuses,

171
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:46,243
the Republicans have a broad field
with no clear front-runner.

172
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:50,164
For the Democrats, President Underwood
has gained momentum in the polls.

173
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:53,334
A rise that many political experts
are attributing

174
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:56,337
to the recent appearance
of Claire Underwood in the--

175
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,131
Every major poll has it as a dead heat,

176
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,549
with both candidates hovering
at 45 percent.

177
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,803
That still leaves one in ten
likely caucus-goers

178
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:07,513
who won't be making their decision
until tomorrow evening.

179
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:09,933
Mrs. Underwood,
the president is on the phone for you.

180
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:13,354
President Underwood spent the last full
day of campaigning traversing the state,

181
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:15,981
completing his tour
of all 99 Iowa counties.

182
00:25:16,064 --> 00:25:17,774
- Hello?
- Listen.

183
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:22,528
No matter what happens tomorrow night,
I want you by my side.

184
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,698
Are you open to that?

185
00:25:27,242 --> 00:25:28,452
Claire?

186
00:25:29,577 --> 00:25:30,745
I'll fly out in the morning.

187
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,664
No, no. You can come in the afternoon.

188
00:25:32,747 --> 00:25:35,583
You don't have to do any
events or press, just...

189
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:38,337
be there with me when I make my speech.

190
00:25:39,254 --> 00:25:41,923
- I said yes.
- Thank you.

191
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,300
Of course.

192
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:46,345
Last night...

193
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:50,640
Let's not. I'll see you tomorrow.

194
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,644
- All right. Good night.
- Good night.

195
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,706
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

196
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,127
I wish I could take it back.

197
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,586
I told you to be quiet.

198
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:27,886
I thought I killed you.

199
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,434
When I heard on the news you were alive,
I felt so relieved.

200
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:35,852
- I doubt that.
- I mean it.

201
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:43,360
I would pray for you.

202
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:45,946
Probably sounds strange, but it's true.

203
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:49,533
I would, because I felt so bad.
You didn't deserve what I did.

204
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:52,119
None of this is going to change anything.

205
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,919
Where are we going?

206
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,171
Doesn't matter.

207
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:07,675
Is it gonna be a while?
'Cause I have to pee.

208
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:13,014
You can pee back there.

209
00:27:15,517 --> 00:27:17,102
You don't want that. The smell.

210
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:19,187
It's either that or you hold it.

211
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,607
- It hurts.
- Too bad.

212
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:25,068
All right then, I'm gonna do it.

213
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,228
Mrs. Underwood.

214
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:03,106
Please, come sit.

215
00:28:14,117 --> 00:28:15,619
Thank you for coming.

216
00:28:15,701 --> 00:28:19,873
I'm sorry for how everything
has worked out. It's unfortunate.

217
00:28:19,956 --> 00:28:23,251
I'm sure it's been difficult for you,
with all of the effort you put in.

218
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:25,379
Is this how it works?

219
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:27,713
He nixes the book, you soften the blow?

220
00:28:27,797 --> 00:28:29,132
No, Tom, it's not that.

221
00:28:29,216 --> 00:28:31,176
Francis doesn't even know
I asked you here.

222
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:33,220
Why did you ask me?

223
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:39,893
Because I was wondering if...
we could talk honestly to each other.

224
00:28:39,976 --> 00:28:41,186
If you'd be open to that.

225
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:44,648
- About what?
- New Hampshire.

226
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,526
Did you let me pass out that day
on purpose?

227
00:28:47,609 --> 00:28:48,943
When I was giving blood.

228
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,905
I let you keep talking.
I didn't know you'd pass out.

229
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:53,240
And you didn't see it coming?

230
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:55,659
You had things you wanted to say.

231
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:02,583
And what did I say...
before I blacked out?

232
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:05,544
Was there anything else
other than what you wrote?

233
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:07,713
You don't remember?

234
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,049
Some. But not all of it.

235
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:17,347
I'm asking for me.
Because I need to know.

236
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:21,976
Hatred.

237
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,689
For how much you and Frank
needed each other.

238
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,816
I used that word? Hate?

239
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,486
You did.

240
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:36,324
And of all the moments...

241
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:39,077
that you spent
with Francis and myself, you...

242
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,330
You believe that we're equals?

243
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:46,042
I got fired, Mrs. Underwood.
I'm not on the clock anymore.

244
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:50,004
There's a lot more to Francis and me
than what you wrote.

245
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,925
Maybe so,
but I never got a chance to ask.

246
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,219
Then ask. Whatever you want.

247
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:02,350
Why aren't you with him? In Iowa?

248
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,483
- I'm heading there tomorrow.
- Hm...

249
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:10,609
You see?

250
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:14,446
I ask a question,
and neither of you answer them.

251
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:21,244
It's tiresome, constantly swinging
a sledgehammer at the façade,

252
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:23,789
just to get a glimpse through the cracks.

253
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:28,794
Tell me what you see.

254
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:33,548
Somebody who's lost.

255
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,178
But I don't know.

256
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:40,388
Maybe it's all for the best.

257
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:45,686
I'd rather imagine who you might be
than who you actually are.

258
00:30:55,362 --> 00:30:57,238
Good luck, Claire.

That's enough.

269
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:03,263
- It calms me.
- Then sing it in your head.

270
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:28,079
You're gonna be able
to live with yourself?

271
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:32,208
What's the point?

272
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:34,711
I can't hurt you.

273
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:36,755
No one's ever gonna find me
or know who I am.

274
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:38,172
I'm never gonna say anything.

275
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,633
Quiet.

276
00:32:41,885 --> 00:32:44,345
If it's about punishing me,
you don't have to.

277
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:49,726
This last year, some of the things I've
had to do, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

278
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,770
I said quiet.

279
00:33:57,627 --> 00:33:59,420
What did the overnight internals say?

280
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,756
Still a toss-up.
Less than half a point gap.

281
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,508
- Her or me?
- Doesn't matter.

282
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:05,927
The margin of error is four-point-five.

283
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,847
The last few days, the lead's
gone back and forth three times.

284
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,390
Bottom line is turnout.

285
00:34:10,473 --> 00:34:12,517
- Sir?
- Yes, I'm almost ready.

286
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,143
May I speak to you
for a moment privately?

287
00:34:14,227 --> 00:34:17,104
- Yes. Thank you.
- I'll be right outside.

288
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:20,984
I just got word that Mrs. Underwood
has postponed her flight here.

289
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:23,110
- What? Why?
- I don't know, sir.

290
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:26,239
Also, Agent Swift,
the head of her detail...

291
00:34:26,322 --> 00:34:29,158
he said Tom Yates
came to the residence last night.

292
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,579
Tell Vaughn I'll be down in a few minutes.

293
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:34,372
Yes, sir.

294
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:36,833
This is Claire.
Please leave a message.

295
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,383
This is Claire.
Please leave a message.

296
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:48,553
It's me. When you get this message,
will you please call me?

297
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:40,563
Listen, if you breathe deeply,

298
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:42,189
you're gonna pass out right away.

299
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,733
- Please.
- Then nothing's gonna hurt.

300
00:35:43,817 --> 00:35:45,860
Doug, please. Please.

301
00:35:47,194 --> 00:35:48,237
Help!

302
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:50,740
No one can hear you.
Lie down, Rachel.

303
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:53,534
Look, Rachel's gone!

304
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:01,709
That is who I am now.

305
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,089
Look, I know you
don't want to do this.

306
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:08,091
You-- You could--

307
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:10,426
You could've done it
in the parking lot last night,

308
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,846
but you didn't, you kept me alive!

309
00:36:15,264 --> 00:36:17,433
I know this isn't who you are.

310
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,103
Please.

311
00:36:20,186 --> 00:36:22,647
Please. Please. Please, just let me go.

312
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,565
Please.

313
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,234
Doug.

314
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,737
Doug, please. Please.
Please just let me go.

315
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:31,781
- Please! Doug! Please!
- Fuck!

316
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:04,856
The president is
on the line for you again.

317
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:06,900
You told him I'm not feeling well?

318
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:10,862
Yes, ma'am.
He'd still like to speak with you.

319
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:12,572
Tell him I'm sleeping.

320
00:37:16,826 --> 00:37:18,619
I'm sleeping. Please tell him.

321
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,205
Yes, ma'am.

322
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:07,961
Here.

323
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,113
I don't know why
you had to run that night.

324
00:38:37,073 --> 00:38:39,617
All I ever tried to do was keep you safe.

325
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,620
I was afraid.
I wasn't thinking.

326
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,582
I'm sorry.

327
00:38:46,666 --> 00:38:48,751
I know you have a good heart.

328
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:53,006
You're saying that
because you want me to let you go.

329
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:55,300
Look at me.

330
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:58,427
Look at me, Doug.

331
00:39:01,388 --> 00:39:04,017
You don't have to kill Rachel.

332
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,268
She's already dead.

333
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:08,604
She died in those woods,
and it's better that way.

334
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:11,274
She didn't have a very good life.

335
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:15,778
But... But if you do this, you're not
killing Rachel, you're killing Cassie.

336
00:39:15,862 --> 00:39:17,738
And...

337
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,909
all Cassie Lockhart wants to be
is someplace far away.

338
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,207
Someplace where nobody'll ever find her.

339
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,005
She likes to go to the movie theater.

340
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:38,467
It doesn't matter what's showing, just...
she likes the smell of the popcorn.

341
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:40,094
She wants a dog.

342
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,264
A black lab.

343
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:47,393
And a queen-size bed.

344
00:39:49,062 --> 00:39:52,232
Lots of blankets to curl up in.
She doesn't want much.

345
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:56,694
She just wants to be invisible.

346
00:40:02,742 --> 00:40:04,451
Hey.

347
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,622
Hey, look at me.

348
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,837
My name is Cassie Lockhart.

349
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:16,857
Give me your ankles.

350
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,615
Give me your hands.

351
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:39,755
Come on.

352
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:42,675
Let's go.

353
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:49,849
Some water.

354
00:41:58,191 --> 00:42:00,318
There's a town 20 miles that way.

355
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,916
First off, I'd like to congratulate
President Underwood

356
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,085
for his victory here tonight.

357
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:26,713
It was a tight race
and he came out on top.

358
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,675
- Boo!
- No. No, no, no, no!

359
00:44:29,758 --> 00:44:32,178
Let's not be sore losers here.

360
00:44:32,261 --> 00:44:35,640
Because the truth is, we haven't lost.

361
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:39,226
We are just getting started!

362
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:48,693
I want to thank all the staff
and volunteers

363
00:44:48,777 --> 00:44:52,198
who worked so hard
over the past several months.

364
00:44:52,281 --> 00:44:53,449
We should get going.

365
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:56,202
I want to try Claire one more time.
See if she'll come out.

366
00:44:56,285 --> 00:44:59,497
That's three hours from now,
even if she left this minute.

367
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,290
But the crowd will wait.

368
00:45:01,374 --> 00:45:02,958
We don't want to squander primetime.

369
00:45:03,042 --> 00:45:07,004
A speech at one in the morning,
we lose major viewership.

370
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:10,383
My children and my dear husband...

371
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:12,677
Fine. Let's go.

372
00:45:12,759 --> 00:45:15,012
How do you want to handle the stage
if she's not on it?

373
00:45:15,095 --> 00:45:16,972
I won't need a stage.

374
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:36,992
Thank you for coming out.

375
00:45:37,076 --> 00:45:38,827
Thank you very much. Thank you.

376
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:44,291
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

377
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:58,097
Well, Iowa has spoken.

378
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:05,396
And they have spoken so loud,
that I don't even need a microphone.

379
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:11,694
Listen, I wanted to come down here to our
campaign headquarters in Des Moines,

380
00:46:11,776 --> 00:46:16,741
not go to some fancy hotel ballroom
like you know who,

381
00:46:16,823 --> 00:46:20,578
and say to all of you
who worked day in and day out,

382
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:24,749
on our behalf for this campaign,
in every corner of this state...

383
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:27,918
It's because of you
that we brought it home tonight!

384
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:36,093
Now, I know you're all wondering
where Claire is.

385
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:38,721
Some of you may know
she's been a little under the weather.

386
00:46:38,803 --> 00:46:39,888
She's from Texas.

387
00:46:39,972 --> 00:46:42,891
She doesn't understand
these Iowa winters you have.

388
00:46:44,143 --> 00:46:47,020
But she's on the mend and
I'm flying to Washington tonight,

389
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,565
so that tomorrow she and I
can get on a plane

390
00:46:49,649 --> 00:46:53,611
and fly to New Hampshire,
where we are gonna win there, too!

391
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,296
Claire.

392
00:47:18,843 --> 00:47:20,680
They told me you were down here.

393
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,518
I just wanted to come somewhere to think.

394
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:29,146
Well, I hope you have.

395
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,234
And that whatever
was clouding your mind is gone.

396
00:47:35,778 --> 00:47:39,740
Because I just had to give
a victory speech... alone.

397
00:47:41,908 --> 00:47:47,080
And one way or another,
I need you on that plane with me tomorrow.

398
00:47:52,044 --> 00:47:54,714
No. The desk.

399
00:47:54,797 --> 00:47:56,590
Left-hand drawer.

400
00:48:07,142 --> 00:48:08,185
You still have this.

401
00:48:10,145 --> 00:48:11,647
Yes.

402
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:14,650
It felt wrong to throw it out,
for some reason.

403
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:29,206
When I said we were lying,
what I meant was...

404
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:36,963
For all these years,
I thought we were on this path together.

405
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,675
But it's not what I thought it would be.

406
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:44,722
What I convinced myself it would be,
like what Thomas wrote.

407
00:48:44,805 --> 00:48:48,726
- We're two equal parts.
- We are.

408
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:50,603
You really believe that?

409
00:48:51,771 --> 00:48:53,814
We earned this together.

410
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:58,360
I said that to your face the first day
I walked in here as president.

411
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:01,113
It's your office. Not mine.

412
00:49:01,196 --> 00:49:06,702
I have not made a single major decision
without asking your opinion first.

413
00:49:06,786 --> 00:49:11,540
But see, that's it.
You make the decisions.

414
00:49:11,624 --> 00:49:14,126
Anything that I want, like the UN...

415
00:49:15,544 --> 00:49:18,171
It made me ill, Francis.
My stomach turned.

416
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,548
Why, because you had to resign?

417
00:49:19,632 --> 00:49:22,175
No, because I had to ask
for your help in the first place.

418
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,220
That I couldn't get the confirmation
on my own.

419
00:49:25,304 --> 00:49:28,098
And what is wrong with asking
for my help when you need it?

420
00:49:28,181 --> 00:49:30,183
The fact that I need it.

421
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,646
I hate that feeling. It's not me.

422
00:49:33,729 --> 00:49:35,689
I don't recognize myself
when I look in the mirror.

423
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:39,359
I do things...
like I did in the hotel in Iowa.

424
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:42,822
I can't even talk with you about it.

425
00:49:42,905 --> 00:49:45,282
Instead you want me
to slap you around like some animal.

426
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:47,785
That's what we are
when we strip everything away.

427
00:49:47,868 --> 00:49:50,454
- That I can understand!
- It was deranged,

428
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:52,289
begging me to take you like that.

429
00:49:52,372 --> 00:49:55,167
And you couldn't even give that to me.

430
00:49:56,084 --> 00:49:59,839
If you wanted a husband who proved
his manhood to you that way,

431
00:49:59,922 --> 00:50:02,842
you should've stayed back
in Dallas with your mother

432
00:50:02,925 --> 00:50:04,551
and married the prom king.

433
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,178
At least I would've known
where I stood.

434
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:08,806
No, you can't have it both ways.

435
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:11,433
You want an equal partner
when it suits you?

436
00:50:11,517 --> 00:50:14,269
You want a man to take charge
when it suits you?

437
00:50:14,353 --> 00:50:18,148
And I'm supposed to what,
just divine when you want which?

438
00:50:18,231 --> 00:50:20,776
Stop being so selfish.
You're better than that.

439
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,820
- I'm not being selfish.
- You are.

440
00:50:22,903 --> 00:50:25,572
We're in the middle of an election,
and look at us.

441
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:28,158
That's exactly it.
Look at us, Francis.

442
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:29,785
We used to make each other stronger.

443
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:31,912
At least I thought so, but that was a lie.

444
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:34,665
We were making you stronger.

445
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:39,837
And now I'm just weak and small,
and I can't stand that feeling any longer.

446
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,882
All right. What do you want?

447
00:50:42,965 --> 00:50:45,467
What is the goddamn alternative?

448
00:50:45,551 --> 00:50:48,679
Please, Claire, tell me,
because I don't understand.

449
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:52,766
All I am hearing is, it's not enough.

450
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,101
That the White House is not enough.

451
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,062
That being First Lady is not enough.

452
00:50:58,146 --> 00:51:00,315
- Not enough!
- No.

453
00:51:00,399 --> 00:51:01,692
It's you that's not enough.

454
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,605
When we lose... because of you...

455
00:51:40,773 --> 00:51:43,817
there will be nothing.

456
00:51:43,901 --> 00:51:47,071
No plan. No future.

457
00:51:48,948 --> 00:51:51,825
We will only be has-beens.

458
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,122
And you want to amount to something?

459
00:51:58,206 --> 00:52:02,210
Well, here is the brutal fucking truth.

460
00:52:02,294 --> 00:52:07,800
And you can hate me, you can be disgusted,
you can feel whatever it is you wanna feel

461
00:52:07,883 --> 00:52:10,761
because frankly, I'm beyond caring.

462
00:52:10,844 --> 00:52:15,307
But without me,
you are nothing.

463
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:20,144
You're right. This office has one chair.

464
00:52:20,228 --> 00:52:25,692
And you have always known that
from the very beginning.

465
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:29,947
And if you now can't stomach that,

466
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:34,409
well, then I'm a fool for having
married you in the first place.

467
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:37,537
But I don't have time to be a fool.

468
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:41,458
I have to run this country
and win a nomination.

469
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:44,044
I'm doing my job.

470
00:52:44,128 --> 00:52:47,714
Doug is out there doing his job.

471
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:53,595
And it's time now for you to do yours.

472
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,809
You want me to take charge?
Fine. I will take charge.

473
00:52:58,892 --> 00:53:03,522
You will get on that plane tomorrow.
You will come to New Hampshire.

474
00:53:03,605 --> 00:53:07,693
You will smile and shake hands
and kiss babies.

475
00:53:07,776 --> 00:53:10,696
And you will stand with me on a stage.

476
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:15,034
And you will be the First Lady!

477
00:53:15,117 --> 00:53:17,410
And you do all that.

478
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:21,414
I don't give a damn if you vomit
on your own time.

479
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:52,320
You're scheduled to depart
in 20 minutes, sir.

480
00:53:52,404 --> 00:53:55,281
Thank you. Check in with the First Lady,
make sure she's ready.

481
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,700
Yes, sir.

482
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:06,126
So?

483
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,505
Are you okay?

484
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:12,340
I'm good to go, sir.

485
00:54:20,306 --> 00:54:21,516
Yes?

486
00:54:23,018 --> 00:54:26,479
Ma'am, the president wanted me
to check and see if you're ready.

487
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:30,400
Ma'am?

488
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:41,203
Francis.

489
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,461
I'm not going to New Hampshire.

490
00:54:49,544 --> 00:54:51,964
Yes, you are. I'll see you in the car.

491
00:54:52,047 --> 00:54:53,423
I'm leaving you.

492
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:02,390
Claire.

493
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:10,612
