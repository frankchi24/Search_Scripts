00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:43,963
Do you renew your commitment to this
woman as your lawful wedded wife,

3
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:47,842
to love her, honor her, comfort her,

4
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,511
keep her in sickness and in health,

5
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:54,932
forsaking all others, be true to her,
as long as you both shall live?

6
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,351
I do.

7
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:01,022
Do you renew
your commitment to this man

8
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:02,690
as your lawful wedded husband,

9
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:06,276
to love him, honor him, comfort him,

10
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,155
keep him in sickness and in health,

11
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:13,951
forsaking all others, be true to him,
as long as you both shall live?

12
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:16,746
I do.

13
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:20,208
May this renewed commitment
deepen your love for each other

14
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,002
and strengthen your eternal bond.

15
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:40,061
ONE MONTH EARLIER

16
00:02:42,063 --> 00:02:43,355
Francis?

17
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:49,862
No photographs when they unload his body.
Will you promise me that?

18
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:24,312
A lot of people are calling you a hero.

19
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:28,067
A lot of people aren't.

20
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:54,343
Francis, I will get this
peacekeeping resolution

21
00:03:54,426 --> 00:03:56,470
passed through the General Assembly.

22
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:00,850
I owe you that.

23
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,732
So we have the photograph tomorrow
for the presidential portrait.

24
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,319
It's what they're gonna
base the painting on.

25
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,657
I'll be smiling. Will you?

26
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:25,666
What are they doing?

27
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:29,170
Part of a...
cultural exchange, sir, with Tibet.

28
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:31,047
They'll be here for a month.

29
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,464
A month?

30
00:05:10,794 --> 00:05:12,922
Don't worry,
your handwriting's atrocious.

31
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:14,590
Couldn't read a thing.

32
00:05:14,673 --> 00:05:17,134
- Tom.
- I know. Kate Baldwin.

33
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:18,302
I know.

34
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:19,511
Oh. Gold stars for us.

35
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:23,099
It only took two months riding
on the same plane to introduce ourselves.

36
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:24,767
Maybe I'm shy.

37
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,353
Oh, no, you're not.
You just don't mingle with the peasants.

38
00:05:27,435 --> 00:05:30,814
If one of us is a peasant,
I think it's me.

39
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:45,413
I'm sorry I can't stay here
in Gaffney with you.

40
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:47,123
It's okay.

41
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:48,916
I'll see you tomorrow.

42
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:52,211
Maybe tonight, if all goes well.

43
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:54,422
Feeling optimistic?

44
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,299
I made you a promise.

45
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,595
Well, go on.
You have a plane waiting.

46
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:05,724
Thank you.

47
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,562
Tom.

48
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:33,169
The Republicans are introducing
a bill that amends the Stafford Act.

49
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:35,838
They say that the siphoning
of FEMA funds for America Works

50
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,965
- violates the appropriation.
- So let them.

51
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,883
It's got bipartisan support.

52
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,927
Dunbar's going to publicly
support the bill.

53
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,971
- What about Jackie?
- She's trying to stay out of it,

54
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:46,307
but if it goes to a vote,
she's gotta go with the tide.

55
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,393
We don't want her poll numbers to take
a hit as she's starting to gain on Dunbar.

56
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:52,813
If they pass the bill, I'll veto it.
If they override, I'll refuse to enforce.

57
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:55,483
By the time it gets to the Supreme Court,
we'll have jobs to show,

58
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,444
they'll have nothing but rhetoric.
This is a public relations battle,

59
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:00,070
- not a legal one.
- Statement?

60
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:02,156
Just what I just said, less combative.

61
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:05,451
So, how do we want to do this?

62
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:07,911
I think the First Lady should sit.
You behind her.

63
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,872
Does that work for you,
Mrs. Underwood?

64
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,291
Uh, yes, whatever works best.

65
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,918
Let me adjust the light for her,
and then I'll place you, sir.

66
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:19,465
The African bloc just added a provision
to the peacekeeping resolution.

67
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:21,133
What does it say?

68
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:25,137
Requires African command of the forces.
It's a poison pill, Francis.

69
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,932
There's no way Israel or Palestine
will get on board with that.

70
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,767
You think the Russians are behind it?

71
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,729
Probably. Cathy and I are investigating.

72
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:36,524
All right, Mr. President.
Just behind your wife, please.

73
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:44,865
Do you prefer I not?

74
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:45,991
What?

75
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,827
Where you had your hand is perfect.

76
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,789
Great. All right.
Here we go.

77
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:57,711
A little more of a smile, please.

78
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:04,343
Come in.

79
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:11,517
Any luck today?

80
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,937
Moryakov... says it wasn't them.

81
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,023
Not that I trust him.

82
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:23,404
So now I just need to see
if I can get Zimbabwe to talk.

83
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:30,202
Today, when we took the photo...

84
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,872
I touched your shoulder.

85
00:08:35,165 --> 00:08:36,792
Yes?

86
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,669
You flinched.

87
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,381
- What?
- I felt it.

88
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,468
No, I didn't.

89
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:48,637
It was like...

90
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:52,141
you recoiled.

91
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:58,481
I think you're reading
too much into something

92
00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:01,191
that I don't think actually happened.

93
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:06,905
All right. Forget I said anything.

94
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,534
Wait.

95
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,329
I just...

96
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,874
Never mind.
I don't know what I was gonna say.

97
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:27,884
Good night.

98
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,855
House must've been somewhere out there.

99
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:25,275
Well, if you can call it a house.
It was no bigger than that truck.

100
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:29,405
Nothing left of the farm,
which is for the best.

101
00:10:29,488 --> 00:10:32,408
Peaches didn't want to grow here anyway.

102
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:34,660
That's what you get for planting on land

103
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:38,955
with solid rock
two feet below the topsoil.

104
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,625
You know, that's one of the points
that we should make in the book,

105
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:45,546
that hard work is only worth it
in the right conditions.

106
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:48,215
We want to set people up for success.

107
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:51,801
Vocational training,
legitimate career paths.

108
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:01,562
Welcome back. How was Gaffney?

109
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,106
Do we have a time set
for Ambassador Caspi yet?

110
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:05,941
Her office is stalling.

111
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:07,859
Get her schedule.
We'll go wherever she is.

112
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:09,945
I think she'll be
at the cocktail reception tonight

113
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:12,531
- at the Mexican Consulate.
- I'll call and find out.

114
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,075
What's that?

115
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:16,868
It came in for you this morning.

116
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,245
Francis?

117
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:20,748
John Pasternak.
Michael Corrigan's husband.

118
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,126
The latest pile of interview requests
is on your desk,

119
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,169
most of them Corrigan related.

120
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:29,881
And GLAAD wants you to be a keynote
speaker at their Media Awards Ceremony.

121
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,300
How did he know?

122
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:33,594
About your vows?
It's been in the news.

123
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:36,472
No, that I liked tulips.

124
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:47,775
- Did your mother work?
- As a maid, mostly.

125
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:50,026
- In high demand, because she was white.
- Mm-hm.

126
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,863
People assumed she wouldn't steal
any valuables, but of course she did.

127
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,823
Uh-huh.

128
00:11:55,907 --> 00:12:00,370
I remember one night, she came home
with two sapphire earrings.

129
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:03,206
She took them to the pawn shop
in Spartanburg the next day,

130
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,376
but she wore them all night long,
even slept in them.

131
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:10,589
I guess she wanted to know
what it felt like to have real jewelry,

132
00:12:10,673 --> 00:12:12,591
even if it was just for a few hours.

133
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:15,761
That does not go in the book.

134
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:19,348
Why didn't your parents
have any more kids?

135
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:20,974
That's not relevant to what we're doing.

136
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,810
I'm just trying to get a sense
of your family.

137
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,061
The barn must've been
somewhere right over there.

138
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,856
My father used to escape
in there to get away from us.

139
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,900
Usually brought a bottle with him.

140
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,778
Did you love your father?

141
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,155
He was a good man, down deep.

142
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,824
He cared for us greatly.

143
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:38,908
Worked hard to put food on the table.

144
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:41,911
Didn't always succeed,
but that wasn't for a lack of trying.

145
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,707
See... that's not an answer.

146
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,084
I asked you if you loved your father,
you don't tell me.

147
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,420
You tell me what you want me to write.

148
00:12:50,504 --> 00:12:52,840
Which is what you've done
since the beginning.

149
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:54,882
It's time to start telling the truth.

150
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:57,386
- You think I've been lying?
- I know you have.

151
00:12:57,469 --> 00:13:01,473
The only time you haven't
is that one night in the White House.

152
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:04,226
The worst adventure
I've ever been on. I can promise you...

153
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,770
- I don't get it.
- The game is unwinnable.

154
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,482
- What is the point?
- That is the point.

155
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,028
I find it unlikely that we'll ever
progress by starting over and over again.

156
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,155
- But it's got to be better than this.
- Oh, God.

157
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:19,199
Okay, let's give it a shot. Why not?

158
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:23,412
- Something was very clear.
- It just started over again.

159
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,539
It keeps doing that over and over.

160
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:28,166
Ignore his instructions,
he sends you back.

161
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,335
What if I follow his instructions?

162
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:33,797
- Hm... Chaos takes over. Randomness.
- Ah.

163
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:36,800
It's impossible to follow the rules.

164
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:39,553
Another time.
It's too much like my real life.

165
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:41,471
Mm...

166
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:45,517
Besides, we shouldn't be playing games.
You should be asking me questions.

167
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:48,228
You're getting me drunk.

168
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,814
- I won't remember what I asked.
- Mm...

169
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,736
The last time I got this drunk,
I broke into a library.

170
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:58,739
- In Charleston, my alma mater.
- Hm...

171
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:00,490
The Sentinel.

172
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,992
I almost puked all over myself.

173
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,828
That's Chapter Eight:
"POTUS Blows Chunks."

174
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,667
Can you keep it down, please?

175
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,129
- Come join us.
- So sorry.

176
00:14:14,212 --> 00:14:16,465
- I was asleep.
- Oh. We'll...

177
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:18,592
- We'll move into the study.
- Thank you.

178
00:14:37,736 --> 00:14:39,279
Francis?

179
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:42,198
I'll be right there in a minute.

180
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:47,036
I don't like him being up here.

181
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:49,832
We'll be more quiet.

182
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:51,959
This is our private space.

183
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:55,253
- He's my guest.
- He's a stranger.

184
00:14:57,255 --> 00:15:00,801
All right. After tonight, no more.

185
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,762
I'm not being unreasonable.

186
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:10,101
I should've...

187
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:13,939
realized how much noise we were making.

188
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,444
Can I ask you a question?

189
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,322
Well, that's what you're here for,
isn't it?

190
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:27,828
Why don't you sleep in the same room?

191
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:37,170
Uh, that just sorta happened over...

192
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:40,298
a few months after we moved in here.

193
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:41,925
Everything okay?

194
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,301
Between you two?

195
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:44,594
Oh, you bet.

196
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,392
Well, it's been better.

197
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,232
No, it's not okay.

198
00:15:57,315 --> 00:16:01,904
The fight.
Coming back from Moscow.

199
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,490
You heard us?

200
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:07,784
The yelling. Not what you said.

201
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:11,120
Hm...

202
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,666
We don't fight often, but, uh...

203
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:22,049
This one...

204
00:16:24,342 --> 00:16:26,428
scabs keep coming off.

205
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:27,930
Hm.

206
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:31,266
We said things.

207
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:36,939
Things you just can't take back.

208
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,360
It's late. We should call it a night.

209
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:57,000
Thomas.

210
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,381
I have no interest in salaciousness.

211
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:15,143
August fourteenth
is the anniversary of the New Deal.

212
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:18,480
- I'd like to hit 20,000 by that date.
- I believe we can do that, sir.

213
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:21,733
Remy, what's the timeline
on the Senate bill outlawing FEMA funds?

214
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:24,694
The Leg office predicts the Senate
version will pass in two to three weeks.

215
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,781
Working with friendlies in the House.
Throw some pork on it, slow it down.

216
00:17:27,864 --> 00:17:29,992
That's all the more reason
that we need to accelerate.

217
00:17:30,075 --> 00:17:31,493
If I'm gonna veto this bill,

218
00:17:31,576 --> 00:17:35,246
I want it to be because
it's gonna kill 50,000 new jobs.

219
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,206
- Jobs that we created.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,416
Cathy?

221
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,377
The Russians remain intransigent
on the Jordan Valley.

222
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:45,214
The ambassador is working hard to push
the peacekeeping resolution to a vote

223
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,216
- by the General Assembly.
- Why the delay?

224
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,719
We're having a hard time
getting the African bloc

225
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,513
to remove the poison pill provision.

226
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,932
We think Israel's behind it.
They got cold feet,

227
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:57,519
convinced the African bloc to sabotage
the resolution so they have an out.

228
00:17:57,602 --> 00:17:59,521
Do I need to speak
to the Prime Minister?

229
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:01,940
Uh, the Israeli ambassador
has already denied.

230
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:04,484
I think we need to keep our focus
on the provision itself.

231
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:05,861
All right.

232
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:07,904
The head of the African bloc
is Zimbabwe.

233
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:12,534
And we believe Israel has promised them
a sizable aid package for HIV prevention.

234
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:15,912
The Secretary and I recommend increasing
our relief funds to Zimbabwe.

235
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:17,372
Outspend the Israelis.

236
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:19,499
Well, President Chimbetu
will just pocket the money.

237
00:18:19,582 --> 00:18:22,169
Well, we always anticipate
a certain level of graft.

238
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:25,421
A certain level? He's egregious.
The man's a monster.

239
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,132
Who happens to run the African bloc.

240
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:29,551
Who happens to kill his people
when he's not stealing from them,

241
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:31,386
which is why I reduced aid to Zimbabwe.

242
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:34,931
If we want him to remove the amendment,
we have to be persuasive.

243
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,392
We are scraping together
every penny we can to save AmWorks.

244
00:18:37,475 --> 00:18:40,937
The last thing I want is to be slammed
for giving additional money

245
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:45,734
to a brutal dictator from USAID just
to persuade him. This is ill-conceived.

246
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:48,361
You should think before you bring
a proposal such as this.

247
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:51,406
We'll pursue other strategies
and get back to you, Mr. President.

248
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:53,783
Thank you. Robert,
what's the latest on the omnibus?

249
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,619
The legislation should go to
the floor in the next couple of months.

250
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:57,871
The leadership is pushing...

251
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,519
Set up calls with both
Lockheed and Northrop.

252
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:24,272
We'll pay people to get trained
and call it a job.

253
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,233
It isn't a job
unless the union says it is.

254
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:29,903
Well, one step at a time. You set up
the training and I'll speak to the AFL.

255
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:31,279
Are the AARP here?

256
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:34,323
In the lobby. The chairman told me
they want to support Dunbar.

257
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,742
They're just trying to rattle us.

258
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:37,786
Dunbar is promising
to save Social Security.

259
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:40,663
Go after Wall Street and government
waste instead of entitlements.

260
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:41,748
Well, get them in here.

261
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:44,709
You have your call list. Their meeting's
not for another ten minutes.

262
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:48,004
Start bringing them over. It'll take them
that long to hobble over on their walkers.

263
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,381
- Francis?
- I'll go get them.

264
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:52,092
I only have a few minutes.

265
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:02,477
You singled me out today on purpose.

266
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,980
- What?
- The cabinet meeting.

267
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:06,940
If I'm gonna invite you
to cabinet meetings,

268
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:08,900
there's not gonna be any kid gloves.

269
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,693
Don't make it sound like a favor.

270
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,612
You wanted to be there. I agreed.

271
00:20:12,695 --> 00:20:15,115
Well, so I could be informed
and do my job.

272
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:18,118
Everyone in that room is judged
by what they bring to the table.

273
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:20,536
What you brought to the table
was amateurish.

274
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,290
Both Cathy and I proposed that plan.

275
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:26,251
I fault her as much as you.
You're making this too personal.

276
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:30,172
It is personal. I think you're
punishing me for what happened in Russia.

277
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:31,798
Oh, come on.

278
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:34,926
Well, you said it on the plane.
Appointing me was a mistake.

279
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,928
Yeah, you said far worse things to me.

280
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:40,098
Yes, and I've gone out of my way
to put that fight behind us.

281
00:20:40,182 --> 00:20:42,100
Oh, really? Like with Thomas?

282
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:44,019
When you screamed at us
for waking you up.

283
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:46,229
- I didn't scream.
- It was embarrassing.

284
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:47,689
Who cares what he thinks?

285
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,941
He was our guest
and you walked in there like--

286
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:52,152
I think you're searching for things
that aren't there

287
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:55,238
and ignoring the things that are,
like this photograph flinching nonsense.

288
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,906
Oh, Jesus.

289
00:20:59,117 --> 00:21:02,120
- Do you want me to resign, Francis?
- Don't be ridiculous.

290
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:04,539
Just say it.

291
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:06,791
You never wanted me to be ambassador.

292
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,751
You remember what you
said to me on the plane?

293
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,670
You should have never made me president.

294
00:21:10,753 --> 00:21:12,380
I was upset. I didn't mean it.

295
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:14,632
You did mean it.
You think you made me.

296
00:21:14,716 --> 00:21:17,426
No, I don't.
I think we're a team, actually.

297
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,512
Well, we're not a team at the moment.

298
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,519
I can't believe we've become this.

299
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,647
- Become what?
- Like everyone else.

300
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,320
You ready, sir?

301
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:37,530
No, just give me a minute.
Let the smoke clear.

302
00:22:02,931 --> 00:22:04,432
Where are we at?

303
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,462
Her hair's different.

304
00:22:36,547 --> 00:22:38,091
But I--

305
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:41,428
- Where was this taken?
- Santa Fe.

306
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,638
I've narrowed the search
to focus just on that city.

307
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,266
This is all I have,
but I think it's a good start.

308
00:22:47,474 --> 00:22:50,561
- I should go there.
- No. These photos are three weeks old.

309
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:53,815
- She might have been passing through.
- Or she might still be there.

310
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:57,193
Okay, but if you start asking questions,
you might tip her off.

311
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:59,279
Get me more, then.

312
00:23:01,572 --> 00:23:03,199
How's my passport coming?

313
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:08,246
I'll get the lock lifted
when you find her.

314
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,082
I've shown you some progress.

315
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,835
I think I should be seeing
progress on your side, too.

316
00:23:13,918 --> 00:23:14,877
This isn't enough.

317
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,963
They just arrested
another one of my friends.

318
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:19,506
- They could charge me at any minute.
- Gavin...

319
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,927
The things that I've had to do
to get this much are fucked up.

320
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:25,347
An exact location.

321
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:27,432
That was our deal.

322
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:35,690
Can you get me the camera feed?

323
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:37,275
The system's monitoring it.

324
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,027
I want it, too.

325
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,158
I'll send you the link.

326
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:21,194
Doug? This is Maurice.

327
00:24:21,277 --> 00:24:24,072
He'll be taking over for me.
I'm moving to Seattle.

328
00:24:24,155 --> 00:24:28,076
My sister's opening up her own PT center
and she wants me to be a partner.

329
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,578
I'm moving all my clients
over to new folks.

330
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:34,457
So I can help the transition.

331
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,792
I'll be sad to see you go.

332
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:40,422
I'll go get some bar floats.

333
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:42,090
Back in a second.

334
00:24:44,175 --> 00:24:48,179
Look... I'm having people over
this Thursday.

335
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:51,516
It's a going-away thing at my place.
You should come.

336
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:53,851
- You ready?
- Yeah.

337
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:55,895
I'll text you the details.

338
00:25:04,987 --> 00:25:08,116
I want to go after the big boys.
Not just Wall Street, but Walmart.

339
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:11,327
I'd be careful with Walmart.
You'll lose a lot of friends in Congress.

340
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:15,081
Let's force them to take sides.
That means Jackie Sharp, too.

341
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:16,583
Introduce legislation.

342
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:18,960
She either votes for it
or we hit her hard.

343
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:22,297
Any corporation who has more than ten
percent of its employees on food stamps

344
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,841
has to increase wages
until they're below ten percent.

345
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:29,678
Who has the guts
to sponsor something like that?

346
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:41,065
Doug?

347
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:45,445
Yeah, I'll put a list together. You'll
have something by the end of the week.

348
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:46,695
Okay. Talk to you then.

349
00:26:18,478 --> 00:26:21,523
- You made it.
- Yeah.

350
00:26:22,898 --> 00:26:25,276
- How long have you been here?
- Ten minutes.

351
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,029
Come on.
We need to get people dancing.

352
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:30,198
Actually, I was thinking
that I should go.

353
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:32,783
I just came over to say goodbye.

354
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:36,412
Uh-uh. No. You are not going anywhere.

355
00:26:36,496 --> 00:26:41,334
You don't have to dance,
but you can't leave.

356
00:26:56,474 --> 00:26:58,309
Last man standing.

357
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,772
- You have recycling?
- Just leave 'em on the counter.

358
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,900
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

359
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:12,574
You really don't have to help.

360
00:27:12,657 --> 00:27:14,200
I don't mind.

361
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:18,913
You're such a gentleman.

362
00:27:18,996 --> 00:27:21,040
I don't know about that.

363
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:23,334
Oh, you're not a gentleman?

364
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:27,714
Because... that could be interesting.

365
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:09,380
I made you a café au lait.

366
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:11,340
Oh...

367
00:28:19,181 --> 00:28:20,683
How is it?

368
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,727
- Need sugar?
- No.

369
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,395
It's perfect.

370
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:27,898
When are the movers coming by?

371
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:31,026
Not for a couple hours.

372
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,489
You need any help?
Packing the rest up?

373
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:36,574
No. You just relax.

374
00:28:40,578 --> 00:28:43,122
You seemed a little sad last night.

375
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:46,709
No, just tired.

376
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:49,962
Was that it?
You were just tired?

377
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:57,845
Someone I haven't heard from
in a long time.

378
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:01,015
She reached out. It was--

379
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:02,767
It was a little hard.

380
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:08,272
Last night wasn't 'cause
you felt sorry for me, was it?

381
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:10,399
No.

382
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:14,487
Last night was because
I'm getting on a plane today,

383
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,406
and I'll probably never see you again.

384
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,241
Why not?

385
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:32,254
You know it rains a lot in Seattle, right?

386
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:06,789
Are you gonna come with me
to the memorial today?

387
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:09,375
Do I need to be there?

388
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:10,877
No.

389
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,882
I'm buried right now.

390
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:17,425
Fine.

391
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:57,381
Why has Tom Yates been
hanging around so much?

392
00:30:57,465 --> 00:30:59,174
Is he writing a book on the president?

393
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:01,552
We've all asked him and he won't say.

394
00:31:01,636 --> 00:31:03,679
Ballsy move if it's true.

395
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:06,181
Yeah. I can't stand his writing.

396
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:08,810
Are you an idiot?

397
00:31:08,893 --> 00:31:10,728
I'm an idiot for having an opinion?

398
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:13,355
There's no opinions to be had.
His writing is gorgeous.

399
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:15,691
Well, in my opinion, it isn't.

400
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:17,735
Said the guy who can't write
a grocery list.

401
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:20,446
- Shh, shh...
- Ready whenever you are, sir.

402
00:31:24,032 --> 00:31:27,787
Today marks the 80th Anniversary
of the Social Security Act.

403
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,749
It has survived longer
than many of its beneficiaries.

404
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:35,628
We should all be so lucky
to live as long as it has.

405
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:40,132
But by the time the human body
has circled the sun 80 times,

406
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:42,718
its youth and vigor are gone.

407
00:31:42,802 --> 00:31:46,013
Joints ache,
bones and muscles are weaker,

408
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:49,809
the heart doesn't beat
with the same power it once did.

409
00:31:49,892 --> 00:31:52,937
All of us must face this truth eventually.

410
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,190
And when we do,
we must hand the baton to the young.

411
00:31:56,273 --> 00:32:01,153
To those who have the strength
to carry on our work when we are gone.

412
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:05,741
Here's another truth:
Social Security is dying.

413
00:32:05,825 --> 00:32:08,160
Now in its 80th year, it must give way

414
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:12,331
to a new, younger,
stronger plan for the future.

415
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:15,001
That plan is America Works.

416
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:18,754
In Washington DC alone,
we've managed to reduce unemployment

417
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:23,676
by over a third
and put 25,000 people to work.

418
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,014
If we can accomplish so much
in so little time here in Washington,

419
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:32,518
imagine what we could accomplish if
Congress funded America Works nationwide.

420
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,979
We wouldn't be talking
about thousands of jobs.

421
00:32:35,062 --> 00:32:38,440
We'd be talking about millions.

422
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:43,404
Later this afternoon, I will visit FDR's
memorial to pay my respects to the man

423
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:47,115
who ushered in Social Security
80 years ago.

424
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,912
We honor the dead for giving us
the world we inherited.

425
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:57,543
However, we must recognize we are doomed
if we allow the dead to govern us.

426
00:32:57,626 --> 00:33:02,172
Thank you, and God bless
the United States of America.

427
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:04,926
From NBC News in Washington,

428
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:08,220
this is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd.

429
00:33:08,303 --> 00:33:10,598
Good morning and welcome
to Meet the Press.

430
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:13,642
I have with me Congresswoman Huntley
and Congressman Greer.

431
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:16,979
Congresswoman, let me start with you.
In the President's radio address today,

432
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:21,316
he said the model here in Washington
is a model for the nation.

433
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,402
- Do you agree?
- I do, Chuck.

434
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:25,446
I was skeptical at first.

435
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:27,907
Both my parents benefited
from Social Security.

436
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,576
And I've always
counted on it for myself.

437
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,996
But, when I think about my kids,
and my grandkids--

438
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,248
Rebecca raises a good point,
one that we've been making

439
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:37,875
in the Republican Party for decades.

440
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:40,252
And yet, while you support America Works,

441
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:42,463
most members of your party do not.

442
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:44,882
Chuck, I've never been
a big fan of Frank Underwood.

443
00:33:44,966 --> 00:33:48,928
But the park near my house here
in Washington has never been cleaner.

444
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:52,180
The dry cleaners I go to just hired
two new people this month.

445
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:55,309
The daycare I drop my kids off at
doubled their staff

446
00:33:55,392 --> 00:33:57,728
so the children can get
more individual attention.

447
00:33:57,812 --> 00:34:00,940
The president may have overstepped
in taking FEMA money,

448
00:34:01,023 --> 00:34:04,986
but when something works, it works.
And America Works works.

449
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:12,636
Hello.

450
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:21,348
Promise the money.

451
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:25,727
Whatever you need to turn him around.
I'll approve the USAID funds.

452
00:37:27,855 --> 00:37:30,107
What made you change your mind?

453
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:36,113
Today... at the memorial.

454
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:41,035
You know what struck me the most?

455
00:37:44,205 --> 00:37:45,998
Eleanor.

456
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:50,169
She was off by herself.

457
00:37:50,252 --> 00:37:52,046
Alone.

458
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:56,050
And so was Franklin. He was alone.

459
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:01,722
And there was a wall between them.

460
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,686
The monks.

461
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:11,148
They've been here for weeks.
We haven't even discussed them once.

462
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:14,776
It's beautiful, isn't it?
What they're doing?

463
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,403
It is.

464
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,411
Francis, I watched them
for over an hour today.

465
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:28,749
And all I was thinking was, why aren't
you and I sharing this together?

466
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,011
We have to do something, Claire.

467
00:38:43,138 --> 00:38:44,639
I know.

468
00:38:48,435 --> 00:38:50,062
What are you thinking?

469
00:38:50,145 --> 00:38:53,815
My natural color.
Like when I first met Francis.

470
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:57,694
- This color?
- Yes. Exactly.

471
00:38:57,778 --> 00:38:59,321
Okay. Have a seat.

472
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:19,967
I want to take up the sleeves a touch.

473
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,510
Oh, I think they're perfect.
Thank you.

474
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:30,394
- What do you think?
- Beautiful.

475
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:57,129
We have gathered today to renew
the vows between Francis J. Underwood

476
00:39:57,212 --> 00:40:00,715
and Claire Hale Underwood.

477
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:07,181
It was here, in this church,

478
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:10,851
28 years ago, before God,

479
00:40:10,934 --> 00:40:14,313
that you two first committed
yourselves to one another.

480
00:40:21,028 --> 00:40:24,448
May this renewed commitment
deepen your love for each other,

481
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:27,034
and strengthen your eternal bond.

482
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:12,162
Claire's father bought us this house.

483
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:15,749
I wanted to pay for it myself.
That's always bothered me.

484
00:41:15,832 --> 00:41:18,668
You weren't bothered to let him pay
for your first campaign?

485
00:41:18,752 --> 00:41:22,672
Well, that's politics. It's different.
You take money wherever you can get it.

486
00:41:22,756 --> 00:41:24,925
No, this was our first home.

487
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:28,595
- Was it a happy home?
- Oh, please.

488
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:33,350
I thought you brought me here because
we were gonna cut through the bullshit.

489
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,352
This book is supposed to be
about America Works.

490
00:41:35,436 --> 00:41:37,729
There is no book
without you at the center of it.

491
00:41:39,356 --> 00:41:41,733
Do you trust me? Or don't you?

492
00:41:41,816 --> 00:41:43,860
Because if you don't,
get someone else to write it.

493
00:41:43,944 --> 00:41:44,945
Or write it yourself.

494
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:48,407
You don't know what it's like to go
through life looking over your shoulder.

495
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,825
Having secrets no one would understand.

496
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,786
I didn't write my first book.

497
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:56,206
My friend.

498
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:01,336
- The one who died.
- He wrote it?

499
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,214
The first half.
He didn't show it to anyone except me.

500
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:06,716
In the hospital, he asked me destroy it.

501
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,594
I told him I would.

502
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:14,015
It was too good.

503
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,310
It needed to be finished.
So I finished it.

504
00:42:16,393 --> 00:42:21,189
- And took all the credit.
- Oh, yeah. It's my part, the ending.

505
00:42:21,273 --> 00:42:22,816
That's what people remember.

506
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:25,777
But the book...

507
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,448
My entire career...

508
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,410
It's all based on a lie.

509
00:42:33,494 --> 00:42:36,246
You don't have a monopoly on secrets.

510
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:51,678
There's tulips buried under here.

511
00:42:53,514 --> 00:42:55,432
Claire planted them.

512
00:42:59,853 --> 00:43:01,605
I've always...

513
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:05,859
from day one...

514
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:11,239
been ashamed she said yes
when I asked her to marry me.

515
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:12,907
Why?

516
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:17,329
I didn't think I deserved her.

517
00:43:20,123 --> 00:43:23,585
I can tell you this, though, there would
have been no White House without Claire.

518
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:26,213
I was half the man before I met her.

519
00:43:26,296 --> 00:43:28,923
But still, I've been selfish...

520
00:43:30,467 --> 00:43:32,802
feeding off her the way I have.

521
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:34,846
She knew what she was getting into.

522
00:43:36,097 --> 00:43:40,727
Probably. She knows me
better than I know myself.

523
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:44,356
Sir? We're scheduled to fly out at 6:15.

524
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,400
Should probably leave
in the next few minutes.

525
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:48,402
Thank you, Meechum.

526
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:54,866
Scribble away.

527
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:07,754
So, what'd he tell you
in front of the house?

528
00:44:07,837 --> 00:44:09,423
Mm...

529
00:44:09,506 --> 00:44:11,049
Nothing much.

530
00:44:11,132 --> 00:44:13,134
Well, it looked intense,
whatever it was.

531
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:17,305
See? This is why I don't ride in the van.

532
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:19,307
You did this time.

533
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,271
Sometimes you just need
to leave someone alone.

534
00:44:24,354 --> 00:44:27,524
All right, I got the hint.

535
00:44:27,608 --> 00:44:31,570
I meant him. Not me.

536
00:44:57,596 --> 00:44:59,473
Where are they?

537
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:02,350
- Who?
- The monks.

538
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,852
Oh, they finished earlier today, sir.

539
00:45:05,811 --> 00:45:07,564
So it's gone?

540
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:09,941
I believe so.

541
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:12,152
I didn't get a chance to see it.

542
00:45:12,235 --> 00:45:14,070
I'm sure they took a photo.

543
00:45:16,156 --> 00:45:18,742
Will you ask someone to get me a copy?

544
00:45:18,824 --> 00:45:20,826
Right away, sir.

545
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:25,183
Thank you.

546
00:46:30,313 --> 00:46:33,233
Claire.
I almost didn't recognize you.

547
00:46:33,316 --> 00:46:35,943
Yes,
I decided it was time for a change.

548
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:37,863
It's very fetching.

549
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:40,073
I hope you don't mind me
crashing your party.

550
00:46:40,156 --> 00:46:43,326
Oh, of course not.
My staff said you'd be out of town.

551
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,080
Would you mind if I borrowed
Ambassador Caspi for a moment?

552
00:46:47,163 --> 00:46:48,164
Of course.

553
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:54,671
- You've been avoiding me for three weeks.
- I had a trip to Jerusalem.

554
00:46:56,339 --> 00:46:58,383
You promised Zimbabwe 35 million

555
00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:01,177
so they'd introduce
the poison pill amendment.

556
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:03,555
- For purely humanitarian reasons.
- No.

557
00:47:03,638 --> 00:47:07,350
This is the first time
you've ever sent aid to Zimbabwe.

558
00:47:07,434 --> 00:47:10,103
Don't draw connections that don't exist.

559
00:47:10,186 --> 00:47:13,565
We would never try
to sabotage the resolution.

560
00:47:13,648 --> 00:47:17,402
- The United States is our ally.
- That's right, we are.

561
00:47:17,485 --> 00:47:21,072
- So act like it.
- Excuse me?

562
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:25,452
My husband formally approved our own
humanitarian package for eighty million.

563
00:47:25,535 --> 00:47:30,164
Zimbabwe will be withdrawing
the amendment tomorrow.

564
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:32,333
And when the resolution goes to a vote,

565
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:35,837
I expect Israel to support it
like the loyal ally she is.

566
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,881
Not lie to us.

567
00:47:37,963 --> 00:47:40,216
That's not the way to solicit our support.

568
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,637
I'm not soliciting. I'm demanding.

569
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,389
I feel sorry for you, Claire.

570
00:47:46,473 --> 00:47:49,643
Your husband sends you to talk tough.

571
00:47:49,726 --> 00:47:52,562
But as soon as things go wrong
in the Jordan Valley,

572
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:55,482
he'll turn his back and leave Israel
to clean up the mess.

573
00:47:55,565 --> 00:47:57,024
He doesn't have the muscle.

574
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:59,193
He can't even get Congress
to work with him.

575
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:01,488
Or back you up after you call out Petrov.

576
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:04,616
He turned his back on you
just like he will on us.

577
00:48:06,992 --> 00:48:11,164
My husband is the bravest
and most resolute man I know.

578
00:48:11,247 --> 00:48:12,666
He will succeed in this plan.

579
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:14,459
Brave?

580
00:48:14,542 --> 00:48:16,377
I served in Jordan Valley.

581
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:19,088
As did the President
and the Foreign Minister. Has he?

582
00:48:20,674 --> 00:48:24,511
You held a gun and somebody
told you where to stand.

583
00:48:24,594 --> 00:48:29,432
Don't confuse that with the burden
the Commander in Chief faces.

584
00:48:29,516 --> 00:48:31,184
Francis has given the order to kill.

585
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:33,728
He's buried soldiers
he's put into harm's way.

586
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:36,648
And every day,
he wakes up bearing responsibilities

587
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:38,817
you can't possibly imagine.

588
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,486
They would crush you
if they fell on your shoulders.

589
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:43,655
So you talk to your superiors.

590
00:48:44,614 --> 00:48:47,241
And when the amendment
is withdrawn tomorrow,

591
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:51,162
you will commit
to supporting the resolution.

592
00:49:34,873 --> 00:49:36,207
Oh...

593
00:50:26,049 --> 00:50:30,753
