"Title One of the Stafford Act:

3
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,553
'Emergency' means any occasion
or instance for which,

4
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:52,597
in the determination
of the president..."

5
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,058
"Determined" by the president.

6
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:57,059
- Any instance?
- As long as we can make the argument

7
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:59,354
that this saves lives
and protects health and safety.

8
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:01,606
Well, unemployment leads to crime,

9
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,860
to malnutrition,
to improper medical care.

10
00:02:04,943 --> 00:02:07,362
There's no doubt it'll
be challenged in the courts.

11
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:09,113
Well, even so, by the time that happens,

12
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:11,658
people will see what
America Works looks like.

13
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:14,995
Tell me, in your legal opinion...

14
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:17,831
is there enough leeway here?

15
00:02:17,914 --> 00:02:19,833
Yes, the language is sufficiently vague.

16
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,878
But just to be clear,
this is completely unorthodox.

17
00:02:22,961 --> 00:02:25,755
No president has ever tried
to reappropriate funds this way.

18
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,966
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all I need.

19
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:32,679
The states won't go for this.
Too radical.

20
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:36,516
And if I call just one governor
who says no and leaks it to the press,

21
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,436
Congress will be on my ass
before I get this out of the gates.

22
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,564
But, the District of Columbia...

23
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:46,317
- No governor.
- Just you, the mayor.

24
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,778
Now, Barney, I know
this puts you out on a ledge.

25
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:51,907
I love it.
I love everything about it.

26
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,412
We have to fight Congress for every
dollar in our budget, each year.

27
00:02:57,495 --> 00:03:01,081
If my people see me take the money
they won't give us...

28
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:02,667
well, I just won reelection.

29
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:06,170
This is why you put a brawler
like Barney Hull in office,

30
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:08,172
aside from paying a debt.

31
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:11,509
Add up 50 governors
and 535 members of Congress,

32
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:15,137
you don't come close
to the gumption of one bold mayor.

33
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:18,433
I want people registering for jobs
in every part of the city

34
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:21,436
as soon as possible, before
the court challenges bubble up.

35
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,104
What about one big tent right
in front of the Capitol?

36
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:28,108
Make Congress see the people line up all
the way back to the Lincoln Memorial.

37
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:30,278
Can we do something by July Fourth?

38
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:33,197
You bring the fireworks,
I'll bring the people.

39
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,996
Good morning. Please, sit.

40
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,248
I know Remy has just briefed you all,

41
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:44,709
so, aside from the Secretary
of Homeland Security,

42
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:47,963
who is no longer with us,
does anyone else object to this plan?

43
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,841
Good. Until a new
secretary is confirmed,

44
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:55,011
FEMA will report directly to me.
Thank you all very much.

45
00:04:11,945 --> 00:04:15,364
Unemployment doesn't constitute
a natural disaster, Mr. President.

46
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:19,035
The Stafford Act gives me
full authority to define an emergency.

47
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,913
But, sir, we've only got
about three billion left

48
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:25,125
in the Disaster Relief Fund, and we're
about to go into hurricane season.

49
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:27,794
So we use the three billion
that's there, and if a hurricane hits,

50
00:04:27,877 --> 00:04:31,673
Congress replenishes the funds,
just as they always do.

51
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:35,051
When it comes to a disaster,
every hour counts, sir.

52
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:39,555
- If we're waiting around for Congress--
- Mr. Silva, this is moving forward.

53
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:42,350
People could die, Mr. President.

54
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:44,894
People are dying
because they don't have jobs.

55
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:48,356
Slower than a flood or an earthquake,
but dying just the same.

56
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:51,442
You can't compare unemployment
to a cat four hurricane.

57
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:54,863
I came to your office because
I want this to remain your office.

58
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:57,532
There's a reason three presidents
have kept you here.

59
00:04:57,615 --> 00:05:01,619
You're dedicated, you're relentless,
you're exceptionally competent.

60
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:04,539
If we have to stretch dollars even
further, you're the man to do it.

61
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:07,667
It's either you
or someone far less experienced.

62
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:12,005
The two of you head to Iowa
at the end of the week.

63
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:14,423
That's right.
Eighteen counties this trip.

64
00:05:14,507 --> 00:05:18,260
By January, I plan on hitting all 99.

65
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:22,473
John will join me at every event
until his husband is released.

66
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:24,642
Have you had any
contact with Michael since his arrest?

67
00:05:24,726 --> 00:05:28,730
The Russian government has refused.
They won't let him speak to a lawyer.

68
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:31,149
That's why it's important John join me.

69
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,526
We need to keep the pressure
up on Moscow.

70
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:35,444
You know,
gay rights is controversial

71
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:36,529
in many parts of the country.

72
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:38,990
Do you think that appearing
with Corrigan's husband

73
00:05:39,074 --> 00:05:40,240
could possibly hurt you?

74
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:43,411
I think the American people want
a candidate who doesn't dodge,

75
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:46,372
who is truthful about where she stands.

76
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,000
Not someone who shies away
from controversy.

77
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:51,002
It's one thing to shy away
from controversy.

78
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:52,670
It's another thing to court it.

79
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:55,590
Well, Michael was arrested
for speaking his mind.

80
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:58,843
If defending free speech is
controversial, then...

81
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,636
we're no better than Russia.

82
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,723
I wish that there were more people
in our government defending it.

83
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:07,018
Are you talking specifically
about the Underwood Administration?

84
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:08,770
I think the president
could do more.

85
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:12,023
You know, the White House
has said hat they've been speaking

86
00:06:12,107 --> 00:06:14,650
directly with the Kremlin,
that they, and I quote here:

87
00:06:14,734 --> 00:06:17,403
"Have to tackle this issue
as it relates to the larger

88
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:20,280
diplomatic relationship
between the two nations."

89
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:24,284
Then why haven't we seen
any evidence of those talks?

90
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:27,914
When I'm president,
the American people can rest assured

91
00:06:27,997 --> 00:06:33,669
that I will take my oath to defend
and protect our citizens seriously.

92
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:37,423
- What do you think of her?
- What, Dunbar?

93
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:38,841
Yeah.

94
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:41,010
I believe that the
administration could do better...

95
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:44,388
- You worked for Underwood.
- Not anymore.

96
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:47,683
I won't be offended.

97
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,189
Uh, I like a lot about
what she has to say.

98
00:06:56,358 --> 00:06:59,154
Would you vote for her?

99
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,864
I don't know. I might.

100
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:05,660
Yeah. Probably would.

101
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:08,204
- How soon?
- Tomorrow.

102
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,998
We're gonna get hit hard on this.

103
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:13,126
- Better than getting hit on Corrigan.
- You saw Vieira?

104
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:16,129
Dunbar's smart. She's running
against us before we're even running.

105
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:18,298
She'll attack us on the FEMA thing, too.

106
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,675
Then let her. At least
we're controlling the narrative.

107
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:22,802
When we first spoke,
you mentioned early fall.

108
00:07:22,885 --> 00:07:25,513
Look, Dunbar's got momentum
because no one's challenging her.

109
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:28,266
But once we drop the FEMA plan,
that'll take her off message.

110
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:31,144
And your candidacy will distract her.
It's a one-two punch.

111
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:32,895
We'll start bleeding away
the woman's vote.

112
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:34,939
I'm just not sure how smart it is
to rush into a campaign

113
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:37,233
- with so little preparation.
- This isn't a real campaign.

114
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:39,652
But it needs to look like one.

115
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:41,946
I thought you wanted to be on my ticket.

116
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,324
It's my reputation at stake.

117
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:46,993
- I don't want to look foolhardy.
- Look, no one--

118
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:49,912
Mayor's announcing in the morning.
Seth's working with his office.

119
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:51,706
You see, Jackie, this is perfect timing.

120
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:53,833
The FEMA plan goes into action,

121
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:56,669
you announce in a couple of weeks,
you say you had to run.

122
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:59,214
President Underwood
is being reckless with FEMA.

123
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:03,009
You come out against me and America
Works and you steal Dunbar's thunder.

124
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:06,346
And then I flip-flop when I pull out
and you put me on the ticket?

125
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:10,850
By then, 50,000 people will have jobs,
and it won't look like a flip-flop.

126
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:12,727
It'll look like you saw the light.

127
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,314
Now, look, why don't you go off
with Remy and you discuss the details,

128
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:19,275
and just give it some thought
before you decide.

129
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:23,404
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Let's talk in my office.

130
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,201
My biggest concern is funding.
I couldn't fly coach to Iowa.

131
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:30,161
I'll get you some PAC money
rolling your way.

132
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:32,121
Should be enough to get you started.

133
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,667
If I run, it shouldn't be half-ass.

134
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:39,379
Which is why we should talk about this.

135
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:47,136
You want a candidate
with a family.

136
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,513
We are after the woman's vote.

137
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,103
Alan and I have already talked about it.

138
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:56,478
You have?

139
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:01,401
Yeah. We joked about getting married
on our first date.

140
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:04,195
I get two kids
without the stretch marks.

141
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:10,826
And when I mentioned I might run,
it stopped becoming a joke.

142
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,538
Is Alan open to it?

143
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:16,791
- It was his idea.
- And what about you?

144
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:19,752
We do love each other.

145
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,712
Hm. He seems like a good guy.

146
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,840
He is. And his children are wonderful.

147
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:28,719
You should think about getting hitched.

148
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:34,058
Should we talk timeline?

149
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,727
- For marriage?
- The campaign.

150
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:52,910
This is far from an offer.
This is a conversation.

151
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:55,330
And it's a conversation
that never happened.

152
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:57,539
I took the back door in,
I'll take the back door out.

153
00:09:57,623 --> 00:10:01,252
We keep you off the payroll this quarter.
You start officially September 30th.

154
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:04,005
Next quarter's FEC filings. It's fine.

155
00:10:05,298 --> 00:10:06,882
What are you thinking
in terms of salary?

156
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:09,593
Twenty-two thousand per quarter.

157
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,805
That's way below what I'm worth.
Even in this state.

158
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,265
What do you think's appropriate?

159
00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:16,684
Two-fifty and three points
on the ad-buy.

160
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:19,479
- That's beyond our means.
- No, it's not.

161
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:21,314
It's a drop in the bucket
from your estate.

162
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:24,984
You said you wanted in
because you believed in this campaign.

163
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:27,862
- That's right.
- Sounds like it's more about money.

164
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:32,408
It's about being valued.
Two-fifty and the points is a bargain.

165
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:35,286
I want to work for you,
just not as a beggar.

166
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,538
We don't trust you yet, Doug.

167
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:41,000
We don't even halfway trust you,
so you are a beggar.

168
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:44,753
And you shouldn't trust me...
until I prove myself.

169
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:48,549
That's a gamble you don't get to take
without putting chips on the table.

170
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,094
Cynthia and I will discuss.

171
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,351
Thank you for your time.

172
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:05,525
Let me check first.

173
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,653
Okay, it's clear.

174
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,327
- What do you think?
- Why take the gamble?

175
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:18,037
I don't want us
to start making decisions

176
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,415
from a position of weakness.
That is how you lose.

177
00:11:20,498 --> 00:11:22,666
I think we're inviting the fox
into the hen house.

178
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,003
Anyone who wants to be a mole accepts
the first offer without question.

179
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:27,629
He's negotiating.

180
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:29,840
So you actually believe him?

181
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:33,593
Not necessarily.

182
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:38,891
But that doesn't mean
that he doesn't have value.

183
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:44,604
Yeah, we're not gonna need any of these.
We're gonna keep these right here.

184
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:47,649
- Kate Baldwin, the one and only.
- I thought I heard somebody in here.

185
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:51,112
Welcome to the White House.
Or welcome back, I should say.

186
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:53,364
It feels smaller than I remember.

187
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:56,325
- Where do they have you sitting?
- Right there, second row.

188
00:11:56,409 --> 00:11:59,412
Oh. I would've thought
you wanted first row.

189
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,747
I heard you spit when you talk.

190
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,916
What's the president speaking
about tomorrow?

191
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,918
- You don't waste a minute, do you?
- No.

192
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:07,128
I gotta say, I was surprised

193
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:09,464
that the Telegraph sent you
to cover the White House.

194
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:12,841
- I mean, who leaves the London bureau?
- Ayla was a protégée of mine.

195
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:15,595
I see, so now they
bring in the big guns.

196
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:17,679
Just one gun, but big enough.

197
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:20,099
- Don't get any ideas.
- About what?

198
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:22,435
This is gonna stay around my neck.

199
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:24,604
You can't boot two reporters in a row
from the Telegraph.

200
00:12:24,686 --> 00:12:27,731
- Certainly not two women.
- I have no desire to do that.

201
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,067
It's an honor to work with you.

202
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:31,651
Pulitzer, Peabody.

203
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:33,488
Get yourself a Nobel,
you'll have a trifecta.

204
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:34,905
Oh, you're almost charming.

205
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,698
Kate, I'm not your enemy here.

206
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,785
You punished Ayla for doing good work.

207
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:41,745
She hit hard and you hit back.
Fair enough.

208
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,998
Well, I'm gonna hit twice as hard
as she ever did

209
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,041
because I can
and because someone should.

210
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:50,338
I look forward to it.

211
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:54,049
You're such a terrible liar.
I'll see you bright and early.

212
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:58,179
You got a minute?

213
00:12:58,262 --> 00:12:59,597
Sure.

214
00:13:02,808 --> 00:13:05,478
Here's the draft
for the statement tomorrow.

215
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:07,355
I want it to be perfect.

216
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:09,607
Congress will fire back,
all guns blazing,

217
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,401
and I'm sure Dunbar will make
a meal and a half out of it.

218
00:13:12,485 --> 00:13:16,656
But I gotta say, I feel good.
To be on the offensive.

219
00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:18,866
If I can't scrape the money together
behind the scenes,

220
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:21,410
I'll rob the bank
in broad goddamn daylight.

221
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:25,331
We'll cram America Works down
their throats and watch them choke.

222
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:27,333
Enough tiptoeing.

223
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:30,336
Here.

224
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,637
Oh, these changes are good.

225
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:42,973
It makes me happy to see you excited.

226
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,975
I feel free again.

227
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,230
- I wish I felt the same.
- The resolution?

228
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:52,024
Just some last minute
hand-holding, but...

229
00:13:52,107 --> 00:13:53,401
I think we'll get there.

230
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,944
I have complete confidence in you.

231
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:02,326
- Do you like this room?
- It's fine.

232
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:06,121
You know,
I haven't spent the night here yet.

233
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,334
- Maybe I could--
- My plane leaves at seven.

234
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:12,670
I should probably get some sleep.

235
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,341
You watch the news tomorrow.
Should be fun.

236
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:20,261
- I will.
- Good night.

237
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:20,237
Seventeen years,
I served the Metro Police.

238
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:23,031
I've seen robberies and murders.

239
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:25,117
I've seen the blight of drugs.

240
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,914
I've seen little kids whose only meal
each day was the one they get at school.

241
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,000
You know what's at the root of all that?

242
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,877
Folks don't have jobs!

243
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:39,298
There are 60,000
unemployed people in Washington.

244
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:41,425
It's a disaster.

245
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,470
And it's a disgrace here
in the nation's capital.

246
00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:47,139
So this morning,
at the president's urging,

247
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:52,019
I am declaring a state of emergency
in the District of Columbia.

248
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:55,272
And I am formally requesting
three billion dollars

249
00:15:55,356 --> 00:16:01,028
from FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund
to put people back to work.

250
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:04,198
Motherfucker.

251
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:08,076
Anyone, and I mean anyone,
who registers for work

252
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,206
in the District of Columbia
will be guaranteed a job.

253
00:16:12,289 --> 00:16:14,750
I'm working with my cabinet
to increase workforce

254
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:17,878
devoted to infrastructure,
maintenance and repair.

255
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:21,590
The Defense Department will ramp up
recruitment and civilian employment.

256
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:25,636
And any private sector companies
who hire AmWorks registrants

257
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,473
will get up to $45,000
toward the yearly salary

258
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,642
of each job that they create.

259
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:35,145
Our goal is full employment
within twelve months.

260
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,857
Our hope is that success in Washington

261
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:42,110
will convince Congress
to fund America Works nationwide.

262
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:43,738
Now, I'll take a few questions.

263
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:45,489
Mr. President!

264
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,457
Madam Ambassador. A word, please.

265
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,000
Excuse me.

266
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:04,132
We are withdrawing support
of the peacekeeping resolution.

267
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:07,010
- Why?
- Because Israel is.

268
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:10,639
Palestine is open to the plan,
but without consensus...

269
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:14,101
This came directly from Jerusalem?

270
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:16,771
- Yes, the foreign minister.
- Nothing came from Eliana?

271
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:18,606
No, but I came to speak to her.

272
00:17:21,024 --> 00:17:23,110
I'll speak to her myself.
Thank you, Hasan.

273
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:25,404
Thank you, Ambassador.

274
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,667
Moscow is threatening
to sell arms to Iran.

275
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,878
They always make that threat.

276
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:42,797
The feeling in Jerusalem
is that this resolution

277
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,965
may push them over the edge.
It's not worth the risk.

278
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:47,635
Why didn't you come to me?
The vote's in two hours.

279
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,595
I got the call 30 minutes ago.

280
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:52,389
Russia doesn't want to be humiliated
because we did this without them.

281
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:54,141
You know it's a bluff on their part.

282
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:57,645
The prime minister feels
that this vote is just symbolic.

283
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,897
That the US won't
actually contribute troops.

284
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,066
No, we will absolutely follow
through once it's passed.

285
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,319
The prime minister has his doubts.

286
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,948
I'm sorry, it's out of my hands.

287
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:10,950
Claire?

288
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,621
Ambassadors, I need you
to withdraw the resolution.

289
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:17,247
We lost consensus.

290
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:20,334
I need to postpone the vote
until we get it back.

291
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,547
Secretary Travers is a good example.

292
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:27,508
Homeland Security?

293
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:30,845
- Former secretary, I should say.
- He's done?

294
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:33,013
They haven't announced,
but Steve called me.

295
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:37,058
Said he stood up to the president
on this FEMA nonsense.

296
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:39,770
Homeland Security has jurisdiction
over FEMA now.

297
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:44,399
Right. The president demanded his letter
of resignation right then and there.

298
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:48,195
- This is all off the record.
- Yeah.

299
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:52,449
- Paul's got a big mouth.
- So it's true?

300
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:55,369
- This is off the record?
- Completely.

301
00:18:55,452 --> 00:18:58,121
- Let me call you on my encrypted phone.
- My number is blocked, so--

302
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,541
This is Homeland Security.
I have your number.

303
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:10,300
Incoming call.
Press the pickup bu--

304
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:14,179
- Mr. Secretary.
- It's true. I resigned.

305
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,931
Why are you still in the office?

306
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:18,726
Punching the clock until
the White House wants to go public.

307
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,353
Why wouldn't you go public yourself,
if you're so against the policy?

308
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:23,313
I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

309
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:27,275
I have Landry on background.
I'm writing about the resignation.

310
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,278
And I can't stop you.
But there won't be a quote from me.

311
00:19:32,656 --> 00:19:34,867
Don't let the administration
off the hook.

312
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,411
This an opportunity to speak out.

313
00:19:37,494 --> 00:19:39,329
You don't have the career I've had

314
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:44,251
by criticizing your bosses publicly,
no matter how strongly you feel.

315
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:46,420
Talk to Arnie Silva,
the FEMA Administrator.

316
00:19:46,503 --> 00:19:48,964
He's more disgusted
by all this than I am.

317
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,078
People's lives are in the balance.
And he doesn't care.

318
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:24,959
Our projections
for the next 12 months.

319
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:30,839
We're in a La Niña phase, which means
falling temperatures in the Pacific.

320
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:34,051
We expect at least two
major landfalls this season.

321
00:20:34,134 --> 00:20:38,597
Homes destroyed, billions in damage,
tens of thousands without power.

322
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,182
And that's just hurricanes.
If we get a major earthquake,

323
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:43,184
or flood, or forest fire...

324
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:47,564
It's all in there.

325
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:49,024
Has he asked you to resign?

326
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:51,526
He threatened it.

327
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,071
But I said I'd cooperate.

328
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:56,281
Why?

329
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:59,451
Nobody has more experience.

330
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,703
I couldn't forgive myself if I left.

331
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:03,872
But you just said, if the Relief Fund
is depleted, then--

332
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:05,749
People will suffer.

333
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:11,130
But on my watch, fewer will suffer.

334
00:21:11,212 --> 00:21:13,715
I need a quote, Mr. Silva.

335
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:16,217
I can't do that.

336
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:18,762
People could die,
you have a responsibility.

337
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:22,432
The president has built
a culture of silence and fear.

338
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:23,851
That can end with you.

339
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:29,731
That folder will speak louder
than anything I could say.

340
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:38,115
Two front page bylines
on the same day for Ms. Baldwin?

341
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:40,868
You kicked out a pit bull
and you let in a dragon.

342
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:43,162
I didn't think the Telegraph
would send someone like her.

343
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:44,913
Well, maybe you just didn't think.

344
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:47,166
You wanted me
to implement discipline, sir.

345
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:48,917
To send a message. And so I did.

346
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,920
Well, they've sent back an even
stronger message, haven't they?

347
00:21:52,004 --> 00:21:53,755
I take responsibility for that, sir,

348
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,549
and I will do my best
to keep her in line.

349
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:57,551
Your best?

350
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:59,970
It's their top bureau chief.
She's untouchable.

351
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:02,973
I don't want to pretend that I can
control her 100 percent.

352
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:05,142
- Travers?
- Denied speaking with her,

353
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:08,353
but it must be him. I don't think
anybody else in the cabinet would.

354
00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:10,064
Let's confirm his resignation.

355
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:13,525
No point in keeping it a secret now.
Tell Steve he can vacate his office.

356
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:14,860
And what about Silva?

357
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:18,155
The details on the disaster projections
are very inside baseball.

358
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:20,532
We can't fire him!
If there's a hurricane,

359
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:23,827
he's the only guy that can keep
a disaster from becoming a catastrophe.

360
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:26,496
- And what's Dunbar saying?
- Nothing yet, publicly.

361
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,918
- She's probably letting this play out.
- Letting me dig my own grave.

362
00:22:32,335 --> 00:22:35,005
We have to sell America Works.

363
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:37,382
It should sell itself
once we get people employed.

364
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:39,676
Well, that's the idea,
but we don't stop there.

365
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,138
- Commercials and billboards?
- On whose money?

366
00:22:43,222 --> 00:22:45,264
And even so, we need more than ad-buys.

367
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:49,436
We need...
We need the philosophy behind it.

368
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,148
We need something of substance.
We need something...

369
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:08,080
We need something
that will capture the imagination.

370
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:11,583
- Either of you play Monument Valley?
- What's that?

371
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:13,418
- It's a video game.
- I don't play them, sir.

372
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,254
I sold my Xbox on eBay.
It was too addictive.

373
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:17,672
No, it's not a console game.

374
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:20,968
You both read this and then tell me
that you wouldn't want to play this.

375
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:28,391
I'd say there's nine consultants in the
country who truly know foreign policy.

376
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,060
Me, I'm number one.

377
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:32,187
Me in a coma is number two.

378
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:34,313
But that still leaves seven
who are cheaper.

379
00:23:34,397 --> 00:23:38,068
I value good counsel, and I'm smart
enough to know what I don't know.

380
00:23:38,152 --> 00:23:40,237
What would be your assessment
of us so far?

381
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,530
You're making a big stink
out of this Michael Corrigan thing,

382
00:23:42,614 --> 00:23:43,907
but that's just surface.

383
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:46,451
You have to understand
why Corrigan got arrested.

384
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:48,620
Petrov's appealing
to his traditional base.

385
00:23:48,703 --> 00:23:51,665
No. This is about the Jordan Valley.

386
00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:53,917
I don't follow.

387
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,043
Retaliation.

388
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:57,378
It goes back to the summit
a couple of months ago.

389
00:23:57,462 --> 00:24:01,883
Look, this... is the Jordan Valley.

390
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:06,054
All right, hold on, I'll make it easier.

391
00:24:12,435 --> 00:24:14,353
That's the Valley. Right there.

392
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:17,232
Occupied by Israel since 1967,
it's been a major roadblock

393
00:24:17,316 --> 00:24:19,526
in any peace accord
with the Palestinians.

394
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:22,487
Underwood sends peacekeeping troops,
the Israelis leave,

395
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,282
- the Palestinians are happy.
- It's not that simple.

396
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:28,367
Everyone gets hung up on this
little patch of land ten miles by 40,

397
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:31,955
but you have to look outwards,
past Jordan and Syria, past Iraq.

398
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:37,336
Here... to the Caucasus.
That's Russia's sphere of influence.

399
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:40,255
They don't see the peacekeeping force
as a Middle East issue.

400
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:42,381
They see it as strategic
deployment of US troops

401
00:24:42,465 --> 00:24:44,551
less than a thousand miles
from their southern border.

402
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:47,304
So you're saying Corrigan's a pawn,
a play for leverage?

403
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:49,014
More of a first salvo.

404
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:51,558
Moscow wants to show it's serious
about fighting this resolution.

405
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:53,476
Now, if I had to guess,

406
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,437
Underwood tried to bring Russia
into the mix during the summit.

407
00:24:56,521 --> 00:25:00,025
Get involved early on as partners.
And when Petrov didn't play ball,

408
00:25:00,108 --> 00:25:03,737
Underwood went on the offensive,
which is a huge gamble.

409
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,698
- Tell me how.
- Nobody wants UN troops there.

410
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:09,450
Not the Israelis,
not the Palestinians, not the Arabs.

411
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:12,037
They're playing along
because the US is pressuring them.

412
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,997
But just one little thing
needs to go wrong,

413
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:17,125
and you've got a tinderbox
where everyone's holding matches.

414
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:20,503
So why is he following
this course of action at all?

415
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:22,630
Because he's smart.

416
00:25:22,714 --> 00:25:24,716
- You just said--
- He's being too smart.

417
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,262
If it pays off, hey,
he wins a Nobel Prize. But...

418
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:34,059
if it backfires,
he leaves himself wide open.

419
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:35,894
And that's when you need
to hit him hard.

420
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:39,106
A disastrous foreign policy
that made the world more dangerous.

421
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:41,775
And he had his wife
with zero foreign policy experience

422
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:44,903
- lead the goddamn charge.
- I'd like to bring you aboard, Joe.

423
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:47,406
- When can you start?
- I believe I already did.

424
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:49,574
I'll get the paperwork
over to you later today.

425
00:25:49,657 --> 00:25:51,410
Let me ask, who referred me?

426
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:54,371
- You have quite a reputation.
- Yeah, for being an asshole.

427
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,664
Somebody you respect
must have recommended me highly.

428
00:25:56,748 --> 00:26:00,043
- A former Underwood staffer.
- I never worked with any of his people.

429
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:02,421
Which is one of the reasons
he recommended you.

430
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:03,797
Touché.

431
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:09,010
What is this?

432
00:26:09,094 --> 00:26:11,388
A list of the Russian officials
who will be sanctioned

433
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,681
if you sell a single truckload
of arms to Iran.

434
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:15,976
I didn't even make the top ten.

435
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:18,937
These sanctions can and will escalate.

436
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,855
And then what?

437
00:26:20,939 --> 00:26:23,442
We'd build a coalition
to impose their own sanctions.

438
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:24,901
And then what?

439
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:29,864
Alexi, you know what an economic
crisis that would be for Russia.

440
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:32,159
Like the trade war you waged with China?

441
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:36,121
Except in our case, only three percent
of exports go to the US.

442
00:26:36,204 --> 00:26:38,081
And Europe needs our natural gas.

443
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:41,293
They won't forfeit that over
a few short-range missiles to Iran.

444
00:26:41,376 --> 00:26:44,838
You don't want to challenge us
on the armament of a terrorist state.

445
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:47,174
We'll never be presented
with that problem.

446
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:49,384
You can't assure the Israelis
you'll provide troops.

447
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:52,637
The president doesn't have
the support of either party in Congress.

448
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,640
No troops, no Israel.
No Israel, no consensus.

449
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:58,310
No consensus, no resolution.

450
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:02,730
I will get this resolution passed.

451
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:06,401
Don't underestimate my ability
or desire to do so.

452
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:09,070
I've indulged your
enthusiasm long enough.

453
00:27:09,154 --> 00:27:10,905
You've bit off more
than you can chew, Claire.

454
00:27:10,989 --> 00:27:12,324
Leave this to the professionals

455
00:27:12,407 --> 00:27:15,243
and let your little resolution
die a painless death.

456
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:18,372
The truth is, you have
no business being ambassador

457
00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:20,581
any more than I do being First Lady.

458
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:31,176
That's a very nice dress, by the way.

459
00:27:34,637 --> 00:27:37,098
"She stabbed the floor with a broom.

460
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:39,934
Karaoke every Wednesday.

461
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:44,481
Some tone-deaf drunk girl
mutilating Britney Spears.

462
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:47,401
She knew they couldn't hear
the broom in the bar below.

463
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:51,570
But we all need a ritual,
and this was hers.

464
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:53,740
Three short thrusts, wood on wood,

465
00:27:53,823 --> 00:27:57,452
a hollow sound
which accomplished nothing.

466
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:59,329
David would be home soon.

467
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:02,749
'It's too hot,' he'd say.
She opened the window.

468
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:07,045
The music was so loud,
she couldn't ignore it."

469
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:19,849
Here.

470
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:24,229
Aren't you gonna buy the new one?

471
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:26,814
I will, on my Kindle.
But will you please sign this?

472
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:31,570
- Who should I make it out to?
- Lesley. L-E-S-L-E-Y.

473
00:28:32,404 --> 00:28:34,739
Scorpio totally changed my life.

474
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:38,452
The energy and the anger...
It's my favorite book of yours.

475
00:28:38,535 --> 00:28:40,579
Probably my favorite book, period.

476
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,791
- Make sure you read the new one.
- Yes.

477
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:50,088
Who should I make it out to?

478
00:28:57,887 --> 00:29:00,515
It's a perversion of the Stafford Act
and you know it.

479
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,726
It's a reading of the Stafford Act.
We read it differently.

480
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,647
You can't just raid funds that Congress
appropriated for a specific use,

481
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:10,066
- then use them however you want.
- Clearly, I can.

482
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,486
This is a direct challenge
to Congress, Mr. President.

483
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:15,113
Bob and I have agreed.
Both parties will fight you on this.

484
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:18,116
Well, at least I'm
cultivating bipartisanship.

485
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:22,078
Gentlemen, I don't want to do this,
but what choice have you left me?

486
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,997
Our branch is here to check yours.

487
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,416
If we didn't feel America Works
warranted taxpayer money,

488
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,918
- then it's not fit to be law.
- Now, look.

489
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:31,421
This is the first time
that the leaders of both parties

490
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:32,964
have met with me in one room,

491
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,550
and not because I didn't invite you,
because you declined.

492
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:38,595
So, now that we're here,
let's make the most of it.

493
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:40,180
I'm willing to walk back on FEMA

494
00:29:40,263 --> 00:29:42,474
if we can discuss
putting AmWorks on the floor.

495
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:45,101
- You bullied us on the Education Bill.
- And the government freeze.

496
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:46,645
It's not gonna work this time.

497
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:49,063
You watch it work
and then tell me it didn't.

498
00:29:49,147 --> 00:29:52,108
We're drafting a law,
saying this use of the DRF is illegal.

499
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:53,943
And who's going to enforce that law?

500
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:56,321
We were ready to impeach one president.

501
00:29:56,404 --> 00:29:58,823
We'll do the same with you if necessary.

502
00:29:58,906 --> 00:30:03,119
And put Donald Blythe in this office?
You know he's not up for the job.

503
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:05,330
Congress would get killed
for malpractice.

504
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:07,666
As crooked as you may think I am,

505
00:30:07,748 --> 00:30:10,544
you know I can handle the pressure,
and you know Donald can't.

506
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:13,880
So pass your law, I'll veto it.
And when you overrule me in the Senate,

507
00:30:13,963 --> 00:30:15,965
we'll let the third branch decide.

508
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:18,593
Don't declare war on Congress,
Mr. President.

509
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:21,638
Not on Congress.
I'm declaring war on atrophy.

510
00:30:21,721 --> 00:30:24,432
But these days,
who could tell the difference?

511
00:30:45,537 --> 00:30:48,248
Oh! Oh...

512
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:08,560
Oh...

513
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:25,702
- So how about this?
- Hm?

514
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:30,123
I'll order a pizza.

515
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:32,792
When it gets here,
I bring it into this room...

516
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,588
with a paper towel
draped over my arm.

517
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:40,300
Voilà. Just like... room service.

518
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:42,677
You don't let your kids eat pizza.

519
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:45,680
Well, because I've seen
what it does to a carotid artery.

520
00:31:46,598 --> 00:31:49,309
- And you're not my kids.
- Mm...

521
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,355
Do you think they like me?

522
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:59,402
They adore you.

523
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,239
Matt asked if you could teach him
how to drive.

524
00:32:03,323 --> 00:32:04,532
- Really?
- Yeah.

525
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:06,326
He says you'd be less judgmental.

526
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,584
Do you want to get married?

527
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:20,590
To you, or in general?

528
00:32:23,635 --> 00:32:25,637
I'm serious.

529
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,768
So where'd this come from?

530
00:32:31,851 --> 00:32:34,228
- We've talked about it.
- Hm...

531
00:32:34,312 --> 00:32:36,773
We say "I love you."

532
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,943
I want a husband.
You want a wife.

533
00:32:42,737 --> 00:32:45,865
This works, the two of us,
don't you think?

534
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:51,120
- It's very romantic.
- Aren't we past romance?

535
00:32:51,204 --> 00:32:52,997
I bought you a ring.

536
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,794
Why didn't you say anything?

537
00:32:57,877 --> 00:33:00,588
It's the element of surprise.

538
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,757
That's kind of the point, isn't it?

539
00:33:03,758 --> 00:33:06,511
It's in my glove compartment.
I can go get it if you want.

540
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:10,973
No, I want you to order the pizza.

541
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:15,395
We can do the whole ring thing tomorrow.

542
00:33:32,787 --> 00:33:34,873
- Hey.
- Hey.

543
00:33:34,955 --> 00:33:37,041
When did you get in?

544
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:39,794
- Couple of hours ago.
- Well, come and sit down.

545
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:43,214
I feel like I haven't seen you for what,
has it been three days?

546
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:44,883
Four, I think.

547
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:47,594
It's just all been a big blur.

548
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:48,969
Mm. Same in New York.

549
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:53,140
- Any luck?
- They're like a broken record, Francis.

550
00:33:53,224 --> 00:33:55,560
Do I need to call the prime minister?

551
00:33:55,643 --> 00:33:58,229
Oh, I think it's gonna take more
than a phone call.

552
00:33:58,312 --> 00:34:01,566
- Tell me.
- That's not why I'm here, actually.

553
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:06,195
Hang on, hang on.

554
00:34:07,321 --> 00:34:10,742
So much has been going on in the past
few months, we hardly have time to talk.

555
00:34:10,825 --> 00:34:12,660
Here, use this.

556
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:18,416
I feel bad about the other night
when you wanted to sleep in my bed.

557
00:34:18,499 --> 00:34:20,627
Oh, that. You shouldn't.

558
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,629
I just--

559
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:24,547
I don't know why
I started sleeping in there.

560
00:34:24,631 --> 00:34:28,008
Well, if I remember correctly,
you had a cold.

561
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:30,511
But why I stayed.

562
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,555
You don't have to explain.

563
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:37,811
I want you to know that I love you.
It has nothing to do with that.

564
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:40,062
I love you... as much as ever.

565
00:34:43,316 --> 00:34:45,318
Not another word.

566
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:51,866
Let's finish talking about Israel
in the morning.

567
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:56,162
You said more than a phone call?

568
00:34:58,623 --> 00:35:02,126
They need it in stone, Francis,
that we'll contribute troops.

569
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:04,963
- An executive order.
- Congress won't be happy.

570
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:06,798
Well, they're already not happy.

571
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:09,676
I spat in one eye,
I might as well spit in the other.

572
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,093
Consider it done.

573
00:35:18,977 --> 00:35:21,228
Thank you.
Thank you for your support.

574
00:35:21,312 --> 00:35:23,690
Thank you so much. Thank you.

575
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:25,525
Thank you. Oh, sure.

576
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:33,491
Did you get it?

577
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:35,535
Thank you. Thank you so much.

578
00:35:35,618 --> 00:35:38,120
Thank you.
Thank you for your support.

579
00:35:38,204 --> 00:35:41,081
- Thank you, sir.
- I liked your speech, Ms. Dunbar.

580
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:43,960
- And I've heard more than a few.
- I appreciate you saying that, sir.

581
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:45,670
I know Iowans aren't easily impressed.

582
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:47,672
What you said about integrity?

583
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:50,550
Well, if you can bring that
to Washington, I'll caucus for you.

584
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,886
One supporter at a time.
That's how we'll win this.

585
00:35:52,969 --> 00:35:56,931
And that young man? I feel for him.
He's an inspiring individual.

586
00:35:57,015 --> 00:35:58,850
John, there's someone
I want you to meet.

587
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:00,434
- Your name, sir?
- Clive Reynolds.

588
00:36:00,518 --> 00:36:03,813
- Mr. Reynolds, nice to meet you.
- I'm praying for your husband.

589
00:36:03,897 --> 00:36:06,900
- It's awful he's still stuck there.
- Stamper's in the cafeteria.

590
00:36:06,983 --> 00:36:09,109
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.
Thank you.

591
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:11,738
Thank you for your support.
Thank you for coming out.

592
00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:25,376
You could've just called.

593
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:28,462
I hate July Fourth in DC.

594
00:36:28,546 --> 00:36:30,297
Plus, I wanted to see you in action.

595
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:32,174
What'd you think?

596
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:34,301
I need her to leave.

597
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:41,893
I'll meet you at the car.

598
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:45,145
- Heather--
- Cynthia.

599
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:08,669
Read that.

600
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:22,516
Mrs. Underwood asked me to destroy it.

601
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,310
- I didn't.
- You should have.

602
00:37:24,393 --> 00:37:26,353
She lied on national television.

603
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:28,731
I am not running that sort of campaign.

604
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:33,235
But it's good to know it's available.

605
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:38,074
I would never do that to another woman,
and neither would Cynthia.

606
00:37:38,157 --> 00:37:41,577
Hm. Cynthia was a good choice
for your manager.

607
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:44,330
She'll run a top-notch operation.

608
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:46,332
But you need someone
who's willing to do the things

609
00:37:46,415 --> 00:37:48,208
that people like her won't do.

610
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:50,920
When you asked me for a job,

611
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:54,048
you said you wanted
to turn over a new leaf.

612
00:37:54,132 --> 00:37:57,343
I have a certain skill set,
Ms. Dunbar.

613
00:37:57,426 --> 00:38:01,639
For me, turning over a new leaf
is using my skills for the right reasons.

614
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:03,599
Like putting you in office.

615
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:07,186
One-fifty.
One point on the ad-buy.

616
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:11,190
No points.

617
00:38:11,273 --> 00:38:15,486
But I'll do a hundred thousand win bonus
if we get the nomination.

618
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,669
I hope I came over here
for some good news.

619
00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:36,883
I'm in. You can tell the president.

620
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:38,759
August 19th.

621
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:40,761
We wanted you to announce
a lot earlier than that.

622
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:44,223
No, not the announcement. This.

623
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:49,812
Cardiology's good money.

624
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:53,191
Aren't you gonna say congrats?

625
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,776
I've never seen you be this girly.

626
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,612
It's a fucking diamond.
I'm allowed to be a little girly.

627
00:38:58,696 --> 00:39:01,448
Congratulations.
I'm happy for you both.

628
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:02,992
Are you?

629
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:09,707
Sorry. That wasn't fair.

630
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,919
Maybe we should talk about dates
for announcing the campaign.

631
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:16,005
Yeah, I have a few ideas.
Let me pull up my calendar.

632
00:39:18,216 --> 00:39:19,842
Um...

633
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:23,804
Week after next seems
to be the best option.

634
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:25,139
You have plans tonight?

635
00:39:26,682 --> 00:39:28,184
For the fireworks?

636
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:31,729
Alan and I are taking his kids.

637
00:39:32,897 --> 00:39:34,774
Right. Makes sense.

638
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:42,364
You were saying,
about a week after next?

639
00:39:59,173 --> 00:40:02,342
- The Ambassador's inside.
- You want me to go in there?

640
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:05,972
She's just putting on makeup.

641
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:07,890
I can wait until she comes out.

642
00:40:07,974 --> 00:40:10,893
She's going straight to her plane.
If you don't mind.

643
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:18,442
Alexi.

644
00:40:25,908 --> 00:40:28,995
The day got away from me,
so I have to head down to DC

645
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:31,330
for the July Fourth celebration.

646
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:34,167
You may consider me
an ambassador from the men's room.

647
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:37,962
Don't make me laugh.
I'll have to start over.

648
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:43,968
- Good?
- Quite.

649
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:46,804
Alexi, I think we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

650
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:49,389
We need to find a better way
to work together.

651
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:51,851
You're letting go of the resolution?

652
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:56,189
- Eyes?
- Perfect.

653
00:40:56,272 --> 00:40:58,482
It's always nice
to have a man's opinion.

654
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:01,027
You were right, by the way.

655
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,529
Israel won't back us
unless we commit troops.

656
00:41:03,612 --> 00:41:07,033
You called my bluff, Alexi,
and I shouldn't have insulted you

657
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:09,702
- with one in the first place.
- I'll be outside when you finish.

658
00:41:09,785 --> 00:41:12,454
The president signed
an Executive Order this morning.

659
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:16,959
Five thousand US military reassigned

660
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:19,962
to permanent standby
for UN Peacekeeping operations.

661
00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:21,964
Jerusalem has been informed.

662
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:24,175
Your husband doesn't have
that kind of authority.

663
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:27,011
It's occupied territory.
He's not deploying on sovereign land.

664
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:32,350
So, as Commander in Chief,
he doesn't need Congressional approval.

665
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:36,770
Israel's back on board again, Alexi,
so the moment you sell arms to Iran,

666
00:41:36,854 --> 00:41:39,940
we will shoot the planes out of the sky,
the trucks off the road,

667
00:41:40,024 --> 00:41:41,859
and the ships out of the water.

668
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:47,198
Now... maybe you'd be able
to afford sanctions...

669
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:51,410
...but you sure as hell
can't afford a war.

670
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:54,538
Come back to the table.
Engage us in good faith.

671
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:56,332
Or the resolution goes
to a vote next week.

672
00:41:56,415 --> 00:41:59,043
I have always been willing to talk.

673
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:03,089
Not you and I.
President to president.

674
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:06,050
Oh, and we need Michael Corrigan
released, also.

675
00:42:09,762 --> 00:42:11,889
I'll communicate your message to Moscow.

676
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:14,308
Please.
Hand me a towel, would you?

677
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,608
What a gentleman.

678
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:36,205
You ever been to the White House before?

679
00:42:36,289 --> 00:42:38,457
When I won the National Book Award.

680
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,210
- Nancy was a fan.
- I'm surprised.

681
00:42:41,294 --> 00:42:44,297
That story doesn't exactly
revere family values.

682
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,923
She's got the astrologer in her.

683
00:42:46,006 --> 00:42:48,175
I think she liked the title
more than anything.

684
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:50,303
Scorpio was a very good book.

685
00:42:50,386 --> 00:42:53,597
- Still pays the rent.
- Have a seat.

686
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,849
Why am I here, Mr. President?

687
00:42:55,933 --> 00:42:58,227
Remy briefed you.

688
00:42:58,311 --> 00:43:01,147
He said you needed a book.
He didn't say about what.

689
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:04,858
America Works.
Not just the policy, but the origins.

690
00:43:04,942 --> 00:43:07,653
How a boy grew up
in a dirt-poor shithole

691
00:43:07,736 --> 00:43:09,947
and climbed his way out
through hard work.

692
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:13,700
A story of dignity.
The pride that comes with one's labor.

693
00:43:13,784 --> 00:43:16,829
- Propaganda.
- You could call it that.

694
00:43:16,912 --> 00:43:20,166
This sort of thing...
it's not in my wheelhouse.

695
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:22,918
You need a salesman, not a novelist.

696
00:43:24,295 --> 00:43:28,341
"Whoever you are,
whoever you think you are,

697
00:43:28,424 --> 00:43:32,678
believe that you're
also a silent princess.

698
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:35,306
Your name is Ida.

699
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:38,684
Your journey is one
through a forgotten landscape

700
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:42,062
of twisting staircases
and morphing castles,

701
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:46,608
atop floating stones
defiantly crossing an angry sea,

702
00:43:46,692 --> 00:43:50,946
within dimly-lit caverns
cobwebbed with ruins

703
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,075
M.C. Escher could
only grasp at in a dream state."

704
00:43:55,159 --> 00:43:57,536
You read my video game reviews?

705
00:43:57,619 --> 00:44:00,998
I tend to play shoot-'em-ups.
The indie games don't really interest me.

706
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:05,669
I need adrenaline and action.
But when I read this, I had to try it.

707
00:44:05,752 --> 00:44:09,715
If you can convince me to be a silent
princess with just a hundred words,

708
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:12,718
imagine how many millions
you can convince with this book.

709
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,012
You are a salesman, Thomas.

710
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:18,516
I wasn't trying to sell anything.
Just describe my experience.

711
00:44:18,598 --> 00:44:20,559
That's exactly what I want you to do
with my story.

712
00:44:20,642 --> 00:44:23,729
No sales pitch,
just your honest curiosity.

713
00:44:23,812 --> 00:44:27,441
Besides, these kinds of books
are always so boring, so safe.

714
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:31,445
I want something different,
something... unique.

715
00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:33,655
Your voice.

716
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,283
I don't even know if I believe
in your program.

717
00:44:37,451 --> 00:44:39,370
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

718
00:45:22,704 --> 00:45:25,207
You build it and they come.

719
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:29,211
Today, the Washington Mall
is the real Field of Dreams.

720
00:45:29,295 --> 00:45:32,881
Three thousand people have registered
since we set up shop this morning.

721
00:45:32,965 --> 00:45:35,468
Now that's what I call
a Fourth of July party!

722
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:39,054
And we're gonna keep the party going
'round the clock, 24/7,

723
00:45:39,138 --> 00:45:42,600
till everyone in DC who wants a job

724
00:45:42,682 --> 00:45:45,769
can make their way
down here and sign up.

725
00:45:52,526 --> 00:45:53,986
Have a look.

726
00:45:56,447 --> 00:46:00,618
- Do you see that line of people?
- The AmWorks tent.

727
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,412
It stretches from there all the way
to the Lincoln Memorial.

728
00:46:03,496 --> 00:46:05,914
They started lining up before sunrise.

729
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,750
It's really something.

730
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:11,378
Thomas, at best,
I'm going to be a footnote in history

731
00:46:11,462 --> 00:46:13,922
if I can't help those people.
At worst, I'll be a joke.

732
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:15,633
I am those people.

733
00:46:15,715 --> 00:46:18,385
I want you to tell that story.

734
00:46:18,469 --> 00:46:20,513
What do you say?

735
00:46:20,596 --> 00:46:23,641
- I don't know.
- What's your gut say?

736
00:46:23,723 --> 00:46:27,727
That you don't add up,
and I'm intrigued.

737
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:29,896
- But not sold.
- Not yet.

738
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,982
Well, I'll pay you well,
and at the very least,

739
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:34,401
this sort of access
is worth its weight in gold, isn't it?

740
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:35,611
Sir, the First Lady's back.

741
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:38,280
I have to go give my Fourth of July
speech before the fireworks.

742
00:46:38,364 --> 00:46:40,533
- How quickly would you need the book?
- By January.

743
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:42,951
I've never written anything
in less than a year.

744
00:46:43,035 --> 00:46:46,205
Well, you don't strike me as someone
who shies away from a challenge.

745
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:49,916
I'd need to be able to write it
the way I want to write it.

746
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,086
Absolutely. Look, take your time.
Enjoy the view.

747
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:55,005
Meechum will show you out
when you're done.

748
00:46:55,088 --> 00:46:58,800
And I promise, if you say yes,
you won't regret it.

749
00:47:01,178 --> 00:47:04,473
No writer worth his salt
can resist a good story,

750
00:47:04,557 --> 00:47:08,644
just as no politician can resist
making promises he can't keep.

751
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:20,155
Viktor, we'd be honored
to accept the invitation.

752
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:23,200
Yes, I agree,
there's much to discuss.

753
00:47:23,283 --> 00:47:26,036
I'll have my office reach out
to the Kremlin.

754
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,121
We'll find dates
that work for both of us.

755
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:31,542
Thank you.

756
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:34,336
Well, you should get some sleep.
It's late over there.

757
00:47:35,546 --> 00:47:37,172
Good night.

758
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:39,966
Hold off on the vote?

759
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,429
Until we sit down.
But we keep it in our back pocket.

760
00:47:43,512 --> 00:47:45,055
Michael Corrigan?

761
00:47:45,138 --> 00:47:47,849
They're going to release him
when we visit.

762
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:50,227
You made a miracle happen.

763
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,811
We did.

764
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:03,574
...each unique citizen
contributes to our future.

765
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:05,200
Can you turn that up?

766
00:48:05,284 --> 00:48:07,827
Our forefathers,
when they declared independence,

767
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:10,914
understood the power
of the individual,

768
00:48:10,997 --> 00:48:13,791
the value of self-determination.

769
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,002
They freed us from tyranny.

770
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:17,713
- They proved...
- He is a tyrant.

771
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,632
I don't know,
there's a lot of people out there.

772
00:48:19,715 --> 00:48:21,007
He might be onto something.

773
00:48:21,091 --> 00:48:23,302
Executive Order for UN troops?
He's out of control.

774
00:48:23,385 --> 00:48:25,845
At least he's doing something.
Walker didn't do shit.

775
00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:28,599
I think we replaced a dud
with an atom bomb.

776
00:48:28,682 --> 00:48:31,685
They had to fight
to secure their freedom.

777
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:34,812
And now we have to fight to maintain it.

778
00:48:34,896 --> 00:48:37,107
The freedom to work.

779
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,859
The freedom to live with dignity.

780
00:48:39,943 --> 00:48:42,321
The freedom to hope.

781
00:48:42,404 --> 00:48:46,824
Thank you, and God bless
the United States of America.
