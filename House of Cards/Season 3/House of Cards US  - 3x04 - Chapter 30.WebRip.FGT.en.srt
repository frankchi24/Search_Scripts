2
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:52,188
Deference to the executive
cannot possibly justify

3
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:57,152
the injuries to Mr. Mahmoud
or the death of his family members.

4
00:01:57,235 --> 00:02:01,948
If you do not say that this is wrong,
that this is unconstitutional,

5
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:06,828
there is nothing to prevent this sort
of senseless tragedy from happening again.

6
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:10,331
We ask for nothing more
than reform and oversight.

7
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:12,583
Your ruling is a crucial first step.

8
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,752
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Katyal.

9
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:16,254
Ms. Dunbar.

10
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,929
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court,

11
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:28,808
the security of American citizens
is the reason our drone program

12
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,060
and other covert operations exist.

13
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:34,438
But that security
often comes with a cost.

14
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:38,026
At this very moment,
the president is at Arlington Cemetery,

15
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,444
laying to rest three Navy SEALs

16
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:44,324
who perished on a mountainside
in Afghanistan.

17
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:46,909
They gave their lives to save others.

18
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:10,058
And God said to Abraham,
"Take your son,

19
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:13,811
your only son, whom you love,
Isaac, and sacrifice him."

20
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:16,647
Abraham was willing.

21
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:22,945
But when he raised his knife
above Isaac on the altar,

22
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:24,697
God stopped him.

23
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,701
For Abraham had proven
his devotion to God.

24
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:33,664
Then God, to prove his devotion to us,

25
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:36,167
made his own sacrifice.

26
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:41,630
"For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only Son."

27
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:45,968
Devotion. Sacrifice.

28
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:47,303
Love.

29
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:50,681
This is what the Lord teaches us.

30
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:54,977
And what these young men
have exemplified.

31
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,146
We shall forever honor them.

32
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:03,027
And in heaven,
they will have eternal life.

33
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,821
Amen.

34
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:07,656
Ready, pull.

35
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:16,457
As you are aware, we have
invoked the State secrets privilege

36
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,542
during our request for dismissal.

37
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:23,131
But I have authority from the president
to share some of the classified brief

38
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:25,800
in order to reinforce
the government's argument.

39
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:29,137
Are you certain you want to do that,
Ms. Dunbar?

40
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,390
I am, Mr. Chief Justice.
And so is the president.

41
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35,893
So the government is publicly
admitting responsibility for the strike?

42
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:37,312
It is, Your Honor.

43
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:41,690
The terrorist successfully targeted
was Zuri Aziz.

44
00:04:41,774 --> 00:04:44,444
He routinely used civilians
as human shields.

45
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:47,905
Mr. Mahmoud's family did not know
Aziz was in the same building.

46
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:51,533
The drone strike is responsible
for their deaths.

47
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:56,872
Mr. Mahmoud has suffered
a terrible injury and loss.

48
00:04:56,956 --> 00:05:01,502
While the government's action is tragic,
it wasn't unlawful.

49
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:05,340
It was legal, it was necessary,
and it was right.

50
00:05:05,423 --> 00:05:07,800
Heather Dunbar?
She's never run for office.

51
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:10,803
You don't become Solicitor General
without being politically savvy.

52
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,972
It takes more than savvy
to be elected president.

53
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:16,225
Don't forget, she has a national profile
after the Walker investigation.

54
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,269
Truth and justice personified.

55
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:20,562
If the leadership wants
to redefine the party, she's--

56
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:23,524
No one with this little
experience has ever been a real contender

57
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:25,776
since Ross Perot,
and at least he had the money.

58
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,280
So does she.
Her family owns Dunbar Armored Cars.

59
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,743
She could finance her entire campaign
if she needed to.

60
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:36,871
But what prevents the abuse of power?

61
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:40,208
The executive can't legislate,
can't receive appropriations,

62
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:42,084
can't sentence people to imprisonment.

63
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:44,086
All of these depend
on the other branches,

64
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,297
which keeps executive power in check.

65
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:48,548
But we know for a fact that,
in emergencies,

66
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:51,052
the executive will contemplate actions

67
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,804
that do not have clear
legislative authority

68
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:57,475
and might be constitutionally dubious.

69
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,643
Including--

70
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:10,988
Are you asking about drone strikes,
Your Honor?

71
00:06:11,072 --> 00:06:12,865
Yes. Drone strikes.

72
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:16,160
The fear of an out-of-control
executive is exaggerated.

73
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:19,747
The president has strong electoral
and other political incentives

74
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,416
to act in the public interest.

75
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:24,584
You yourself have investigated
the White House for abuse of power.

76
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,295
It forced a president to resign.

77
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,174
Now you maintain that, uh, we should
give our president a wide berth?

78
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:33,844
I am not here to defend any one person,

79
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:37,223
but rather the office
of the presidency itself.

80
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:41,060
We must hold everyone
in government accountable to the law.

81
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:45,398
But we must not manufacture
our interpretation of the law

82
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:49,026
to erode constitutional authority.

83
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,156
We can prosecute presidents,
but not the presidency.

84
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,741
We have to assume this is happening.

85
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,701
We need to end her campaign
before it begins.

86
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,870
She's clean.
Walker vetted her for Solicitor General,

87
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:01,747
then again when he made her
special prosecutor.

88
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,666
That's one of the things
that makes her so attractive.

89
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,502
- Thank you, Jackie.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:12,258
Well, if we can't knock her out,
we have to figure out another way.

91
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:32,153
- It's something, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

92
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,657
Traditionally,
the United States has not supported

93
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,201
military action in the Middle East.

94
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:42,497
But a neutral UN peacekeeping force
in the Jordan Valley

95
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,793
is an essential first step
to sustainable, long-term peace.

96
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:50,338
The United States will vote "yes."

97
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,964
Thank you, Mr. President.

98
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,049
I give the floor
to the representative

99
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,926
of the Russian Federation.

100
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:00,515
Russia is also committed
to stability in the region.

101
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,185
But inserting the UN
into such a complicated situation

102
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:07,355
could irrevocably damage
the hopes of real peace.

103
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:10,858
I strongly encourage my colleagues
to not support this resolution.

104
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,860
Thank you, Mr. President.

105
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:17,532
With no further requests to speak,
I put the draft resolution to a vote.

106
00:08:17,615 --> 00:08:19,534
All those in favor?

107
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:23,496
Those against?

108
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:27,166
Those abstaining?

109
00:08:29,377 --> 00:08:34,715
The vote is 13 in favor,
one against, one abstention.

110
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,758
The draft resolution does not pass

111
00:08:36,842 --> 00:08:41,847
due to the "no" vote by a permanent member
of the Security Council.

112
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:49,813
We hoped that
Russia would change their mind

113
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,691
but their veto doesn't surprise me.

114
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:56,404
So we need your support
to bypass the Security Council.

115
00:08:56,487 --> 00:09:00,575
We don't want to
undermine the veto of permanent members.

116
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:05,204
We will not establish
a dangerous precedent.

117
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:09,584
The General Assembly can't override
the veto without a majority.

118
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:11,919
Do you still have the support of Israel?

119
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:15,339
I would not call you
if this was not the case.

120
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:20,261
Then as long as Israel agrees, we agree.

121
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:23,431
Wonderful. Thank you, Ambassador.

122
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:28,728
I'll let you know when we decide
to submit it to a vote.

123
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:37,152
Ileana, France is in.

124
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:40,197
I need to be certain
Israel will stand firm.

125
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:49,790
Israel will never maintain
its commitment.

126
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:54,128
Israel wants what the rest of the world
wants, sustainable security.

127
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:57,423
Trust me on this, I've dealt with
Jerusalem for many years at the UN.

128
00:09:57,506 --> 00:10:00,092
The moment it gets difficult,
they'll turn their back on you.

129
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:02,928
- And it will get difficult.
- You're right.

130
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:05,180
I can't predict how they will act
down the road,

131
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,808
but I do know they will vote
for this resolution.

132
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,518
We'll see.

133
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:11,979
Going around the Security Council
is a radical move.

134
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,607
It's not radical, it's justified.

135
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,818
You dust off some 60-year-old
precedent and think you're justified?

136
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:20,279
The Uniting for Peace resolution
was used to start a war.

137
00:10:20,362 --> 00:10:22,072
To end North Korea's aggression.

138
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,366
Semantics.

139
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,454
Ninety-three nations on board already,
including Israel, that's not semantics.

140
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:31,081
Claire, I'm getting a lot of pressure
from the Kremlin.

141
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,334
Petrov doesn't want this
to go to the General Assembly.

142
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:35,836
Give me a little more time
to work on him.

143
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:48,474
We've given you a month.
We're moving forward.

144
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:59,652
- Yes?
- Ms. Dunbar is here.

145
00:10:59,735 --> 00:11:01,320
Send her in.

146
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,331
- Heather.
- Mr. President.

147
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:15,668
I listened to the audio of your defense
this morning. It was outstanding.

148
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,253
You were right about making
the emotional argument.

149
00:11:18,337 --> 00:11:21,549
I think it will help the country heal.
Please, have a seat.

150
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,559
I'm also going to meet later tonight
with Mr. Mahmoud privately.

151
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:35,604
- To personally apologize.
- That's a compassionate thing to do.

152
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:41,485
When I listened to your argument,
I also heard something else.

153
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:45,947
There was a moment when Justice Jacobs
was asking you about drone strikes.

154
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:47,533
Yeah, I remember.

155
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:52,287
And he paused...
for quite a long time.

156
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:56,291
I think...
he just lost his train of thought.

157
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,419
Well...

158
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,260
What I'm about to tell you
has to remain between us.

159
00:12:06,343 --> 00:12:08,637
Of course.

160
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:11,682
Justice Jacobs has Alzheimer's.

161
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:14,560
He came to me a few months ago
to tell me.

162
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:17,521
Now, it's in the early stages,
so you wouldn't even notice

163
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,690
unless you know what to look for.

164
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,650
He wants to remain on the court?

165
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:24,111
Well, that's what I want to discuss.

166
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:25,987
He wanted to retire.

167
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:28,574
I asked him to hold on
just a little while longer,

168
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:32,286
until I could find a suitable
replacement and now I have.

169
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:35,790
And I want that replacement...
to be you.

170
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,294
What do you think?

171
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:47,092
I'm... humbled, sir.

172
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:51,305
And... honestly surprised
that you'd consider me.

173
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:54,391
- Why is that?
- Given our history.

174
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:57,269
When I said that was water
under the bridge, I meant it.

175
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:59,521
You have the finest legal mind
in this country,

176
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:01,732
a deep understanding
of the Constitution,

177
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:04,318
and the Republicans wouldn't dare
block your nomination.

178
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:07,279
After all, you prosecuted
a Democratic president.

179
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:09,698
You're too good to be Solicitor General.

180
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:13,993
Let's make sure you have a job for life.

181
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:17,331
I appreciate you saying that, sir.

182
00:13:17,414 --> 00:13:19,541
I'm sorry.

183
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,543
This is a lot to process.

184
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,796
It's important we do this
before the election.

185
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,923
We could end up
with a Republican president.

186
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,676
And I don't want
to suggest your name to Jacobs

187
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,761
unless you truly want the position.

188
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:34,682
So... I need to know now.

189
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:40,395
Yes. It would be a great honor.

190
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,690
Good. Congratulations.

191
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:44,859
You speak to your family.
I'll speak to Jacobs.

192
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,777
Thank you, Mr. President.

193
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:29,778
- Did you see this?
- Hm? See what?

194
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:32,280
I just got an alert.

195
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:35,034
I don't know.
I haven't, uh... seen Jim in a while.

196
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:39,246
That's weird.

197
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:50,340
I want to offer you my sincerest regret.

198
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:53,677
And I hope that you
will accept my apology.

199
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:55,596
I'm sorry, but I can't.

200
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,348
I know it should have come sooner.

201
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,392
There needs to be more oversight.

202
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,019
Well, there is congressional oversight.

203
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:05,105
We have a rigorous system
to prevent collateral damage.

204
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:07,649
Civilians are listed as "other militants."

205
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:11,111
But the government offers
no evidence that's true.

206
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:13,906
It definitely wasn't in my case.

207
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:16,658
How rigorous can your process be?

208
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:21,455
The numbers of non-combatants
who are being killed by drone strikes

209
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:24,499
- is lower than it's ever been.
- Those numbers are false.

210
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,003
One civilian killed in 2010?
That has to be wrong.

211
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:31,632
Look, I don't think the Pentagon
is being honest about--

212
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:37,846
Are you okay?

213
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:43,018
- I'll get the doctor up here.
- Don't do that. It'll pass.

214
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:46,271
Phantom pain.

215
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:57,658
You know what I dreamed of
when I came here?

216
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:00,243
Choking you with my bare hands.

217
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:14,925
Mr. Mahmoud, you may hate me.

218
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:17,678
You may hate the office I hold.

219
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:20,221
But here's the reality:

220
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:25,310
I must make decisions every day
that I hope are just.

221
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:28,605
I don't know right
from wrong all the time.

222
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:30,482
I wish I did.

223
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:34,695
But what I can't be is indecisive.

224
00:16:34,778 --> 00:16:39,741
It says in the Qur'an:
"The taking of one innocent life

225
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:42,452
is like the taking of all mankind."

226
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:48,000
It also says that
"the saving of one life

227
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,878
is like the saving of all mankind."

228
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,967
You didn't ask me here to apologize.

229
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,594
You asked me here to forgive you.

230
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,515
I didn't order the strike that--

231
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:07,477
I won't forgive you, Mr. President.

232
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:10,564
I don't want to make it any easier
for you to sleep at night.

233
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:14,026
And knowing a few lines of the Qur'an
does not absolve you.

234
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:22,283
I have a duty to this nation,
Mr. Mahmoud.

235
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:23,577
I swore an oath.

236
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,581
There's a fine line
between duty and murder.

237
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:32,794
Only you have the power
to stop what happened to me.

238
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:38,175
The next time you wield it...
I hope you'll think twice.

239
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:41,220
Yes, of course. Meechum!

240
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:45,057
- Yes, sir?
- You show Mr. Mahmoud out.

241
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:53,065
Two months of random sampling
across the country.

242
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:55,901
Less than a tenth of a percent
of all incoming data.

243
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:56,985
Why so little?

244
00:17:57,069 --> 00:17:58,862
You have any idea
how many cameras we monitor?

245
00:17:58,946 --> 00:18:01,156
The CPU core quota
of every mainframe in Washington

246
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,741
couldn't handle all that data.

247
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:05,244
I tried doubling the sample range
and it set off alarms.

248
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,579
I came this fucking close
to getting caught.

249
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:10,373
Okay, we just need
to narrow the search, man.

250
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:13,794
- It's too much ground to cover.
- How?

251
00:18:13,877 --> 00:18:17,547
I need more information on Rachel.

252
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:19,925
Favorite books, fuckin' movies.

253
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:22,302
- Anything.
- I don't know.

254
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,263
Come on.
Did she ever talk about going anywhere?

255
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:27,641
- Traveling to some place?
- No. Traveling wasn't an option.

256
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,102
I need more, man.

257
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:35,356
- What about the other girl? Lisa.
- I'm reading her e-mails.

258
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,818
I'm tracking her phone.
There's nothing there.

259
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:41,696
We should get close to her, though.
We should talk to her.

260
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,698
- Extract something.
- She might recognize me.

261
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:47,161
- I'll do it.
- That makes me nervous.

262
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:49,204
It's social engineering.
I'll just hack her that way.

263
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:51,039
She won't suspect a thing.

264
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,753
If we don't try something new,
we're not gonna find Rachel.

265
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,510
Help yourself
to some boiled peanuts.

266
00:19:03,593 --> 00:19:05,679
No, thank you. Too much salt.

267
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:08,265
First week I was here,
I asked one of the stewards

268
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,850
if I could have some boiled peanuts.

269
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,519
I used to eat them all the time
as a kid, and I'll be damned

270
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:15,480
if there hasn't been a full bowl
of peanuts here every day since.

271
00:19:15,563 --> 00:19:18,358
They must have a pot boiling
'round the clock.

272
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:20,610
Ruth has me eating kale crisps now.

273
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:23,697
Says they're good for me.
I can't stand the things.

274
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,240
I have them shucked in the kitchen,

275
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:29,369
so you don't even have to get your
fingers dirty. Feel free. Live a little.

276
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:38,295
Mr. Justice, since we last spoke,
I've done a lot of soul searching.

277
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,548
It was unfair of me
to ask you to stay on the bench.

278
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:45,260
If you want to retire, you should.

279
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:48,013
I appreciate your consideration,
Mr. President.

280
00:19:48,096 --> 00:19:51,766
Well, I thought the first thing I should
do is to find a suitable successor.

281
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,895
Someone you would approve of
to put your mind at ease,

282
00:19:54,978 --> 00:19:57,231
- and I think I've found one.
- Who?

283
00:19:57,314 --> 00:20:02,194
- Heather Dunbar.
- I think she'd be an excellent justice.

284
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:03,778
I'm glad you agree.

285
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:07,824
Just an unlikely choice,
given how vociferous she--

286
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:09,409
With the Walker investigation, yes.

287
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:11,619
But that only increases
my estimation of her.

288
00:20:11,703 --> 00:20:13,747
She has a great sense of duty.

289
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,125
More than any Solicitor General
I've ever worked with.

290
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:21,088
I wish I'd known the reason
you invited me beforehand.

291
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:23,965
- I could have saved you the trouble.
- Why?

292
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:26,260
After I talked to you
a couple of months ago,

293
00:20:26,343 --> 00:20:28,678
Ruth said you'd given me a gift.

294
00:20:28,762 --> 00:20:31,681
That I would be miserable
if I weren't on the bench.

295
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:35,435
She talked to my sons
and they all agreed.

296
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,396
As long as I'm well enough
to serve the court,

297
00:20:37,478 --> 00:20:41,691
that's where I want to be.
And we'll keep an eye on 2016.

298
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:46,405
If it looks as though the Republicans
will win, I'll step down.

299
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:49,699
If not, I'll stay.
But, there's no rush.

300
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:57,124
Must I destroy this man?

301
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:59,042
Mr. President?

302
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:06,925
No. I won't.

303
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:09,094
Excuse me?

304
00:21:11,221 --> 00:21:17,018
I won't stand by
and watch you make this mistake.

305
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,022
I've thought this through.

306
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:26,403
We're not friends, Robert.
We don't know each other that well.

307
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,571
But I care about you.

308
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,658
Because you served
for more than 20 years on the bench.

309
00:21:31,741 --> 00:21:35,120
You've established legal precedents
that will outlive both of us.

310
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:38,957
And... maybe you can explain away
yesterday as a senior moment.

311
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,336
But what if another moment happens
that you can't explain away?

312
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,546
What if somehow the news
of your illness leaks?

313
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,009
Then every decision you've written
will be called into question.

314
00:21:49,092 --> 00:21:50,551
They'll be challenged.

315
00:21:50,635 --> 00:21:53,930
And a life's work will be undone
in a heartbeat.

316
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:56,808
Do you have some ulterior motive here?

317
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:59,144
Only your best interests.

318
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:00,854
But why the urgency?

319
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:06,901
I want to protect you.

320
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:11,031
Justice, I'm asking you,
I'm pleading with you.

321
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:15,785
Don't let events get out of your control.

322
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,537
Will you reconsider?

323
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:22,917
I appreciate your concern, Mr. President.

324
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:26,171
Let me speak again to Ruth
and I'll get back to you.

325
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:28,923
Thank you, Justice.

326
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:31,343
- It's a moratorium.
- We're not calling it that.

327
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:33,387
Call it whatever you want,
nobody's talking.

328
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,430
We're trying to prevent misinformation.

329
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:37,224
I'm supposed to write about AmWorks.

330
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:40,310
How can I do that when no one from
the executive branch will speak to me?

331
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,396
This thing's shifting
under our feet in Congress.

332
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,981
By the time I finish the morning brief,
it's already outdated.

333
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:47,775
I'm not asking for a one-on-one
with the president, but...

334
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:50,862
the Secretary of Labor, Treasury,
one of his economic advisors.

335
00:22:50,945 --> 00:22:53,114
Give you special treatment?

336
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:55,909
I think you issued the moratorium
because you're losing the battle.

337
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,618
It's 500 billion dollars.

338
00:22:57,702 --> 00:22:59,913
This is the largest jobs program
since the New Deal.

339
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:02,749
Of course it's a slugfest.
That doesn't mean we're losing.

340
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:05,168
Then let me speak to someone
who can confirm that.

341
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:07,712
Because all I'm hearing
from the Republicans is that

342
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:09,381
AmWorks will never
see the light of day.

343
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:12,300
I sympathize with you, Ayla.
I wish I could give you what you want.

344
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:16,971
- The president needs us.
- So we'll talk later.

345
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:21,226
Michael Corrigan,
the activist who organized the protest

346
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:22,769
at the state dinner last month,

347
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:25,355
arrested by Russian police
three hours ago in Moscow.

348
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:27,023
The video is going viral.

349
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:32,320
He's a high profile gay rights activist,
nationally and abroad.

350
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:35,740
And he's been very vocal in Russia
over the last six weeks.

351
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:37,784
Here's the bureau file on him, sir.

352
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:39,453
Have we been in touch with the Kremlin?

353
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:41,871
Secretary Durant
is in Tangier right now.

354
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:44,832
I briefed her by phone
and she reached out to Bugayev.

355
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,751
But they have not connected yet.

356
00:23:46,834 --> 00:23:50,297
Ambassador Grimes is making calls
in Moscow, but nobody's engaging,

357
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,966
other than to say they plan
on fully prosecuting him.

358
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:55,676
Ambassador, do you think
this could be in retaliation

359
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,178
for what you're doing at the UN?

360
00:23:57,262 --> 00:23:58,679
It could be.

361
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:01,640
The Russians are very upset
about this resolution.

362
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,393
I'll see what I can find out
from Moryakov.

363
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:06,187
Let's hold off on the press conference
until tomorrow.

364
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:08,731
I'd like to deliver some good news
instead of no news.

365
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:12,110
In the meantime, put out a statement
that we're in communication with Moscow.

366
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:14,321
And that we're doing
everything we can to get Mr. Corrigan

367
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:16,197
back to the United States.
Thank you all.

368
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:21,328
Personally, I hate the law.
It's medieval homophobic nonsense.

369
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:23,704
- But it's the law.
- I don't think it's coincidence

370
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:25,873
that Corrigan was arrested
after our conversation.

371
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:27,875
Well, I wouldn't think
it was a coincidence either.

372
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,752
So what do you hope to achieve?

373
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:32,046
The same thing as you do:
Mr. Corrigan's release.

374
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,507
If I withdraw the resolution.

375
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,384
I think Moscow would certainly see it
as a sign of goodwill.

376
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:40,180
Well, we don't barter goodwill
for the freedom of American citizens.

377
00:24:40,263 --> 00:24:43,350
I actually advocated
for his immediate deportation.

378
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,519
I agree that tossing him
in jail is counterproductive,

379
00:24:45,602 --> 00:24:47,479
but my superiors are adamant.

380
00:24:47,562 --> 00:24:50,357
Save Petrov from himself.

381
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,402
It's not my place to question him.
Unlike you, I'm not married to my boss.

382
00:24:57,572 --> 00:25:00,950
I'll relay the Kremlin's position
to the president.

383
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:06,789
If we give in,
the Jordan Valley plan is over

384
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:09,584
and we show the Russians
we can be blackmailed.

385
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:11,752
So we're just supposed
to let Corrigan rot away?

386
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:15,382
I think if we continue to drive hard
at the UN, we'll gain leverage.

387
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:17,509
- What does Cathy think?
- She agrees.

388
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:20,512
I'm gonna take flak every day
that Corrigan remains in jail.

389
00:25:20,595 --> 00:25:22,347
And you'll take more if you back down.

390
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,224
But it does mean I have
to get in front of the press

391
00:25:24,307 --> 00:25:26,226
with absolutely nothing
of substance to say.

392
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:28,520
You spent 20 years in Congress.
You're good at that.

393
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:32,982
It's good to hear you laugh.

394
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:36,110
Get some sleep.
I'll call you tomorrow.

395
00:25:36,194 --> 00:25:37,571
Good night.

396
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:43,243
Who specifically is communicating
between Washington and Moscow?

397
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:45,786
All of our communication
is between the State Department

398
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,414
and the Russian Foreign Ministry. Ayla.

399
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:50,875
In your statement, you persisted
in calling this a free speech issue,

400
00:25:50,958 --> 00:25:52,835
but isn't gay rights really
at the center of this?

401
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,589
Well, Mr. Corrigan was arrested
for speaking his mind.

402
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:58,383
- No matter what his opinions--
- Aren't you skirting that,

403
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:01,636
Mr. President, because your stance
on gay rights is unclear?

404
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:06,474
What is clear is that Mr. Corrigan's
detainment is unjust

405
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:08,393
and, as I said, we're doing
everything we can

406
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:10,395
to make sure that he can come home.
Yes, Zachary.

407
00:26:10,478 --> 00:26:13,231
Following up. Isn't dodging
gay rights a calculated move

408
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:16,025
for a man not running for office?

409
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:18,152
You think I'm dodging?

410
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:20,614
Well, then let me be
as clear as I possibly can be.

411
00:26:20,697 --> 00:26:22,657
Gay people have rights.

412
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:25,410
And this administration has
always believed that Mr. Corrigan

413
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:29,456
has the right to speak his mind without
fear of being arrested on any issue,

414
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:31,416
whether it's gay rights
or something else.

415
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:35,629
And what is also quite clear is that
you must have failed etiquette class.

416
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:39,798
Why won't you speak to John Pasternak,
Michael Corrigan's husband?

417
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:42,135
Mr. Pasternak has been trying
to contact the White House

418
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:44,638
- and no one will speak with him.
- I do apologize, I have a meeting.

419
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:47,348
I wish I could've gotten to all your
questions. Any further inquiries,

420
00:26:47,432 --> 00:26:50,184
please direct them to Mr. Grayson.
Thank you very much.

421
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:51,686
I apologize, sir.

422
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:56,691
- You went too far.
- I did my job.

423
00:26:56,775 --> 00:26:59,527
There's protocol.
There's basic decorum.

424
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:02,155
How about this: you lift
the moratorium for me on AmWorks,

425
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:05,116
I disappear for five weeks.
Focus on my long-lead piece.

426
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,743
I don't touch Corrigan or anything else.

427
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,286
You wanted me to chew you out.

428
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:10,288
If that's what it takes
to get us talking.

429
00:27:10,371 --> 00:27:12,707
Which is why I need your credential.

430
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:15,585
- What?
- Your credential.

431
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:19,756
- You're kidding.
- Do you see me laughing?

432
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,967
You don't control my credential.
The Correspondents' Association does.

433
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,720
And I just spoke to Joel Weinmann.

434
00:27:25,804 --> 00:27:29,015
- He wouldn't.
- You succeeded, Ayla.

435
00:27:29,098 --> 00:27:32,519
I'm lifting the moratorium for every
other member of the press corps.

436
00:27:32,602 --> 00:27:34,895
The price was your credential.

437
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:39,858
- He has no grounds.
- You disrespected the president,

438
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:43,404
the office, and most importantly,
your fellow colleagues.

439
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,948
- It wasn't a tough sell.
- Then this becomes my next story.

440
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:48,867
Punishing a member of the press.
Collusion. Pay for play.

441
00:27:48,951 --> 00:27:50,578
And I'll deny.

442
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:53,956
And do you think the head of the
association is gonna admit anything?

443
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,711
You don't have any friends, Ayla,
on either side of the fence.

444
00:27:57,794 --> 00:27:59,920
The president just made a statement
about free speech.

445
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:02,549
Now you're gonna start kicking
reporters out of the White House?

446
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:05,968
- No. Just you.
- No, not just me!

447
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:08,388
You're fucking with
the second largest daily in America.

448
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:11,683
You can get rid of me, but you can't
get rid of the institution I work for.

449
00:28:13,267 --> 00:28:15,645
You done?

450
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:18,690
Don't let your 15 minutes
of power go to your head, Seth.

451
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:24,487
You can keep the plastic if you want...
as a souvenir.

452
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:26,823
That's all it's good for, now.

453
00:28:36,332 --> 00:28:38,209
Hello?

454
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:39,544
Yeah.

455
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:44,965
Are you serious?

456
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:51,138
Okay.

457
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:52,348
Fuck.

458
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:57,687
I need to speak to the president.

459
00:28:59,313 --> 00:29:04,026
Through our laws,
we seek to create a more perfect union.

460
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,529
Government officials who abuse the law,

461
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:11,951
or, at the very least, exploit the edges
of it for their own personal gain,

462
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:16,748
tarnish our democracy and weaken
the bonds of our great nation.

463
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:19,834
The Democratic Party
must step out of the shadow

464
00:29:19,918 --> 00:29:22,128
of scandal and redefine itself.

465
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:24,505
I want her here
when she's done with this stunt.

466
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:29,427
Embracing a new era of transparency,
honesty and justice,

467
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,514
this country deserves a president
who has dedicated herself

468
00:29:33,598 --> 00:29:35,809
to those ideals in this court

469
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:40,688
and many others, who has spent
her entire life defending the law,

470
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:44,818
and who now wants to dedicate herself
to enforcing it.

471
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:48,404
Let's restore integrity
to the Oval Office.

472
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:53,159
Use its power to root out corruption
and lead by example.

473
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:57,037
Today, before my family and friends,

474
00:29:57,121 --> 00:30:00,416
my God, and the highest court
in our land,

475
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:06,255
I announce my candidacy for President
of the United States of America.

476
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:09,843
There was no indication
Ms. Dunbar had plans to run for president.

477
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:13,680
This will make her the second Solicitor
General in history to run for president,

478
00:30:13,763 --> 00:30:16,766
the only other being
William Howard Taft in 1908.

479
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,935
With President Underwood
declaring he will not--

480
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:23,272
- Mr. President.
- Ms. Dunbar.

481
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:26,526
Please, take a seat.

482
00:30:27,902 --> 00:30:30,196
- My letter of resignation.
- I can't accept that.

483
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:31,781
You're too valuable to us.

484
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:34,074
I can't run for office
as Solicitor General.

485
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:35,910
Then you should reconsider
running for office.

486
00:30:35,994 --> 00:30:37,578
It's too late for that, I think.

487
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:38,830
I don't understand, Heather.

488
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:41,833
I offered you a seat
on the Supreme Court.

489
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:43,918
If Jacobs was stepping down,
which he isn't.

490
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,420
You spoke to him.

491
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:49,131
As Solicitor General,
I'm friendly with all the justices.

492
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:53,344
I keep those relationships private
so no one will suspect any bias toward me.

493
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:56,055
But Robert and I are very close.

494
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:58,808
He and Ruth have me over
for dinner once a month.

495
00:30:58,892 --> 00:31:01,019
So you already knew
about the Alzheimer's?

496
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:02,687
He told me the day he was diagnosed.

497
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,565
I've never had anything
but his best interests at heart.

498
00:31:05,648 --> 00:31:07,984
You don't care about Robert.

499
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:09,986
You wanted to sideline me.

500
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:14,782
So you actually think
you have a shot at this office?

501
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:17,618
Yes, I do.
And so does the leadership.

502
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:19,746
You're in over your head, Heather,

503
00:31:19,829 --> 00:31:22,040
no matter what Birch
and Womack are telling you.

504
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:24,876
Why should it concern you,
Mr. President?

505
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,836
You've announced
that you're not running.

506
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,924
- Is this personal for you?
- Don't flatter yourself.

507
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:33,175
You got Walker, but you couldn't get me.

508
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,136
I don't have to run to make sure you
leave office. You couldn't win anyway.

509
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,890
I'm running because I know
I'd make a good president.

510
00:31:38,973 --> 00:31:41,768
You might very well
make a good president.

511
00:31:41,851 --> 00:31:44,144
But right now, you're being delusional.

512
00:31:44,228 --> 00:31:47,356
When Birch approached me, I wasn't sure.

513
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,276
I was tempted,
but I knew it was a long shot.

514
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:53,195
And when you offered the nomination,
I was overwhelmed.

515
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,322
It's what I'd been working toward
my entire career.

516
00:31:55,406 --> 00:31:57,075
But then I spoke to Robert.

517
00:31:57,157 --> 00:32:00,620
And when he told me how you
threatened him, I knew I had to run.

518
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:03,706
Someone needs to scrub the stink
from this office.

519
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,375
- I didn't threaten him.
- What would you call it?

520
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:07,794
I was trying to save him,

521
00:32:07,877 --> 00:32:09,921
in the same way I'm trying
to save you now.

522
00:32:10,004 --> 00:32:13,132
Once the news of his Alzheimer's
gets out, which it will,

523
00:32:13,215 --> 00:32:16,094
because no matter how much we all
try to lie about it, it's gonna leak,

524
00:32:16,176 --> 00:32:19,639
can you imagine what
that's going to do to his reputation?

525
00:32:19,722 --> 00:32:20,974
He deserves better than that.

526
00:32:21,057 --> 00:32:23,434
And you deserve better
than being an also-ran.

527
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:25,895
Help me convince him.

528
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:29,690
Take the seat on the court
where you belong.

529
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:33,027
Is this how you live with yourself?

530
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:36,948
By rationalizing the obscene
into the palatable?

531
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:43,621
I haven't excused you yet.

532
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:45,123
See you in Iowa.

533
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:14,360
I wouldn't have made it through
the past eight months without my faith.

534
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:18,614
But I wouldn't have made it
without this community, either.

535
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:22,535
And on tough days...

536
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:24,954
I remind myself of that.

537
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:27,790
That I'm not alone.

538
00:33:27,874 --> 00:33:31,210
That I have all of you.

539
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:35,422
And I think it's important
to acknowledge that.

540
00:33:35,506 --> 00:33:37,717
To give thanks.

541
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,927
So thank you.

542
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:41,804
All of you.

543
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,892
For always being there.
For always being here.

544
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:53,440
I have to go.
I'll see you soon.

545
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,532
Hey.
I just wanted to say, what you said...

546
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:03,367
it really connected with me.

547
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,827
- About community.
- Thank you.

548
00:34:04,911 --> 00:34:06,120
- Yeah.
- I'm glad.

549
00:34:06,204 --> 00:34:08,664
- I'm Lisa. Hi.
- Of course. Max. Hi.

550
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,833
- You're new.
- It was my first time, actually.

551
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:14,420
- Do you live around here?
- Towson. Just drove up.

552
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:16,130
How did you find out about us?

553
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:20,384
Online. Website.

554
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:25,098
Yeah, I was surfing around, and I was...
I was looking for something and...

555
00:34:25,181 --> 00:34:27,141
- It's stupid.
- No. No, no.

556
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:30,310
- Tell me.
- Um...

557
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:34,148
Okay, well, a few months ago, this girl...

558
00:34:34,232 --> 00:34:36,316
Um...

559
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,820
The love of my life, actually...

560
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:42,656
- Breakup?
- She just left me.

561
00:34:43,783 --> 00:34:45,034
Out of the blue.

562
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:50,414
You know, one day she just said
it was over and that was it.

563
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:54,334
Yeah. That's hard.

564
00:34:56,045 --> 00:34:58,798
I went through something similar
not that long ago.

565
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:00,382
Oh, really?

566
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:04,637
Sort of what I was talking about tonight
with the hard time I had been through.

567
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,639
What happened?

568
00:35:07,765 --> 00:35:08,933
Oh...

569
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:11,018
Ancient history.

570
00:35:11,102 --> 00:35:12,603
A guy left you?

571
00:35:13,896 --> 00:35:17,524
- It was a woman.
- Oh.

572
00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:24,115
I guess I'm not completely over it,
but time heals, you know?

573
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:25,616
Mm-hmm.

574
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:28,368
I gotta get home,
but it was nice to meet you, Max.

575
00:35:28,452 --> 00:35:30,370
Nice meeting you, Lisa.

576
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:40,881
Can we reschedule?
Let me see.

577
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:44,302
Yeah, yeah.
Can you move that up by a half an hour?

578
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:49,098
- Hello?
- Is this a good time, Ms. Dunbar?

579
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:51,600
- Who is this?
- Doug Stamper.

580
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,604
How did you get this number?

581
00:35:55,688 --> 00:35:57,898
Phone numbers are easy.
What you should be asking

582
00:35:57,982 --> 00:36:00,776
is how I knew you were meeting
with Senator Giallo tonight.

583
00:36:02,111 --> 00:36:03,863
Look down the hallway.

584
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,409
- Go ahead. I'll meet you down there.
- All right.

585
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:15,916
No. Stay where you are.
We wouldn't want to be seen together.

586
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:20,296
Did the president send you?

587
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:23,799
No. He and I aren't in touch.

588
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:25,676
Then why are you here?

589
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:28,679
You're forming your team.
I want to be a part of it.

590
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:31,349
- The real reason.
- That is the reason.

591
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:34,601
He sent you. Don't lie to me.

592
00:36:37,146 --> 00:36:40,024
I've been out of the game
for nine months, Ms. Dunbar.

593
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:41,650
I want to get back in.

594
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:43,236
You're forming your team,

595
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:45,112
and I want to get in
on the ground floor.

596
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:49,533
The leadership isn't enough.

597
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:53,620
You need the rank and file.

598
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:56,540
Their connections to county
and municipal power brokers.

599
00:36:56,623 --> 00:36:58,792
The chiefs of a thousand kingdoms

600
00:36:58,876 --> 00:37:01,420
in every primary
from Iowa to Super Tuesday.

601
00:37:01,503 --> 00:37:04,298
I worked in the whip's office
for ten years.

602
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:07,509
I have files on every single member.

603
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:10,930
What they want, who they sleep with,
what they eat for lunch.

604
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:13,473
I can be valuable to you.

605
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:16,476
How did you know I was meeting
with Giallo tonight?

606
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,645
You rub shoulders with the leadership.

607
00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:20,898
I rub shoulders with the people
who work for them.

608
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:30,032
Think about it, Ms. Dunbar.
That's all I ask.

609
00:37:30,116 --> 00:37:31,450
Going down.

610
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,541
I made a mistake.

611
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,961
I mean, the way she spoke
to me in the Oval,

612
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:44,797
I wanted to strangle her.

613
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,673
I mean, what is she thinking?

614
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:50,510
Running against an incumbent when
I offered her a seat on the court--

615
00:37:50,594 --> 00:37:53,139
She was going to run the moment
Birch whispered in her ear.

616
00:37:53,222 --> 00:37:56,350
Once people imagine themselves
in the Oval, there's no turning back.

617
00:37:56,434 --> 00:37:57,810
You know that as well as anybody.

618
00:37:57,893 --> 00:38:01,272
It's my own damn fault.
Shouldn't have given Jacobs the choice.

619
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:04,066
I should've just announced her
nomination before I even asked her.

620
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,026
- Should I come home?
- No.

621
00:38:07,153 --> 00:38:09,529
I just need to think.
I need to clear my head.

622
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:11,824
Tell me what I can do.

623
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:17,246
Why did I hold back?

624
00:38:18,247 --> 00:38:20,666
Why did I show Jacobs any mercy?

625
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:23,627
Francis, this doesn't sound like you.

626
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,213
Put this behind you.
Think about what's next.

627
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,884
It was because of Mahmoud.

628
00:38:32,428 --> 00:38:35,097
I let him get to me.

629
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:40,602
And all those flags on those coffins
and those soldiers, whose--

630
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:43,689
I deployed and then
I buried in the ground. It's my--

631
00:38:43,772 --> 00:38:46,442
Stop it. This isn't doing you any good.

632
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,944
I will talk about this
with you if you want,

633
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:51,238
but if you're doubting yourself,
I can't indulge that.

634
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:53,615
No, you're right, of course.

635
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,284
Well, let's talk in the morning.

636
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:58,078
- I'm here if you need me.
- I know.

637
00:38:59,288 --> 00:39:02,041
- Good night.
- Good night, Francis.

638
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:30,069
Yes, can you reach out
to Bishop Eddis for me?

639
00:39:30,152 --> 00:39:31,570
I'll hold.

640
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:53,800
Thank you, Meechum.

641
00:39:53,884 --> 00:39:56,136
- If we can have some privacy.
- Yes, sir.

642
00:39:58,556 --> 00:40:00,474
Still riding the Bonneville?

643
00:40:00,558 --> 00:40:04,061
Sold the '67 for a Pipeburn.
Beautiful bike.

644
00:40:04,144 --> 00:40:06,313
You should take me for a spin sometime.

645
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:08,232
I don't think so.

646
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:10,192
They're a death wish.

647
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:12,945
At least you know
you have a place in heaven.

648
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:19,826
What's on your mind, Mr. President?

649
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,288
The burial the other day.

650
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:27,126
You talked about Abraham and Isaac.
God giving up his only Son.

651
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:31,422
Between you and me, that's the same
sermon I always use at Arlington.

652
00:40:31,505 --> 00:40:34,883
You put enough soldiers in the ground,
you get tired of writing new ones.

653
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:39,763
- It was the first time I had heard it.
- Won't be the last.

654
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:44,310
I want to understand what justice is.

655
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:47,771
That's a big one.

656
00:40:47,854 --> 00:40:49,398
I know.

657
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:54,903
There's our justice,
the kind men create.

658
00:40:54,987 --> 00:40:59,116
We base it on things
like the Ten Commandments.

659
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,620
But those can be read
a million different ways.

660
00:41:02,702 --> 00:41:05,705
"Thou shalt not kill"
seems pretty clear.

661
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:09,209
Who's to say? If we didn't kill,

662
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:12,129
others would kill instead of us.

663
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:14,798
There's a lot of killing in the Bible.

664
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:16,342
King David was a warrior.

665
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:21,054
How do you reconcile that
with the laws that God gave Moses?

666
00:41:21,138 --> 00:41:24,016
Even those laws require interpretation.

667
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:28,312
There are two laws we have to remember
above all else.

668
00:41:30,189 --> 00:41:33,526
He tells us to love God

669
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:35,277
and to love each other.

670
00:41:37,196 --> 00:41:40,658
You can't love the people you kill.

671
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,284
You sure as hell can.

672
00:41:42,368 --> 00:41:45,663
And you have to love the people
who are trying to kill you.

673
00:41:46,913 --> 00:41:49,333
Jesus loved the Romans.

674
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:53,587
"Father, forgive them," he said,
"for they know not what they do."

675
00:41:53,671 --> 00:41:55,631
Why didn't he fight?

676
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:58,467
Why did he allow himself
to be sacrificed?

677
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:02,221
I ask myself that question a lot.

678
00:42:02,304 --> 00:42:04,598
I understand the Old Testament God,

679
00:42:04,682 --> 00:42:06,141
whose power is absolute,

680
00:42:06,225 --> 00:42:09,562
who rules through fear, but... him.

681
00:42:16,193 --> 00:42:19,029
There's no such thing
as absolute power for us,

682
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:20,989
except on the receiving end.

683
00:42:22,074 --> 00:42:24,243
Using fear will get you nowhere.

684
00:42:24,326 --> 00:42:26,953
It's not your job
to determine what's just.

685
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:30,541
It's not your place to choose
the version of God you like best.

686
00:42:30,624 --> 00:42:32,834
It's not your duty
to serve this country alone,

687
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:35,921
and it better not be your goal
to simply serve yourself.

688
00:42:36,004 --> 00:42:38,215
You serve the Lord.

689
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:41,594
And through him, you serve others.

690
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:46,557
Two rules:
Love God. Love each other.

691
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,892
Period.

692
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:51,687
You weren't chosen, Mr. President.

693
00:42:54,189 --> 00:42:56,149
Only he was.

694
00:43:02,155 --> 00:43:04,617
May I have a few moments?

695
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,161
For myself. To pray.

696
00:43:10,205 --> 00:43:11,998
It's all yours.

697
00:43:44,698 --> 00:43:46,116
Love?

698
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:49,035
That's what you're selling?

699
00:43:52,706 --> 00:43:54,958
Well, I don't buy it.

700
00:44:19,274 --> 00:44:21,276
Is everything all right, sir?

701
00:44:22,528 --> 00:44:25,489
I was praying and it just fell.

702
00:44:50,222 --> 00:44:52,766
Please have someone clean this up.

703
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,976
Yes, sir.

704
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,854
Well, I've got God's ear now.

705
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:05,632
