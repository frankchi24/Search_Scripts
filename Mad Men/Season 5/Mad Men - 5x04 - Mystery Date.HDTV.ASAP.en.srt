Just a minute.
Mr. Draper?

3
00:00:04,387 --> 00:00:05,347
Thank you, Dawn.

4
00:00:06,251 --> 00:00:07,763
She was the most qualified.

5

What am I gonna do
when you go home?

6

Are you really going
back to that office?

- No! You start tomorrow.

How many times is this
going to happen?

We're in midtown.
I'm going to run into people.

All they care about
is that they're see-through.

Why is transparency
desirable in pantyhose?

Hello, Stanley, Ginso.

I have amazing photos--

Crime scene snaps from
Chicago's student nurse massacre.

Oh, my God.

I'm telling you,
you're upset over nothing.

- You're making it worse. I'll get over it.
- Megan.

You should be.

- They look like rag dolls.
- Were they raped?

They don't know, but a
couple of these are naked.

62

- It went on for hours.
- Ugh.

- The rest just waited.
- They were tied up.

Megan. I've got

Ginsberg, you got to see these.

And I'll see you later.

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,974
The sex murders in Chicago.

70

- The student nurses.
- Really?

Take it.

- Oh, my God.
- Look at the bottom row.

73
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,656
I think this is going to make
the cover, not the riots.

74
00:03:49,723 --> 00:03:51,424
- Really?
- Yeah, we did the riots this week.

75
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,058
Watts a year later.

76
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:54,926
Plus, there have been
five riots this summer.

77
00:03:54,994 --> 00:03:56,861
I say it's better
than even money

78
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,697
Mr. Luce finds a
tasteful way to do this.

79
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,399
You know what-- Put it away.
It's disgusting.

80
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,167
It's one of those things
I wish I didn't see.

81

- And why are you laughing?
- We're not laughing.

82

No, you're excited by it.

83
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,674
Some girl trussed up
like a cut of meat?

84
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,309
Eight girls, but nine
were kidnapped.

85
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,711
One survived.

86
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:16,547
I only am escaped alone
to tell thee.

87
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:18,549
How did she do that?

88
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:22,320
She hid under the bed.
He lost count.

89
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,622

( Gas hissing )

94
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,570
It's been 25 minutes.
It's not even set.

95
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:43,305
I told you the jets
are clogged.

96
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:44,940
Give me some money.
I'll go to the bakery.

97
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,675
And we need to get beer.

98
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:48,744
Greg likes Schaefer.
Do we have time?

99
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:51,613
Not if you want me to get
the baby out of here by noon.

100
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:54,182
Why? He's going to want
to see Kevin more than me.

101
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,851
That's what he's going to say,

102
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:57,618
but he's going to
want you right away.

103
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,253
Let me go get my purse.

104
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,988
You're making me
very anxious right now.

105
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:03,758
It's okay to be anxious.
It's normal.

106
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:06,894
Everything's going to be
unfamiliar for both of you.

107
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:09,731
And who knows what he's seen?
Who knows what he's done?

108
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:11,932
He's a surgeon.
He wasn't in combat.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,033
He saw the same things
there he saw here.

110
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:16,570
Well, there are other things
that happen when men are away,

111
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:18,071
- especially at war.
- Stop it.

112
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:20,841
Stop talking
about men in general

113
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:22,409
when I know
it's all about daddy.

114
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:24,411
Even if there haven't
been other women,

115
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,146
he's not used to
listening to a woman.

116
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:29,282
It's just the idea
of coming home

117
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,149
and finding a little
hole in his life

118
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:33,018
and sticking his elbow through

119
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:35,087
until he can walk
all the way in.

120
00:05:35,154 --> 00:05:38,123
I know.

121
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:39,992
And that's why I want
to start with him

122
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:42,194
seeing his son
for the first time.

123
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:44,597
He'll know how to do that.

124
00:05:44,664 --> 00:05:46,964
You're right.

125
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,800
Do you really want a cake?

126
00:05:48,868 --> 00:05:50,869
Because it's going to take
me a while to get dressed.

127
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,771
Could you?

128

Stay out of her way.

It is Friday morning.

Someone called on Henry's phone

and said that they couldn't
get an airplane flight,

so someone's driving them back
from Buffalo tonight.

137

You'd think Henry
could get a flight.

138
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:22,198
I know.
He's so important.

because it's the summer.

Your mother lets you do that?

148

I'm on vacation.

149
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:49,325
I think the best thing
is for you to go out

150
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,492
in the fresh air
and get some sun.

151
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,661
I did.
It's really hot.

152
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:55,796
Stop complaining.

153
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:58,266
I don't want you to get rickets
in that haunted mansion.

How are you?

156
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,974
I have a cold, but you've
made me feel better.

157
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,475
Can't you come get me?

158
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,944
No. And don't ask again.

159

- <i>Okay, bye.</i>
- Bye.

- Are you sick?
- I'm great. Let's go.

161
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:22,455
So it starts with Ken Cosgrove

162
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:24,523
climbing out of the muck
and walking on dry land.

163
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,725
He says a bunch of nice stuff
about Ginsberg and you.

164
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:29,795
I told him not to use the word
genius about either of us.

165
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:32,831
Ahem, a woman
and her secrets--

166
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,633
Oh, the things
she'll never tell,

167
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,369
like how long
it took her to get ready

168
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:38,103
or the reason she's smiling.

169
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,804
A good-looking woman
at a party.

170
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:42,240
And where she got
the incredible shoes.

171
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:43,741
Another woman, not too catty,

172
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:46,311
says, "I love your shoes.
Where did you get them?"

173
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,347
We hold on five seconds of her showing
off the shoe from the calf down,

174
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:50,982
and this girl's legs
will be spectacular.

175
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,184
And, yes, you can
come to casting.

That's plenty.

Are you kidding?
I'm ready to take off here.

179
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:07,631
I just wanted to hear the tone
of your voice so I can make sure

180
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:09,833
it's not as annoying
as it is in everyday life.

181
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,234
- ( Snickers )
- It's called a regional accent.

you've got one, too.

Do you like this?

185
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,007
I never saw boards
for the Cinderella thing.

186
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:19,509
Well, you killed it,
and for good reason.

187
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:21,010
Cinderella and shoes
is a cliche.

188
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,978
- You could have TB.
- Sleeping beauty?

189

Snow white?
Nothing worked?

190
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:27,416
They're more about
necrophilia than shoes.

191
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,884
It's footwear.
Don't make that mistake.

We thought your flight might
be late because of the strike.

202

Yeah, we picked up
some folks in Honolulu

I'll take Kevin
and go get some,

Okay, that's a good idea.

It couldn't be avoided.

225
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:10,302
It was a long time ago
and I was unhappy.

226
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,772
Because you were married.

227
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,441
It's fine.
It's just embarrassing.

228

Why should you be embarrassed?

Seriously?

230
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,749
Because you're
married to me now.

You did.

And all I can think
is you feel guilty,

00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:14,410
"You'll never tell.
They'll never be able to."

325
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,114
I don't know.
What do you think, Mr. Butler?

326
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:20,483
I think Ken was right--
You're a genius.

327
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,885
( Coughing )

328
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:26,021
Square-on strategy.

329
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,656
I think the boys
did a good job.

330
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:30,025
The girl should be
European-looking.

331
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:31,994
Maybe get a French girl.

332
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,695
Great.

333
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:35,297
So?

334
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,066
Sold.

335
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:45,973
I have to tell you, young
man, you really know women.

336
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,942
I've never heard that before.

337
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,812
This really gets
inside their heads.

338
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,479
Well, to tell you the truth,

339
00:16:52,547 --> 00:16:54,115
they confuse me.

340
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:56,450
I mean, I keep thinking
about Cinderella.

341
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,618
We were going to come in here
and talk about Cinderella,

342
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,287
<i>but it's too dark.</i>

343
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,955
Really?

344
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,556
We were kind of hoping for it.

345
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:06,158
Nah, I don't think so.

346
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,328
I mean, she's running down
this dark side street.

347
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,895
And it's outside a castle,

348
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:12,799
so it's got those walls
and the cobblestones.

349
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,634
And she's running,
but she's only got

350
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,936
this one incredible shoe
for her incredible gown,

351
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,272
so she's hobbling,
wounded prey.

352
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:22,073
She can hear him behind her,

353
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,976
<i>his measured footsteps</i>
<i>catching up.</i>

354
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:29,748
She turns a corner.
Those big shadows.

355
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,116
And she's scared.

356
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,052
And then she feels
a hand on her shoulder

357
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,254
and she turns around.

358
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,056
And it doesn't matter
what he looks like.

359
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:43,961
He's handsome, at that moment
offering her her shoe.

360
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:45,863
<i>She takes it.</i>

361
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:50,167
She knows she's not safe,
but she doesn't care.

362
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,536
I guess we know in the end

363
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,405
she wants to be caught.

364
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,074
See? It's too dark.

365
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:03,747
Why don't we do that?

366
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:05,548
The man said sold.

367
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,183
You wanted Cinderella anyway.

368
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:09,318
- You forgot that.
- No, I said it was a cliche.

369
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:10,886
That's because you thought
they wouldn't like it,

370
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:12,755
but in your heart
you knew it was good.

371
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,290
In my heart I'm on the verge of
throwing you in front of a cab.

372
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:17,158
Okay.

373
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,561
So however proud of yourself
you're feeling right now,

374
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:23,131
just know that everything I'm
saying has "or else" after it.

375
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,367
Don't do that again.

376
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,903
Think of those ideas
in front of me.

377
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,372
Don't do that again.
( Coughs )

378
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,440
I gotta make a call.

379
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:37,245
He's such a decent guy.

380
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,548
You know you almost
got fired just now.

381
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:42,216
I don't think
you're right about that.

382
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:44,751
I'm positive.

383
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,022
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i>Mr. Draper is on line one.</i>

384
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:50,291
Hello. How'd it go?

385
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:52,492
Good.
What are you up to?

386
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,795
I'm keeping your chair warm.

387
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,231
So I'll swing by
and get you in an hour?

388
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:58,764
Well, why don't
you just go home,

389
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,366
climb into bed?

390
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:03,303
- Really?
- <i>Yes.</i>

391
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,204
I only need another
couple of hours.

392
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:06,739
And, Don,

393
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,707
<i>no smoking.</i>

394
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:27,625
( Coughing )

395
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,767
( Sighs )

396
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:43,074
Mohawk says that LBJ is scared

397
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,976
of forcing the mechanics
to arbitration

398
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:46,576
because he has
midterm elections

399
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,711
and he's worried about
losing the labor vote.

400
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:51,714
- That's good news.
- Yes, it is.

401
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:54,150
The strike's going to go on for
at least a couple more weeks

402
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:56,319
and Mohawk can sop up
all the extra routes.

403
00:19:56,387 --> 00:19:58,989
So they want us to walk
them through the campaign

404
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:00,690
first thing Monday morning.

405
00:20:00,757 --> 00:20:03,758
- A phone call will do.
- The campaign, of course.

406
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,527
We're ready to go.

407
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:09,264
Have a good weekend.

408
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:15,104
Damn it.

409
00:20:19,574 --> 00:20:21,942
Good night everyone, Clara.

410
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,711
<i>Good night,</i>
<i>Mr. Campbell.</i>

411
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:27,581
<i>( Laughter )</i>

412
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,650
Where's Ginsberg?

413
00:20:29,718 --> 00:20:32,753
He's probably everywhere after
Don scattered his ashes.

414
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:36,056
Apparently he went haywire
in the presentation downstairs.

415
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:37,491
I don't care.
Call him.

416
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:39,159
I just did.
He's not home.

417
00:20:39,227 --> 00:20:41,495
- Is he coming back?
- You know what?

418
00:20:41,562 --> 00:20:43,963
I'm going to go
out there and find him.

419
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:45,732
I'm going to start
the whole world

420
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,402
and then I'm going to
eventually check my apartment.

421
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:55,674
What are you doing tonight?

422
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:57,976
I don't know.
What did you have in mind?

423
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:00,046
Are you drunk?
Get your feet off that desk.

424
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:04,050
I need you to work up
something for Mohawk.

425
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:05,518
Oh, I'm sorry.

426
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:09,187
For Mohawk, your, quote,
"man" is Ginsberg.

427
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:12,257
Let's say you were
to do this for me

428
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:14,926
and on Monday you explain
to Ginsberg and Campbell

429
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,494
that I asked you to...

430
00:21:16,562 --> 00:21:19,664
Only I asked you
sometime last week.

431
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:24,368
Do you have a brief?

432
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:27,871
- Did Ginsberg have a brief?
- I never told Ginsberg, okay?

433
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:30,640
You have to remember that.

434
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,876
- You know about the airline strike, right?
- Yes.

435
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:34,744
Why is Mohawk still flying?

436
00:21:34,812 --> 00:21:36,880
Because even though all the
other mechanics are on strike--

437
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:38,647
Boo-hoo, they need more
wrenches or something--

438
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,083
Mohawk's mechanics
have a side deal,

439
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,317
so they have to keep working.

440
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:43,119
They must love that.

441
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:44,687
Yeah, well, they're going
to love the overtime.

442
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,289
American airlines
is taking everything big

443
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,424
and giving their northeast
corridor to Mohawk.

444
00:21:48,492 --> 00:21:50,293
( Sighs ) So what do you want?

445
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,860
How about something like

446
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:54,930
"Mohawk, breaking the strike
one flight at a time"?

447
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:58,567
Or maybe "Fly over
the picket line with Mohawk"?

448
00:21:58,635 --> 00:22:00,669
Hey, Trotsky,
you're in advertising.

449
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,772
Fine. So what's
the angle?

450
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,275
Campbell or I had this idea that
it would be something about,

451
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:09,578
you know, how times are tough

452
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:12,580
and you can't get anywhere.

453
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,816
So thank God Mohawk is
offering emergency service.

454
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:16,884
You don't want to use the word
emergency with an airplane.

455
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,153
I don't want to do any of this.
I'll see you Monday.

456
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,155
Hold on a second.

457
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:24,592
You want me to work up an entire
corporate image campaign for $10?

458
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,793
I can make you do it for nothing.
I'm the boss.

459
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,729
You're right

460
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:31,732
the work is $10,
the lie is extra.

461
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,100
Incredible.

462
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:34,768
What do you make
a week, sweetheart?

463
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:37,704
Mm, you don't know, uh?
That's helpful.

464
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,606
You know, I could fire you.

465
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:43,009
Great, there are some
portfolios in Joan's office.

466
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:44,644
Maybe you could find
somebody tonight.

467
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,478
Why are you doing this to me?

468
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:48,413
Because you're being
very demanding

469
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:50,750
for someone who has
no other choice.

470
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:52,885
- <i>( Sighs)</i>
- Dazzle me.

471
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,787
Fine.

472
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:56,421
How much you want?

473
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:57,790
How much you got?

474
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:06,031
- $400.
- Give me all of it.

475
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:09,000
Jesus!

476
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:11,169
It better be good.

477
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:13,171
You want me to take your watch?

478
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:15,472
( Sighs )

479
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:18,976
I'm on my way out.
Are you staying?

480
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:21,211
Hello.
Good night.

481
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,313

out of nowhere,

he kicked me so hard that I

at me and he said,

at Lincoln Center

642
00:32:41,548 --> 00:32:44,315
when you took me back
to the loading dock?

643
00:32:44,383 --> 00:32:46,852
Your wife was waiting inside.

644
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,979
So it's just me,
my brother, who's 19,

645
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:18,414
and my mother,
who says she's 39.

646
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:21,184
- Like Jack Benny.
- ( Both laugh )

647
00:33:21,252 --> 00:33:24,120
- Is your brother in school?
- No. He delivers furniture

648
00:33:24,188 --> 00:33:27,456
and argues with my mother
about joining the army.

649
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:30,426
Mm.

650
00:33:30,494 --> 00:33:34,263
You were saying something in the
taxi about Don and I cut you off.

651
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,198
No, I was finished.

652
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:41,103
You can talk to me.

653
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:44,372
I was his secretary, you know?

654
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,175
You were?

655
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:48,610
- So how did you--
- I didn't even ask for it.

656
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:51,446
Sometimes they drag
the secretaries in

657
00:33:51,514 --> 00:33:53,481
for focus groups to try things

658
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:56,484
and I was discovered...

659
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:59,321
Like Esther Blodgett.

660
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:01,255
( Laughing )

661
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:05,091
Oh, God, I'm really drunk.

662
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,994
Y'all drink a lot.

663
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:09,896
( Laughing )

664
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:16,236
So what were you going to say?

665
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,038
I was going to say--

666
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:20,973
Go ahead.
You can talk.

667
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,809
- I'm trying to.
- Oh.

668
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,344
( Laughing ) I'm sorry.

669
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:26,379
I was going to say
I hope you won't

670
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:28,981
tell Mr. Draper
about me sleeping there.

671
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,050
You two talk sometimes.

672
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:35,254
Nah.

673
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:37,356
We have to stick together.

674
00:34:40,493 --> 00:34:43,228
I know we're not really
in the same situation,

675
00:34:43,295 --> 00:34:46,231
but I was the only one
like me there

676
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:47,766
for a long time.

677
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:53,838
I know it's hard.

678
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:56,106
I appreciate that.

679
00:35:04,249 --> 00:35:06,550
Do you want to be a copywriter?

680
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:09,786
No. I like my job.

681
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:13,690
Yep.

682
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,158
You're right.

683
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:19,863
Copywriter's tough,

684
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,931
especially for a woman.

685
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,003
Do you think I act like a man?

686
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,241
I guess you have to a little.

687
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:38,947
I try, but...

688
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,282
I don't know
if I have it in me.

689
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:46,587
I don't know if I want to.

690
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:10,076
( Gasps )

691
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:13,178
I'm sorry.
I can't sleep.

692
00:36:13,246 --> 00:36:16,114
Well, you cannot sneak up
on someone my age,

693
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:17,917
especially in this house.

694
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:20,653
I'm scared.

695
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,255
Can I sit with you?

696
00:36:23,323 --> 00:36:24,990
Only for a bit.

697
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:33,297
What's that for?

698
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:36,634
Why are you scared?

699
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:38,402
I read the newspaper.

700
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:39,971
Oh, honey.

701
00:36:40,038 --> 00:36:42,173
Did you pull it
out of the trash?

702
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,974
Why did that man do that?

703
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:48,311
Well, probably because
he hates his mother.

704
00:36:48,379 --> 00:36:51,715
- I don't understand what happened.
- What happened?

705
00:36:51,783 --> 00:36:57,153
Those girls got ready for bed

706
00:36:57,221 --> 00:37:00,490
and there was
a knock on the door,

707
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:02,959
and a handsome man was there.

708
00:37:03,026 --> 00:37:05,327
And maybe one of them knew him,

709
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:07,396
but probably not

710
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:13,068
<i>because he was probably</i>
<i>just watching them from afar.</i>

711
00:37:13,136 --> 00:37:17,672
All those young,
innocent nurses

712
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,542
in their short uniforms

713
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,811
stirring his desire.

714
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:24,579
For what?

715
00:37:24,647 --> 00:37:26,481
What do you think?

716
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,550
You're old enough to know.

717
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:30,519
Why didn't they run away?

718
00:37:30,586 --> 00:37:32,653
Because they were scared.

719
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:35,756
They probably thought,
"He can't rape nine of us."

720
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:40,093
- Why not?
- You just can't.

721
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:43,531
They didn't know it was going
to be worse than that.

722
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:48,535
They didn't know what
was in store for them.

723
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,438
Now I'm really scared.

724
00:37:52,506 --> 00:37:54,774
It's not going to happen,

725
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:58,077
not while I've got
my burglar alarm.

726
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:02,114
How am I going to sleep?

727
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,284
Get the water.

728
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,120
What's that?

729
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:10,722
It's Seconal.

730
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,997
Do you know how to take a pill?

731
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,368
- ( Kevin crying )
- You two stop it.

732
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:26,604
Damn it, Joanie!

733
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:28,505
- Stop it.
- Gail, out!

734
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:31,375
Take him out of here!

735
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,143
- <i>( Pounding )</i>
- <i>Open this door</i>

736
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,946
or I will kick it down!

737
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,480
Who goes back?

738
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:41,150
I will throw a parade
for you every day

739
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,153
- to thank you for preserving freedom.
- It's done.

740
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,322
Well, you can't make a
decision like that without me

741
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,458
and you have never
understood that.

742
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:50,460
If this was World War II and the
Japs were still attacking us,

743
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:52,127
you'd say,
"Yes, of course!"

744
00:38:52,195 --> 00:38:55,464
Soldiers wanted to come home
from world war ii also!

745
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:58,634
I've got my orders,
you've got yours.

746
00:39:03,306 --> 00:39:07,076
- Where are you going?
- To meet the boys for a drink.

747
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,243
He just needs
to blow off steam.

748
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:10,678
Don't get involved, mother.

749
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,615
You're a military wife.
You make sacrifices.

750
00:39:13,682 --> 00:39:16,717
Someone's Kevin is over there and he's
going to get hurt and Greg won't be there.

751
00:39:16,784 --> 00:39:19,686
But our Kevin is right in
there and he doesn't care.

752
00:39:19,754 --> 00:39:21,855
It's a year.
You can do it.

753
00:39:21,923 --> 00:39:24,591
- I'll help.
- No.

754
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:26,192
Go lie down.

755
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,294
You don't even know
how tired you are.

756
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,727
I hope you don't
mind the couch.

757
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,662
Since my roommate moved
to the other room,

758
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,264
I just have a pile
of Abe's clothes.

759
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:44,932
This is perfect.

760
00:39:46,168 --> 00:39:47,935
Well, good night, then.

761
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:03,684
I-- I'll just--
I'll throw these out.

762
00:40:04,887 --> 00:40:06,586
Thanks.

763
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:13,426
Good night.

764
00:40:23,202 --> 00:40:24,970
I'll see you later.

765
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:26,972
No, you won't.

766
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,708
Don't argue with me.

767
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:31,610
I have to get out of here.

768
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:33,445
Hotel next time?

769
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:35,648
No next time.

770
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:37,615
That was a mistake.

771
00:40:37,683 --> 00:40:40,985
A mistake you love making.

772
00:40:43,188 --> 00:40:46,457
I'd better not see you again.

773
00:40:46,525 --> 00:40:48,726
You're not going to ruin this.

774
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:50,862
You loved it.

775
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,430
And you'll love it again

776
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:55,131
because you are
a sick, sick--

777
00:40:57,501 --> 00:41:00,336
( Gasping )

778
00:41:08,312 --> 00:41:09,812

779
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,454

<i>( TV playing )</i>

- Betty: <i>Hello? We're home.</i>

782
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:07,066
Ma.

783
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:08,868
- Ma.
- ( Groans )

784
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:13,272
What's going on?

785
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,140
Where's Sally?

786
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,376
Sally?

787
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:21,346
<i>Sally?</i>

788
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,588
<i>( Door opens )</i>

789
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:45,236
How are you feeling?

790
00:43:03,787 --> 00:43:05,454
Where were you?

791
00:43:05,522 --> 00:43:07,390
I was right there.

792
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:11,594
You're burning up.

793
00:43:13,597 --> 00:43:15,864
No, last night.

794
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:20,068
I was waiting for you.

795
00:43:20,135 --> 00:43:22,103
I came right home.

796
00:43:22,171 --> 00:43:25,207
You were a mess.
I was really worried.

797
00:43:31,914 --> 00:43:33,981
You don't have
to worry about me.

798
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,588
Okay.

799
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:57,136
There are some scrambled
eggs in the bowl

800
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:59,372
and I made flapjacks.

801
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,107
Just coffee.

802
00:44:01,174 --> 00:44:03,476
- Where's Kevin?
- You slept a long time.

803
00:44:03,544 --> 00:44:05,177
He was awake and went
back to bed already.

804
00:44:05,246 --> 00:44:07,246
I barely slept at all.

805
00:44:12,385 --> 00:44:16,221
I've been thinking
about it and...

806
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,657
I want you to go.

807
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:20,925
I'll put this away.

808
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:26,597
I'm glad you came around.
It's only a year.

809
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:31,335
No. I want you to go
and never come back.

810
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:34,639
Damn it, Joanie.
They need me.

811
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:37,775
Well, then, it works out,
because we don't.

812
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,710
I'm very important there.

813
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,812
I have 20 docs and medics
who rely on me.

814
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,347
They look to me
for my skill and leadership.

815
00:44:45,415 --> 00:44:49,752
I'm glad the army
makes you feel like a man,

816
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,155
because I'm sick
of trying to do it.

817
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,357
The army makes me feel
like a good man.

818
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:58,928
You're not a good man.

819
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,863
You never were,
even before we were married,

820
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:04,666
and you know
what I'm talking about.

821
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:19,146
If I walk out
that door, that's it.

822
00:45:23,151 --> 00:45:25,419
That's it.

823
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:46,206
It's over.
