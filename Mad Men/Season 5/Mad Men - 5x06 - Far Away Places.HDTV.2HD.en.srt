1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:02,030
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,743
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

3
00:00:03,913 --> 00:00:05,005
They'll knock the door...

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,626
- What time is it?
- Shut up.

5
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,858
- You want it so bad...
- I don't want you!

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:15,761
I'm really sorry about that.

7
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:17,007
Please!

8
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:18,311
This is a process.

9
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:19,936
I just want to be
a part of this place.

10
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:21,623
I think it's on the way up.

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,906
I got the job.

12
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:24,434
You don't say...

13
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:26,399
I can't stay that long...

14
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:28,658
I have to go back and
redo the Heinz speech.

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,751
Did you eat my pack
of violet candy?

19
00:01:13,786 --> 00:01:15,486
What?

20
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:17,356
It's purple and silver.

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,725
Don gave it to me
before a presentation once.

22
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,860
- No.
- I need it.

23
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:24,829
- So you'll buy another one.
- That's not the same.

24
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:26,464
Don't be such
a strict catholic.

25
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:28,366
I'll buy one for you
and I'll say a brucha.

26
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,868
How about tonight we go
see that stupid movie

27
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:34,070
about the guy being
hunted in Africa?

28
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:37,139
- "The Naked Prey."
- I don't know, Abe.

29
00:01:37,173 --> 00:01:39,407
You're gonna resist the chance
to see Cornel Wilde naked?

30
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:42,142
I heard he wrestles a boa constrictor.
Sounds pretty dirty.

31
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:44,044
I can't think beyond
my presentation.

32
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,547
There's always special
circumstances.

33
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,383
That's not true.

34
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:51,219
I've been working
on Heinz for months.

35
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:54,890
You know what you want?
You want to take me to work with you

36
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:57,759
and stick me in a drawer and
open it whenever you get bored.

37
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:00,962
Fine. You don't want to
see each other anymore?

38
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,031
Jesus!

39
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:06,135
You always want to push the
button on the whole thing.

40
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,069
I come all the way
up here to make love.

41
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:11,607
Half the time you don't want to and then
you just do it to get it over with.

42
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,475
It's just hard when I come
right from work.

43
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,276
I need a second
when I walk in the door.

44
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:18,312
- You sound like my dad.
- ( Sighs ) Fine.

45
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,616
We'll go to the movies. I just can't
promise that my mind won't be elsewhere.

46
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,350
Your mind is always elsewhere.

47
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:25,586
Why are you doing
this right now?

48
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,890
Most men wouldn't even have
this conversation. They'd just leave.

49
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:30,859
And why would they do that?

50
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:34,495
I'm your boyfriend,
not a focus group.

51
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,730
Have a shitty day.

52
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,633
<i>( Door closes )</i>

53
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,035
I don't know.
Can't you make it till Friday?

54
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,239
Because today
is not a good day.

55
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:49,142
This conversation went in a circle
and we're back where we started.

56
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:51,143
The answer is no.

57
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:54,380
Yeah, me, too.

58
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:56,149
I just had the same
conversation.

59
00:02:56,183 --> 00:02:57,951
No, I think they were different
because yours was private.

60
00:02:57,985 --> 00:03:00,419
( Sighs ) Sorry I'm late.

61
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,355
There's no place
to pee in this city.

62
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,857
- She just got here.
- Then why are you giving me a hard time?

63
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:07,960
We had the funniest thing
outside our building.

64
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:11,530
A bunch of students with backpacks
asked us how to get to Broadway.

65
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:14,065
What's so funny
about that, Jethro?

66
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,968
It's like the campaign.
We could have cast it right there and then.

67
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:18,836
Stan:
Mmm.

68
00:03:18,871 --> 00:03:21,772
- Megan, can I have a moment?
- Oh, uh, sure.

69
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:23,874
- She goes to casting now?
- I guess so.

70
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,576
She's kind of been
my junior on this.

71
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,879
I was buying dinner last night
for this large-breasted girl

72
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:31,348
who calls herself salome,
and she's looking at the menu,

73
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:35,152
ridiculing this Grandma Moses drawing
and she's bas-out funny.

74
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:38,255
But I ignore her
because all I can think of

75
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:41,591
is I'll never be able to draw
as well as a photograph.

76
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:48,231
Oh, thank God.

77
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:50,466
I couldn't take
one more omen of doom.

78
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,168
I'm sorry. We're gonna have
to miss the presentation.

79
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:55,070
We have to head upstate
for Howard Johnson's.

80
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:57,405
- Really?
- You're running the show.

81
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,674
How does me sitting there
change anything?

82
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:01,209
Howard Johnson's, huh?

83
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:03,778
I love the colors,
the atmosphere,

84
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:06,314
- the clams.
- She's never been to one.

85
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:10,719
I'm really sorry.

86
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,121
No, we have all
your work, I guess.

87
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:15,490
I'll check in from the road.
Get your stuff.

88
00:04:20,763 --> 00:04:23,498
Um, break a leg.

89
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:27,702
- Well, that's a disaster.
- Don't listen to him.

90
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,337
That's a vote of confidence.

91
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:31,272
Give me one of those.

92
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,844
The fire is primal.

93
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,948
These kids, they all
come there alone,

94
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,750
and gathered in a circle,
they suddenly feel

95
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:48,387
included.

96
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,656
They're safe from
whatever is out there

97
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,725
in the night, in the darkness.

98
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,061
It's the beans
that brought them together

99
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,998
on that cool night
at the end of the summer.

100
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,438
"Home is where
the Heinz is."

101
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,041
I wish someone
was eating beans.

102
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,876
That guy is.

103
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,711
I did ask for college students.

104
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,580
I know that, Raymond.

105
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,849
And we want you to have
everything you asked for.

106
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,284
Well, stop writing down
what I asked for

107
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:22,186
and try to figure out
what I want.

108
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,657
Raymond, I saw you
when she was talking.

109
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,959
- You were off somewhere.
- It's very sentimental.

110
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,527
I have that memory.

111
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,596
That's for me.
That's not for kids.

112
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,867
Kids have memories.

113
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,770
And so do the homemakers
who make a home with Heinz.

114
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,672
Raymond, can you see
how passionate she is?

115
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:43,575
Photography will really capture
the fun on their faces.

116
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,778
- And the glow.
- Did Don sign off on this?

117
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,548
Don loves this work.

118
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,883
Maybe Don doesn't understand
what you wanted either.

119
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,351
Let's not speak for Don.

120
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,687
I'm sorry. I'm not a word
person like you people.

121
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,189
Sure, you are.

122
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,458
And your words are always
"I don't like it."

123
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,595
And I think you're right.
We don't understand you.

124
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,763
Because you do like it.

125
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:07,532
I think you just like fighting.

126
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:08,866
Peggy, you're being
oversensitive.

127
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,236
Do you know how often
people come in here

128
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,206
and look at work
and feel something?

129
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,475
Almost never.

130
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,310
You have to run with this.

131
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:21,779
It's young and it's beautiful.

132
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:25,216
And no one else is gonna figure
out how to say that about beans.

133
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,819
Can you believe this girl?

134
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,821
I don't know.

135
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:32,823
Can you?

136
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:35,393
Miss, you're lucky
that I have a daughter

137
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,261
or I wouldn't be
so understanding.

138
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,098
Raymond, they're frustrated,

139
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:42,400
but they're not through.

140
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,902
I'm frustrated, too.

141
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,141
- It's close, I guess.
- It's damn close.

142
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:52,109
Why don't just you and I
have dinner tonight?

143
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:54,878
Maybe take in a show?
Take your mind off things?

144
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,880
You can try.

145
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,690
Stan:
<i>I've got to admire you.</i>

146
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:09,660
That was a completely
suicidal move.

147
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,696
Women usually want to please.

148
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,066
Give me sketches
of the talking beans.

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,068
I'll write new dialog.

150
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,677
- You're off the business.
- What'd he say?

151
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,712
He said you're off
the business.

152
00:07:41,697 --> 00:07:43,631
Everyone has
somewhere to go today.

153
00:07:43,665 --> 00:07:45,199
I'm going to the movies.

154
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:47,068
Very good.

155
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:58,881
Man: <i>One of them gave Sam</i>
<i>a first-class scratch.</i>

156
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:01,083
Not very good-tempered,
are they?

157
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,818
Woman: <i>Well, neither are
you when you're hungry.</i>

158
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,487
<i>I don't suppose</i>
<i>you've fed them.</i>

<i>No, I can't say I have.</i>

160
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,259
<i>You didn't pack any lion's</i>
<i>milk for me before I left.</i>

161
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:12,529
<i>You didn't ask me.</i>

162
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:15,299
You're going to get in trouble.

163
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,568
Want some?

164
00:08:19,303 --> 00:08:21,071
Sure.
What the hell.

165
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:28,278
<i>Come on.</i>

166
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:35,719
- Hello.
- Hi.

167
00:08:35,754 --> 00:08:37,688
<i>But why don't they?</i>

168
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,356
<i>It's at least two days</i>
<i>since they've eaten.</i>

169
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:41,024
- <i>They'll just die.</i>
- <i>Yes, I know.</i>

170
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,427
<i>It must be the formula.</i>
<i>We haven't hit on it yet.</i>

171
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,329
<i>We'll just have try again.</i>

172
00:08:45,364 --> 00:08:47,899
<i>Right, back to</i>
<i>the drawing board.</i>

173
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,201
<i>Formula...</i>
- <i>13.</i>

174
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:57,508
<i>Oh, George, I've just been
thinking about the cod-liver oil.</i>

175
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:00,578
( Growling )

176
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:06,050
She's not gonna make it
out there on her own.

177
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:08,452
- Woman: Shh.
- You've got to keep it down.

178
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:11,221
( Giggling ) Okay.

179
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,625
Aren't you worried?

180
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,330
It'll turn out all right.

181
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:37,581
Woman: <i>That evening, we suffered
all the agony of parents</i>

182
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:39,417
<i>whose teenage daughter</i>
<i>is out on her first date.</i>

183
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:41,186
No.

184
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,726
Just watch the movie.

185
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:54,766
<i>We returned the next day</i>
<i>only to find Elsa</i>

186
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,401
<i>minus both the young</i>
<i>lion and her food.</i>

00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:05,743
<i>( Lion roaring )</i>

<i>( Water running )</i>

189
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,851
Morris: <i>I told you a dozen</i>
<i>sometimes I was coming in.</i>

190
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:14,453
And I said no,
you're not coming in.

191
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:15,988
'Cause you don't want
I should see you?

192
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:17,757
<i>You see me at home,</i>
<i>for Christ's sake.</i>

193
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,526
You stare at me
when I'm sleeping.

194
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,194
Eh, I don't want
to see you anyway.

195
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,163
- I just want to use the photocopy.
- For what?

196
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:25,766
I'm building my case.

197
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,834
Again?

198
00:10:27,869 --> 00:10:29,570
Who's this?

199
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:32,639
I'm Peggy Olson.
I work with Ginsberg.

200
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,209
Well, I'm the original.

201
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,578
Okay. Ahem.
It's bedtime.

202
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,245
Miss Olson.

203
00:11:15,618 --> 00:11:17,986
- What time is it?
- It's 8:30.

204
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,521
Mr. Draper's on the phone.

205
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,627
I'll take it in here.
You can go.

206
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:26,662
Good night.

207
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:36,004
- Hello. - Dawn didn't get any
calls. Did you get any calls?

208
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,873
- About what?
- Has anyone called you?

209
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,775
I don't think so.

210
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,144
Oh, okay.

211
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,214
Listen, it didn't go well.

212
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,984
- <i>I've got to go.</i>
- I take full responsibility.

213
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:50,652
<i>( Hangs up )</i>

214
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,922
Hello?

215
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,661
( Sighs )

216
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:08,372
Why didn't you tell me
you had a family?

217
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:11,776
- Your father's nice.
- He's not my real father.

218
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,878
People don't understand.

219
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:16,681
- Are you adopted?
- Actually, I'm from Mars.

220
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:19,016
( Laughs )

221
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:21,552
It's fine if you don't believe
me, but that's where I'm from.

222
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:24,355
I'm a full-blooded martian.

223
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,923
( Laughs )

224
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:28,493
Don't worry.
There's no plot to take over Earth.

225
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,630
We're just displaced.

226
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,799
Okay.

227
00:12:33,834 --> 00:12:36,035
I can tell
you don't believe me.

228
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:39,339
That's okay.
We're a big secret.

229
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:42,309
<i>They even tried</i>
<i>to hide it from me.</i>

230
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:45,145
That man, my father,

231
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:48,081
told me a story I was born
in a concentration camp,

232
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,749
but you know that's impossible.

233
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:54,620
And I never met my mother because
she supposedly died there.

234
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:56,888
That's convenient.

235
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,025
Next thing I know, Morris there finds
me in a Swedish orphanage.

236
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,727
<i>I was five.</i>
<i>I remember it.</i>

237
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:04,630
That's incredible.

238
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:06,365
Yeah.

239
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,367
And then I got
this one communication.

240
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:10,336
A simple order.

241
00:13:12,072 --> 00:13:14,675
Stay where you are.

242
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,946
Are there others like you?

243
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,715
I don't know.

244
00:13:22,652 --> 00:13:25,520
I haven't been able
to find any.

245
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:47,107
( Phone ringing )

246
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,148
- Hello?
- Hi. It's me.

247
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:56,651
You at work?

248
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,353
No, I'm home.

249
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:02,491
Come up here.

250
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,627
You need me, huh?

251
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,896
I always need you.

252
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,032
<i>What happened?</i>

253
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:14,335
This guy told me the strangest
thing at work today.

254
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,403
<i>Yeah?</i>

255
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,707
He said he was born
in a concentration camp.

256
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,109
But that's impossible, right?

257
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:25,078
It happened.

258
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:28,616
- Come up here.
- <i>Okay.</i>

259
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,385
Hurry.

260
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:47,237
I'm going to go in there and
sit down with the door closed.

261
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,506
And I want you to buzz me
when he comes in.

262
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,010
One buzz for Don, two
buzzes for Mr. and Mrs.

263
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:02,788
<i>( One buzz )</i>

264
00:15:05,224 --> 00:15:07,125
- Who died?
- Let's play hooky.

265
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,760
Should I close the door?

266
00:15:08,794 --> 00:15:11,362
Remember when we used to
represent double-sided aluminum?

267
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:13,765
I remember twins
and a hospital.

268
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,533
Not that part.

269
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,735
Bob Whozit's moved over
to Howard Johnson's

270
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,404
to help them with
their new models.

271
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:23,007
So how about a completely
debauched and unnecessary

272
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:26,410
fact-finding boondoggle
to the flagship in...

273
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,580
Plattsburgh, New York?

274
00:15:29,615 --> 00:15:32,817
Just an hour from
scenic lake placid.

275
00:15:32,851 --> 00:15:35,686
- Are you kidding me? - Did you ever hear
the one about the farmer's daughter?

276
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,622
This is where
it all takes place.

277
00:15:37,656 --> 00:15:41,092
- No.
- Don, come on.

278
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:44,295
Alone, I'm an escapee from some
expensive mental institution.

279
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,765
But the two of us, we're a couple
of rich, handsome perverts.

280
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:51,168
- I love Howard Johnson's.
- We'll try and stop by.

281
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:53,504
I think Montreal
is an hour away.

282
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:56,307
Look, the whole point of going
is to forget about her.

283
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:59,043
I mean, I'm supposed to have
dinner with Jane's snooty friends,

284
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:01,312
sit around talking about
Frank Lloyd rice.

285
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:03,447
I always say it that way.
They hate it.

286
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:05,449
- ( Laughs )
- You know what?

287
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:09,987
- I'm gonna take Megan.
- Really?

288
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:11,988
You can bring Jane.

289
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:13,390
Megan gets along with everyone.

290
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:15,325
You're very funny.
Forget it.

291

Newlyweds.

292
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,128
I'll give Dawn the guy's name.

293
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,702
Dawn, I need you to get
me out of everything

294
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,370
through the weekend.

295

<i>( Phone rings )</i>

296
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,041

Don:
<i>Megan, can I have a moment?</i>

298

- You're not gonna say anything?
- What?

300
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:48,125
I said you look nice and I
said I don't want to do this.

301
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,826
Well, what do you want to do?

302
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:51,929
Go home, open your vest
and yell at the TV

for the next 20 years?
Go ahead.

304

God.

305
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:58,870
Okay, I'm sorry.
I don't know these people.

306
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:00,506
I do.

307
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,708
And it's not about them.

308
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:05,877
It's very important to me.
I don't know how many ways to say it.

309
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:10,381
I should have worn
something more comfortable.

310
00:17:10,416 --> 00:17:12,817
You really do look great.

311
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:18,136
It's the study of the ways the
things are true or false.

312
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:21,533
Some things are possibly true.
Some are necessarily true.

313

Some used to be true.
Some will be true.

314
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:26,472
Some are true on this planet,
but not necessarily others.

315
00:17:26,506 --> 00:17:29,409
So there's no good and bad
because the truth is relative?

316
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,878
Even if the truth is what
you would call relative,

317
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:33,980
good and bad are not relative.

318
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:36,049
Your mistake is
that you're assuming

319
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,151
That because something
is true that it's good.

320
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:41,120
- Professor's got you there.
- ( All laugh )

321
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:43,889
I think the truth is good
because it's always real

322
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,724
on any planet.

323
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:48,159
I have patients who spend years

324
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,428
reasoning out their
motivation for a mistake.

325
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:52,830
And when they find it out, they
think they've found the truth.

326
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,465
They probably have.

327
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:57,635
- And then they go and make
the same mistake. - Like who?

328
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,405
Catherine has been the
psychiatrist to some celebrities.

329
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,676
- Wow.
- So they never get better?

330
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,115
I didn't say that.
I just said that it's a myth

331
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:11,218
that tracing logic all the
way down to the truth

332
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:14,121
is a cure for neurosis
or for anything else.

333
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:16,157
Is there a cure for neurosis?

334
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,658
Love works.

335
00:18:19,261 --> 00:18:22,964
I say we postpone this conversation
until after we turn on.

336
00:18:22,998 --> 00:18:25,366
- Shall we?
- Or after we turn in.

337
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,368
Jane, honey, you ready?

338
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:32,106
What do you think you're doing?

339
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,775
I took your college course.
I say it's time to hit the sack.

340
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,379
- No, we're gonna do this.
- Do what?

341
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:41,282
I told you, we're going
to take LSD with them.

342
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:42,851
You were supposed to
clear your schedule.

343
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:46,321
LSD?
Really?

344
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:49,291
You really are never
listening, are you?

345
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:52,462
- How long does it last?
- Please.

346
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:54,898
I don't want to do this alone.

347
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,533
It'll be good for us.

348
00:18:57,702 --> 00:18:59,202
Okay.

349
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:06,909
Just copy what they're doing.

350
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:11,313
I think we are going to go.

351
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:15,016
- Oh, no.
- We had a lovely time.

352
00:19:24,193 --> 00:19:26,628
No one has to stay.

353
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,596
All I'll say is

354
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:31,433
that I have taken it
now four times

355
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:34,469
and every experience was more
beautiful than the last.

356
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,272
And I'm not gonna take it.
I'll be here to guide you.

357
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,474
I'm excited.

358
00:19:39,508 --> 00:19:41,577
I'm not gonna lie;
I'm a little nervous.

359
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,113
This is an experience
of self-fulfilling prophecy.

360
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:46,448
You have to enter into it
with a spirit of optimism.

361
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:49,351
It's like a boat trip.
You don't cast off thinking about sinking.

362
00:19:49,386 --> 00:19:52,354
And this boat is perfect.
And the water is calm.

363
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:54,990
No, you hold on to that.

364
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:57,793
Go ahead.

365
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:01,430
Just let it melt
on your tongue.

366

I never take you anywhere.

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:26,393
I'm sorry I always say it,
but you are so beautiful.

474
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,465
Last night was beautiful.

475
00:27:30,499 --> 00:27:32,400
It was, wasn't it?

476
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:36,004
Where are you going?

477
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:38,707
Out the door

478
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,642
and into the elevator,
I suppose.

479
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:42,577
What about me?

480
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:45,814
You can take
your time, obviously.

481
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:49,318
I figured I'd just check
into a hotel for a while.

482
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:51,553
I don't want to displace you.

483
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,924
What are you talking about?

484
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:58,860
I imagined all the screaming
and fighting and lawyers.

485
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,797
It's just so beautiful

486
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:05,900
how we were able
to be there together

487
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:09,171
in the truth like you wanted.

488
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,911
- Are you leaving me?
- No.

489
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:18,014
We're leaving each other
just like you said.

490
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,383
- I didn't say that.
- You did.

491
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,018
You said so many
amazing things.

492
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:24,855
- You were speaking German.
- I don't know German.

493
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:26,290
You were quoting your father.

494
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:28,625
It must have been yiddish.

495
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,196
But I was on drugs.
I obviously didn't mean any of it.

496
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,399
So your psychiatrist
didn't tell you that you knew

497
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:37,402
is was over, but you were
waiting for me to say it?

498
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:39,404
I did say that.

499
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,975
It's good that you did
because we both know it.

500
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:45,844
No.

501
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,381
I don't know.

502
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:58,691
It's going to be
very expensive.

503
00:28:58,725 --> 00:29:00,693
I know.

504
00:29:28,154 --> 00:29:29,955
Dawn, I need you to get
me out of everything

505
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,758
through the weekend.

506
00:29:33,394 --> 00:29:35,028
It was a dumb idea.

507
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:40,366
- Megan, can I have a moment?
- Oh, uh, sure.

508
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,770
Listen, there's
a Howard Johnson's upstate

509
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:48,307
I thought we'd go and make
a long weekend of it.

510
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:50,075
- What about Heinz?
- What about it?

511
00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:52,911
It'll be fine.
Remember California?

512
00:29:52,945 --> 00:29:55,480
- Two hotel rooms.
- Of course.

513
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:58,416
- But we can go tomorrow.
- Come on.

514
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,786
Let's go right now.
We can do this.

515
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,922
I don't know.

516
00:30:03,956 --> 00:30:05,957
I'm the boss.
I'm ordering you.

517
00:30:05,992 --> 00:30:07,859
Come on.

518
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:18,335
You know it's like an hour
and a half from my parents.

519
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,970
They're coming to visit soon.

520
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:22,606
I know.
You're right.

521
00:30:22,641 --> 00:30:24,674
And we don't have
to work much tonight.

522
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:28,178
Someone named Dale is going to
give us the royal treatment.

523
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:30,213
You like orange sherbet?

524
00:30:30,248 --> 00:30:32,549
- I don't know.
- You've never had it?

525
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:37,987
- You are in for a treat.
- Sounds great.

526
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:40,190
Everything okay?

527
00:30:40,192 --> 00:30:42,292
I'm just tired.

528
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:44,728
So take a nap.
Relax.

529
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:47,398
When you wake up, you will
feel like you're on vacation.

530
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:50,568
You know what? Tell me more about
what we're going to be doing

531
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:53,704
in Howard Johnson's
so I can get some sleep.

532
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:09,388
( Exhales )

533
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:11,290
( Coughing )

534
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:13,293
Could you open your window?

535
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:23,569
I wonder how Heinz went.
Peggy seemed nervous.

536
00:31:23,604 --> 00:31:25,404
Peggy knows what she's doing.

537
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,906
What are you worrying
about that for?

538
00:31:27,974 --> 00:31:29,908
I feel like I abandoned
the team.

539
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:33,010
You feel bad because you got to
take off and they had to work?

540
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:34,912
<i>I don't.</i>

541
00:31:34,946 --> 00:31:36,880
There has to be some advantage
to being my wife.

542
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:41,986
I'll check in with Peggy later.

543
00:31:42,021 --> 00:31:44,423
Okay.

544
00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:51,097
They got an indoor pool.

545
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:52,599
Did you bring that
suit from Acapulco?

546
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,267
I forgot.
I was rushing.

547
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:56,503
We'll get you a new one after we check in.
I brought mine.

548
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:58,305
- Mr. Draper?
- It's Don.

549
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,374
Pleased to meet you.
This is my wife Megan.

550
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:02,142
Dale Vanderwort.

551
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:04,679
A little more notice, I would have
rolled out the orange carpet.

552
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:06,781
I've got your room
all set for you.

553
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:09,517
Actually, I'd like something
to eat and something to drink.

554
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:11,819
Sure, I'm going to bring you
a sampling of everything.

555
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:14,555
- Do you like clams?
- I like everything.

556
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:35,709
I got you something.

557
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:44,050
I got one for Bobby and I got a
box of saltwater taffy for Sally.

558
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:45,785
What did you get for gene?

559
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:48,254
Sally will share
and she'll make Bobby share.

560
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:50,622
I was the youngest, Don.
You can't forget about him.

561
00:32:50,656 --> 00:32:53,024
Trust me, he won't
know the difference.

562
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:55,493
Didn't make much of a dent.
Anything to your liking?

563
00:32:55,528 --> 00:32:57,862
- We had a little of everything.
- Should I bring some desserts?

564
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,697
Yes, how about some pie?

565
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:02,333
No, you know what? Just three scoops
of orange sherbet and two spoons.

566
00:33:07,073 --> 00:33:09,308
The colors are bright
and cheerful.

567
00:33:09,343 --> 00:33:11,945
The kids have candy.
Full bar for mom and dad.

568
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:14,548
Would you say it's
a delightful destination?

569
00:33:14,582 --> 00:33:16,584
It's not a destination.

570
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:19,319
It's on the way to someplace.

571
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:22,422
That's true.
It's a long car drive.

572
00:33:22,457 --> 00:33:24,791
Mom probably needs
to use the restroom.

573
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:26,993
Kids get a look at the place,

574
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:29,229
force them to stay.

575
00:33:29,263 --> 00:33:31,830
You like to work,
but I can't like to work?

576
00:33:33,967 --> 00:33:36,134
You should have told me
if it was so important to you.

577
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:38,136
- We didn't have to go.
- I never got the chance.

578
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,873
It was in front of everyone.
And it's embarrassing.

579
00:33:40,907 --> 00:33:43,676
I ruined the whole damn thing by
pulling you off that crack team.

580
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,678
I am on the team.

581
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:47,847
- Here we go.
- She's never tried it.

582
00:33:47,882 --> 00:33:50,450
- You're kidding.
- Try it.

583
00:33:57,492 --> 00:33:59,993
Oh, no, sorry.

584
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:02,629
- It's not for everybody.
- It tastes like perfume to me.

585
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,331
That's why we make 28 flavors.

586
00:34:04,365 --> 00:34:06,433
<i>Can I get a scoop of chocolate?</i>

587
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:11,171
Really?

588
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:12,839
I don't like it.

589
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:15,008
There's no chance you're
trying to embarrass me?

590
00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:18,211
You're right.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

591
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:22,849
Mmm, it's so delicious.

592
00:34:22,884 --> 00:34:24,551
Mm-Mmm!

593
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:27,621
Mm, it's so good.

594
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:29,122
Stop it.

595
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,259
What's wrong with you?

596
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:35,797
I'm sorry. Maybe you could
make up a little schedule

597
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:38,032
so I'll know when I'm working
and when I'm your wife.

598
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,534
It gets so confusing.

599
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:42,102
I know, I'm terrible.
Making you eat ice cream.

600
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:45,005
Why don't you call
your mother and hurl

601
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,208
a string of complaints at her
in French like you always do?

602
00:34:48,243 --> 00:34:50,877
- I'm always talking about you.
- The woman speaks English.

603
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:52,745
Why don't you call your mother?

604
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:00,986
Don.

605
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:07,460
Do not walk away from me.

606
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:11,398
- Get in the car.
- No, I am talking to you.

607
00:35:11,432 --> 00:35:13,634
Okay, don't get in the car.

608
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:16,202
( Scoffs ) Go ahead.

609
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:20,174
You care more what some truck stop
waitress thinks than what I say.

610
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,678
Get in the car.
Eat ice cream.

611
00:35:23,712 --> 00:35:25,513
Leave work.
Take off your dress.

612
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:27,549
- Yes, master.
- ( Engine starts )

613
00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:33,623
Don't you dare pull away!
I'm talking to you.

614
00:35:33,657 --> 00:35:35,692
<i>( Tires squeal )</i>

615
00:36:22,602 --> 00:36:25,405
Excuse me.
Was my wife just in here?

616
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:27,807
- She was.
- Where'd she go?

617
00:36:27,842 --> 00:36:30,376
- I don't know.
- To the hotel?

618
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:32,712
She was talking to
those fellas over there.

619
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:34,680
They all left.

620
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:37,082
They went towards
the parking lot together.

621
00:36:37,116 --> 00:36:39,418
I thought she
was looking for you.

622
00:37:10,182 --> 00:37:13,151
Wow, you're really
checking the place out.

623
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:15,388
I've got your room key.

624
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:16,989
Do you want help
with your bags?

625
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,725
No. Did you give
my wife a key?

626
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,694
No. Do you want
another key?

627
00:37:22,497 --> 00:37:24,665
No.
I-- No.

628
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:27,534
Uh, I have some bad news.

00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:30,169
- What?
- We closed the pool.

630
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:32,305
Some kid had an accident.

631
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,707
I swear it doesn't
happen a lot.

632
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:05,571
- Oh, you took care of me, sir.
- No, can I get some dimes?

633
00:38:05,606 --> 00:38:07,440
Oh, le will let you
use the phone.

634
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:08,707
That's okay.
Pay phone's fine.

635
00:38:08,742 --> 00:38:10,675
It's none of my business,

636
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,811
but couples fight in here
all the time.

637
00:38:12,845 --> 00:38:14,812
There's no reason
to think the worst.

638
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:17,081
She probably got a ride
home with those kids.

get any calls. Did you get any calls?

- About what?
- Has anyone called you?

642

Hello, it's Don.

<i>Hello.</i>
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

649
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:03,328
Just wanted to call...

650
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:05,964
to say hello

651
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:08,634
and wanted to know
if Megan had called you.

<i>Has Megan called</i>
<i>me tonight? No.</i>

No. Huh.

<i>Don, are you still there?</i>

655
00:39:15,476 --> 00:39:18,312
Well, I wanted to buy her
some jewelry

656
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:21,849
and I remembered that she had
an allergic reaction to metal,

657
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:24,018
but I don't remember
if it's silver or gold.

Well, good.

<i>What a fine husband you are.</i>
<i>It is only gold alloy--</i>

Listen, Marie,
if she does call...

662
00:39:37,432 --> 00:39:39,132
Don't ruin the surprise, okay?

663
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,467
- <i>Of course. Of course not.</i>
- Thank you.

664
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:44,670
Okay.
<i>Au revoir.</i>

Are you okay?

668
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:57,751
I'm sorry to do
that to you, sir,

669
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:00,121
but they don't let patrons

No, no, of course not.

Well, my wife, she--

675
00:40:14,972 --> 00:40:17,640
She's missing.
She took off from here.

676
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:20,210
- When was this?
- I don't know.

677
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:25,115
Almost seven hours ago.

678
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:28,719
Well, I'll be back
and forth here all morning.

the Hutchinson river
parkway to 95.

You cold?

684

It's like I'm in shock.

Where are we going?

687
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:25,970
To your new house.

688
00:41:26,004 --> 00:41:28,473
I don't want to go there.

689
00:41:28,507 --> 00:41:30,942
I don't want vacation to end.

690

Me either.

691

When can we go back?

wake up, I'll tell you.

You keep telling her
to stop singing it.

Six and a half hours on a bus.

And then try getting a cab at Port
Authority at 5:00 in the morning.
