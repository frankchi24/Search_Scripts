Still I expect pragmatism from you...

4
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:07,945
We share that...

5
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:11,430
I just keep thinking about
what's going on here and I miss it.

6
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,677
I say we put it to a vote.

7
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,116
I say we step outside.

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,271
Allison and Faye Miller and
who knows how many more...

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,171
I'm going to be with
you until I die.

10
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:22,091
How's not your wife
dropping you off?

11
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,856
There was a time when she
wouldn't leave the house in a robe.

12
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:29,042
There's a point when you go from
going home on the 5:25 to the 7:05.

The first half of a football
match is just flirting.

30
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:02,957
Well, I'd like to get there,

31
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:05,292
grab a nice seat,
enjoy the chitchat.

perhaps a ride in the boats

Spending an afternoon in

One: They're your friends,
and recent ones at that.

watching football.
Three--

- You love football.
- No, that's my father.

40
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:33,719
And I hate this business

41
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:35,921
of bringing england
over in pieces.

42
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:37,289
It's strictly for the homesick.

43
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:40,392
But it's filled with
immigrants like us.

How lovely your face becomes when
you tell me you need something.

00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:50,735
I'd be happy if you'd just
pretend to have a good time.

47
00:03:50,803 --> 00:03:54,138
Then pretend I shall.

to make a pledge

53
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:22,297
that this is the end
of football for some time.

54

We beat the bloody Jerries
for the world cup, darling.

55
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:27,870
That is the end of football.

56
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:29,871
I'll believe that
when I see it.

57
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,405
Is Lane this way about that?

58

Perhaps at one time.

59
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,176

Are you an account man at the firm?

No, financial chief.

65
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:49,823
You should have one
give me a call.

66
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:51,659
Well, my name's on the door.

they don't seem to be concerned

70
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:02,935
I find New York
better than London

71
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,206
because 50 miles away, things
are infinitely more wholesome.

- Unless you have plans.

80
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,964
Oh, no.
It's Cynthia's uncle.

81
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,500
He's trying to break into radio.
I'm gonna try and talk him out of it.

I'd love to meet him.

83

- Roger?
- Nope.

00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:59,389
- Pete?
- No.

90
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:01,458
- Mr. Cooper?
- No, dear.

91
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:03,427
- Don?
- Nope.

92
00:06:03,494 --> 00:06:04,961
Very well, then.

93
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:06,696
If there are any addendums
for the minutes,

94
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:08,264
please give them
to me by 4:00.

95
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:10,466
Excuse me, gentlemen.
If I may.

96
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:12,401
I have a bit of new business.

97
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:16,071
- Taking leave again?
- Not at all.

98
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,108
I don't know if you're aware,

99
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,343
but England won the World Cup.

100
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,910
Cup of what?

101
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:26,748
Anyway, I've begun a bit of a
friendship with Edwin Baker,

102
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,417
senior vice president
of public relations

103
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:32,186
for Jaguar cars incorporated.

104
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:35,323
Completely unprovoked,
he made it clear

105
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,626
that since their impending
merger with BMC,

106
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:41,362
they're looking
for a new agency

107
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:43,497
to break them
into the American market.

108
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:45,599
Dinner is set.

109
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,768
- Yowza!
- Spectacular.

110
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:49,703
- Roger: <i>I want one.</i>
- So, Mr. Pryce,

111
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:52,205
- that's Jaguar, like the cat?
- Indeed.

112
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:55,207
Why are you smiling?

113
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:58,244
Jaguar, well, we'd probably
have to hire 10 people

114
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:00,012
who will be on
the payroll for months.

115
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,648
Are you sure we can afford it?

116
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:04,216
My lordy.
New business.

117
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:05,752
Not here, sir.

118
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,921
I suppose if you brought in
an account of this stature,

119
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:10,855
I might said
something different.

120
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:13,224
It's $3 million, tops.

121
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:15,059
It's a car and you know it.

122
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,429
You know, I'd be happy
to ride shotgun.

123
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:20,165
If nothing else, I could pick up the
check and make you look important.

124
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,033
I think that would make
you look important.

125
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:24,403
But, honestly, Lane,
if you want any of us along,

126
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,304
Cooper speaks British.

127
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:29,239
I believe Edwin and I
relate to one another

128
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:31,776
on matters both business
and personal.

129
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:33,778
Englishman to Englishman.

130
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:37,114
I love that car.

131
00:07:42,353 --> 00:07:44,187
Should someone give
him a few pointers?

132
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,790
- That's a good idea.
- I'm terribly busy.

133
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:48,591
- Roger.
- I'd be glad to.

134
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:55,732
Oh, Don.
Just a minute.

135
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,967
Trudy dictated directions
to Clara for Saturday night.

136
00:07:59,035 --> 00:08:01,169
I promise, no charades,
no bridge,

137
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:03,238
just good home cooking
and drinks.

138
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:05,173
This Saturday
I think we're going away.

139
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,675
I doubt that.

140
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:08,410
Trudy will only act
on a certainty.

141
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,011
Okay.

142
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,814
Thank you.

143
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:15,950
- ( Sighs ) Dawn, can you get Mrs. Draper?
- She's inside.

144
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,521
I'm almost done.

145
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:23,558
So, I want you to call your new
best friend Trudy Campbell

146
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,593
and tell her that we're
unavailable this weekend.

147
00:08:25,661 --> 00:08:27,462
You already said
we were coming.

148
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:28,929
To who?

149
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:31,264
I don't know.
Trudy said you did.

150
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:33,299
Well, she got this far
by subterfuge.

151
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:35,469
She won't feel bad when
you pull the plug on it.

152
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:37,170
I like her.

153
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:39,606
I like her, too.
But Saturday night in the suburbs?

154
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:41,475
That's when you really want
to blow your brains out.

155
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,910
If you want to tell her,
you call her.

156
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,516
Hey, where's Stan and Ginsberg?

157
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:53,185
Why? Do you have something
you want to tell them?

158
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:54,553
No.

159
00:08:58,157 --> 00:08:59,958
Listen,
about this morning--

160
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:02,260
- I thought we had a pact.
- It's not about the pact.

161
00:09:02,327 --> 00:09:04,962
It has nothing to do with the pact.
The pact still stands.

162
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,631
Then why didn't you
introduce me?

163
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:08,266
I'm a copywriter.
I'm not gonna take your job.

164
00:09:10,969 --> 00:09:13,237
I'd love a shred of privacy.
Just a shred.

165
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:15,206
You know?
Is that too much to ask?

166
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:17,375
( Sighs )

167
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:19,943
Okay, listen.

168
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,145
You know I write stories.

169
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,014
You're still doing that?

170
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,450
Well, I decided
to fly under the radar.

171
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:30,521
I have a nom de plume and, well,
I've had quite a bit of success

172
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:33,290
in a particular genre
and he's from Farrar Straus.

173
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:36,358
Wow, that's exciting.

174
00:09:36,427 --> 00:09:37,993
I guess.

175
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:40,029
Cynthia's trying to talk
them into taking the best 20

176
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:41,497
and turning them
into a collection.

177
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,467
20?
When do you do this?

178
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:46,969
I started turning most
of my dinners into drinks.

179
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:50,505
And if I have only one, I'm in
pretty good shape when I get home.

180
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:54,108
So, what is it?

181
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,145
It's between fantasy
and science fiction.

182
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:59,748
Robots and planets and things.
There's whole magazines.

183
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,317
No, I mean what's
your pen name?

184
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:05,719
Fine.
It's Ben Hargrove.

185
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,189
Anyway, I could have
introduced you,

186
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:11,525
and that was wrong,
but I just...

187
00:10:11,593 --> 00:10:13,561
I don't know.

188
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:16,596
Well, I wish
I felt more relieved.

189
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:19,666
It's probably not gonna happen.

190
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,401
And listen,
the pact still stands.

191
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:23,003
If I go anywhere,
you go with me.

192
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:24,804
Okay.

193
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:32,178
So that's some big news.

194
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:34,513
Are you here to put in
a good word for yourself?

195
00:10:34,581 --> 00:10:37,350
No.
A little bird told med

196
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,453
you got an RFP from Jaguar.
And that is a very good sign.

197
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,288
Yes, I was just going over it.

198
00:10:48,827 --> 00:10:52,130
Request for proposal.
Jaguar. Blah, blah.

199
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:55,100
"One, have you ever
been fired off an account?"

200
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,901
There are worse ones than that.

201
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:03,508
Would you take a little bit
of unsolicited advice?

202
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,645
It's not pride that's
keeping me from asking.

203
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:10,214
I certainly am aware that
you're skilled in this arena.

204
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:11,849
I was.

205
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:14,752
Now I guess I'm professor
emeritus of accounts.

206
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,088
Look, most people will tell you
it's hard to make a mistake.

207
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:19,789
I mean, you just lie.

208
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:21,024
But that won't
get you anywhere.

209
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:25,729
The beauty of this dinner
is that if you do it right,

210
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:28,398
you can actually have him
tell you all the answers.

211
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:31,167
In fact, I once got a guy from Dr.
Scholl's to fill it out for me.

212
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:34,504
( Chuckles ) There'll
be plenty of drinks.

213
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,839
Not for you.
You order a scotch, rocks and water.

214
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:38,941
You drink half of it
till it turns see-through.

215
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,545
- You get another.
- Very good.

216
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:45,380
And then, well, then it's
kind of like being on a date.

217
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:47,049
Flattery, I suppose.

218
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:49,251
Within reason.

219
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:51,786
But I find it's best
to smile and sit there

220
00:11:51,854 --> 00:11:54,856
like you've got no place
to go and just let them talk.

221
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:58,426
Somewhere in the middle of the entree,
they'll throw out something revealing.

222
00:11:58,493 --> 00:12:00,662
And you want to wait till
dessert to pounce on it.

223
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:02,430
You know, let them
know you've got

224
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,532
the same problem he has,
whatever it is.

225
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,435
And then you're in
a conspiracy.

226
00:12:07,502 --> 00:12:10,271
The basis of
a "friendship."

227
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,540
Then you whip out the form.

228
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,575
What if I don't have
the same problem?

229
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:16,510
It'll probably
just be something like

230
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:18,512
he drinks too much, he gambles.

231
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,281
I once went on
a five-minute tear

232
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:22,349
about how my mother loved
my father more than me.

233
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,017
And I can assure you
that is impossible.

234
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:26,219
Very good, then.

235
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,621
And if, for some reason,
he's more reserved?

236
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:30,590
Just reverse it.

237
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:32,525
Feed him your own
personal morsel.

238
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:34,927
Oh, I see.

239
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:38,831
That's it.

240
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,266
Get your answers,
be nice to the waiter,

241
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:42,767
and don't let him
near the check.

242
00:12:42,835 --> 00:12:45,170
Thank you very much.

243
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:48,073
Oh, and find out everything you can
about him before you get there.

244
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:50,041
- That I've done.
- And you still like him?

245
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,611
- I do.
- Let it show.

246
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:00,084
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i>I finally got Mrs. Campbell on the line.</i>

247
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:05,189
Trudy, I'm glad I got
a hold of you.

248
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:07,825
- I have some bad news.
- No, you don't.

249
00:13:07,892 --> 00:13:09,827
We're building the whole
party around you.

250
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:12,329
You see, I'm afraid
we're not free.

251
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:14,498
Don, do you want to go down
your list of excuses

252
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:16,366
and I'll combat each one
individually?

253
00:13:16,434 --> 00:13:18,335
Or should we just skip
to the end?

254
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:21,037
If you can't make it Saturday,
I will reschedule.

255
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:22,639
It's going to happen.

256
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:24,774
And I promise you'll have
a good time.

257
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:27,310
It's too bad your husband
can't close a deal like this.

258
00:13:27,378 --> 00:13:29,711
We both know he's doing
just fine.

259
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,280
7:30.

260
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:34,883
( Gasps ) Who's hungry?

261
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,059
Are you okay?

262
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,128
I saw you getting
a little green in there.

263
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:49,797
Those movies are gruesome.

264
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:52,500
I think we should go
back to riding horses.

265
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:54,935
( Chuckles ) That must
have been something.

266
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:57,205
Why don't you
have a license yet?

267
00:13:57,273 --> 00:13:59,207
I grew up in Manhattan.

268
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,907
Just wasn't necessary.

269
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,609
I like going down to the city.

270
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:04,878
There's so much to do.

271
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:07,347
Well, maybe you'll move
there when you get older.

272
00:14:07,415 --> 00:14:10,917
Then you'll get married
and you'll move back here.

273
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:14,020
I'm not getting married
until after college...

274
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:16,455
If my parents still let me go.

275
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,057
What?

276
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,859
Didn't you hear
about the sniper

277
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,761
at the University
of Texas today?

278
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,698
Aren't you going to Ohio State?
It doesn't matter.

279
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,767
Just two weeks after
those nurses in Chicago--

280
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,504
They don't want me
out there by myself.

281
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:34,339
Don't let them scare you.

282
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:36,374
I don't know.

283
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,414
Things seem so random
all of a sudden.

284
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,785
And time feels like
it's speeding up.

285
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,786
It does,

286
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:52,055
doesn't it?

287
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:56,159
I remember when the summer seemed
as long as the school year.

288
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,597
I used to go every spring
to the botanical gardens.

289
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:03,133
And this year, look,
it's already August.

290
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:05,868
In the Bronx?
My family donated some of that.

291
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:09,272
- Really?
- Well, generations ago.

292
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,608
We should go some Sunday soon.

293
00:15:11,675 --> 00:15:13,743
We'd be VIPs

294
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,145
Who's going to drive?

295
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:19,249
We'll take turns.
Give each other lessons.

296
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:25,086
- <i>( Door opens )</i>
- Man: <i>Okay, that's 15 minutes, everybody.</i>

297
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:26,888
<i>Back to the salt mines.</i>

298
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:28,990
We should go back in.

299
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,226
Don't want to miss the mayhem.

300
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:43,571
What's Ken's wife's name?

301
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,974
I can't remember.

302
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,576
She sent me the nicest
thank-you card for the party.

303
00:15:50,112 --> 00:15:51,946
Why don't you wear
the sport coat I got you?

304
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:54,047
It's the country.

305
00:15:54,115 --> 00:15:55,749
You should slow down.

306
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:57,617
I'm timing this
for when we arrive.

307
00:15:57,685 --> 00:15:59,686
I want to hit the doorbell
with my chin.

308
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:01,755
You know, this could be fun.

309
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:03,223
How's that work?

310
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,992
You don't think there's
any chance you could

311
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:07,161
have a conversation with
another couple as friends?

312
00:16:07,228 --> 00:16:08,895
What about your actor friends?

313
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:10,529
I don't think
there was any business

314
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:12,865
or financial realities
discussed the whole time.

315
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:16,169
Don, I had to invite your
accountant to your birthday party.

316
00:16:16,236 --> 00:16:18,570
Frank's been very
important to me, okay?

317
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:25,476
You're driving.
Now go change.

318
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,380
<i>( Classical music playing )</i>

319
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,883
Incredible, right?

320
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:35,120
We keep expecting to open the doors
and see a tiny orchestra in there.

321
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:38,356
- That would be amazing.
- ( Chuckles )

322
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,725
And it's a beautiful
piece of furniture.

323
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:42,759
It's seven feet long.

324
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,429
Wilt Chamberlain could
lie down in there.

325
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:47,264
Why would he want to do that?

326
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:49,733
The hostess would like you
to turn down the stereo

327
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,735
for fear of waking
a nonessential guest.

328
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,670
( Lowers volume )

329
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:56,006
I told her she's not allowed to
talk about the baby tonight.

330
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:58,241
<i>( Knocking )</i>

331
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,043
Terrific.
That's him.

332
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:05,148
- Welcome.
- I'm sorry we're late.

333
00:17:05,216 --> 00:17:07,283
You know I can't
blame the directions.

334
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:10,186
- You have a lovely home.
- You haven't seen it.

335
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:13,021
But it is certainly graced by
the addition of the Cosgroves.

336
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,290
It's nice to see you, Don.

337
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:17,392
Well, hello, you.

338
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:23,332
I see a familiar red tin.

339
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:25,433
Brownies from
William Greenberg.

340
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,203
Well, hello and welcome.

341
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:31,939
You look lovely, Trudy.

342
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,741
We did it, didn't we?
We got them together.

343
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:35,576
Tweety, look what they brought.

344
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:36,878
Doesn't it make you homesick?

345
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:38,946
I'm sorry there are no bakeries

346
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:41,548
or Greenbergs in Cos Cob.

347
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:44,352
Can we put them in the icebox?
Could everyone try it my way?

348
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:46,887
I'm going to devil some eggs
if the girls want to help.

349
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:48,421
Megan, you want to take
Don's drink order?

350
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:49,822
Big and brown.

351
00:17:49,891 --> 00:17:52,092
Trudy, I love your touch.

352
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:53,927
It's almost rustic.
Am I wrong?

353
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:56,396
That may take longer
than you like.

354
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,565
Ken just handed it to me.

355
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:02,467
Do you like the music?

356
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:04,603
I do.

357
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,039
You know, I've never lived
on the ground floor before.

358
00:18:07,107 --> 00:18:08,673
And we don't share any walls,

359
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:10,542
so I can make it
as loud as I want.

360
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,045
But we're not gonna.
Trudy has ground rules.

361
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:14,947
No work talk, no baby talk.

362
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:16,415
And you get the big steak.

363
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:18,349
Excuse me?

364
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:20,952
Look,

365
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,955
I'm not gonna pretend it's not a
big deal to us that you came out.

366
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:26,024
Oh, come on.

367
00:18:26,091 --> 00:18:27,392
We're long overdue.

368
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:33,997
I remember asking you
over to dinner

369
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:36,099
when we first got married.

370
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,135
That was another lifetime.

371
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:41,004
- Well, at least for me.
- ( Laughs )

372
00:18:42,473 --> 00:18:45,475
Mmm, beef's brilliant,

373
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:47,945
but it would be difficult to
do those tomatoes one better.

374
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:52,114
Ever done any gardening?

375
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:55,151
- No.
- Well, I'm quite keen on it now.

376
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,554
Three years in north Africa,
scarcely a blade of grass,

377
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:00,189
living like a dog.

378
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:02,391
Yes.

379
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:06,027
I've heard men talk with dark
permanence about those years.

380
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:07,963
Not me.

381
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,131
Best days of my life.

382
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,600
Oh, well,

383
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:15,536
then I suppose
you must miss it.

384
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:17,439
You must have some melancholy.

385
00:19:17,506 --> 00:19:20,842
No, it's just how
I associate with my youth.

386
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,045
What about your war?

387
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:28,449
I volunteered for combat
on numerous occasions,

388
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:31,918
but spent most of the war as a
supply assistant in Rosyth.

389
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:34,154
Well, everyone
played their part.

390
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:36,457
That was britain at its best.

391
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:38,157
Yes.

392
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:44,364
So I'm glad to hear that
America has been good for you.

393
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:47,266
And your wife
is pleased, I assume?

394
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:49,768
I'll be honest with you, Lane.

395
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:53,872
I haven't a complaint
in the world.

396
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:56,674
Well, that's too bad, isn't it?

397
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,576
( Laughs )

398
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:06,359
So the Coe family claims it was them.
Coes' Cob.

399
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:09,463
Which became through
yankee arrogance Cos Cob.

400
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:12,733
Of course, it also sounds a lot like
the Algonquin word for briefcase.

401
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:14,334
( Laughs )

402
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:16,804
Ken, where have you and--

403
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:19,204
Where have you two
made your home?

404
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:21,206
We're in Jackson
Heights, Queens.

405
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:23,743
It's very down to earth.
A lot of workers.

406
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:25,912
I keep telling them
to move out to the country.

407
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:27,847
Well, we both work in the city

408
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:29,849
and my parents
aren't like Trudy's.

409
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:31,851
Help from them comes with a
lot of strings attached.

410
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,018
It is beautiful out here.

411
00:20:34,086 --> 00:20:37,055
The air is so fresh and all
the trees and the grass.

412
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:38,790
I grew up in rural Vermont.

413
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:41,860
Kids throwing their bikes on the
front lawn is not the country to me.

414
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:44,329
You miss the horse shit, huh?

415
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:46,364
( All laugh )

416
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:47,933
Don!

417
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,501
I grew up in the country,
too, and I don't miss walking

418
00:20:50,569 --> 00:20:52,169
to an outhouse in
the middle of winter.

419
00:20:52,236 --> 00:20:55,372
Well, it's more
civilized than that.

420
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,407
But there are a lot
of varmints.

421
00:20:58,677 --> 00:21:00,310
You should bring
that rifle home.

422
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:03,948
You still have that?
There will be no gun in this house.

423
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:07,283
I never liked them.
And now with that Charles Whitmore.

424
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,318
Whitman.

425
00:21:09,386 --> 00:21:11,120
They say he had a brain tumor.

426
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,722
He kept warning everyone.

427
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,858
Without a gun would he
be able to kill his wife

428
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,626
and mom and 20 other people?

429
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:18,495
I'm sorry.

430
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:20,396
It's the hostess' prerogative
to change the subject.

431
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:22,531
Trudy, it bears discussion.

432
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:25,033
One rifle for shooting
gophers is not the same

433
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:28,103
as a frustrated ex-marine
shooting at pregnant ladies.

434
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,671
You know, Kenny predicted it.

435
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:31,473
He wrote a story that
was exactly like that.

436
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,609
- Don't, Cynthia.
- Cynthia!

437
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:34,710
What?

438
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:39,079
Nothing, I just...

439
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:42,917
- Honey, they don't want to talk about that.
- Why not?

440
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:45,319
You know, if he wasn't a writer,
we never would have met.

441
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,623
- I didn't know that.
- I work in publishing.

442
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,259
My boss was rejecting him and I
thought it was all he could handle.

443
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,761
( Laughing )

444
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,732
What was the story?

445
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,935
- Forget it.
- No, we want to know.

446
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,372
It's called
"The Punishment Of X4."

447
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,742
There's this bridge
between these two planets

448
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:12,411
and thousands of humans
travel on it every day.

449
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:16,048
And so there's this robot;
he does maintenance on the bridge.

450
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:20,019
And one day, he removes a bolt

451
00:22:20,086 --> 00:22:22,755
and the bridge collapses
and everyone dies.

452
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,762
There's more to it
than that, you know.

453
00:22:30,829 --> 00:22:33,397
But it's just a story.

454
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:35,232
Why does he do it?

455
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,268
Because he's a robot.

456
00:22:37,335 --> 00:22:39,003
Those people
tell him what to do

457
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:41,005
and he doesn't have the
power to make any decisions

458
00:22:41,106 --> 00:22:43,507
except he can decide whether
that bolt's on or off.

459
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,244
Or he just hates commuters.

460
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:49,746
( All laugh )

461
00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:51,549
How long have you been writing?

462
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:53,551
I started screwing around
in high school.

463
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:56,753
And by the time I got a job,
I thought it would go away.

464
00:22:56,854 --> 00:22:59,021
And it mostly has.

465
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,424
No one grows awaiting
to be an advertising.

466
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:04,694
Oh, that's not true.
It's such an interesting profession to me..

467
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:06,429
What are you to it, Megan?

468
00:23:06,497 --> 00:23:08,631
Megan came to
New York as an actress.

469
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:12,034
If trying to be an actress
is being an actress.

470
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:14,970
That's fascinating.
I could see it.

471
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:18,273
But I had been in a few
agencies on auditions

472
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:21,310
and it looked like a fun
place to get the bills paid.

473
00:23:21,377 --> 00:23:24,045
And I saw what Don
and Peggy did

474
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:26,115
and I saw a future
for myself in it.

475
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:27,483
That's the truth.

476
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,220
Can I interest anyone
in dessert and coffee?

477
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,255
- Hot or iced?
- Yes to dessert.

478
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,491
Still having too much
fun for coffee.

479
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,601
People talk about how there's
so much crime in the city.

480
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,069
I was ripped off by the kid
who mows my lawn.

481
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:51,805
Yes, they used to take my beer
out of the fridge in the garage.

482
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:54,642
A fridge in the garage?
That's a good idea.

483
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,309
<i>( Men shriek, laugh )</i>

484
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:03,116
Damn it.
I'll get the toolbox.

485
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:05,718
I turned it on and it
just blew in my face.

486
00:24:07,387 --> 00:24:08,888
Hold this.

487
00:24:10,891 --> 00:24:12,659
Don, what are you doing?

488
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:15,762
Look, it's Superman.

489
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:25,336
- <i>( Baby crying )</i>
- Oh, good lord.

490
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:49,193
( Applause )

491
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:54,831
What was wrong?

492
00:24:54,899 --> 00:24:57,600
The supply was turned all the way up.
It forces the valve.

493
00:24:57,668 --> 00:25:00,403
- But it stopped the leak.
- That was a coincidence.

494
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,173
Grab Don's shirt.
I'll throw it in the dryer.

495
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,742
Aren't we supposed to say
something about that baby?

496
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,210
- Look at her.
- What an angel.

497
00:25:14,217 --> 00:25:17,352
I take no credit
for her at all.

498
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,354
- <i>( Baby cries )</i>
- Cynthia: <i>Aw!</i>

499
00:25:21,657 --> 00:25:23,357
I'm gonna close my eyes.

500
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:25,927
And when I open them
I want to see skyscrapers.

501
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:28,096
Admit it, you had a great time.

502
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:33,567
I'm too drunk for you to drive.

503
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:35,870
We should pull over
and both sober up.

504
00:25:35,938 --> 00:25:38,539
<i>( Unzips )</i>

505
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:40,874
Let's make a baby.

506
00:25:40,942 --> 00:25:43,210
No, that's impossible.

507
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:44,845
What, isn't that
how this works?

508
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:47,680
A baby gets you going?

509
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:52,786
Just pull over.
This brassiere is like Fort Knox.

510
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:02,862
The only reason
you're getting anywhere

511
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:04,830
is because Pete scared
the shit out of me

512
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,466
with his car
accident statistics

513
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:11,770
and because I can't believe

514
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,639
how much I loved watching
you fix that sink.

515
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:23,815
Pete: Because there
was a plane crash.

516
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,516
And it doesn't matter that
it's not one of Mohawk's.

517
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,950
We should stop
running ads for a week

518
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,418
and then just hope
that no one notices

519
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,320
that Mohawk has 10 planes
that are the same model.

520
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,923
Why? There's a plane crash
every day in Vietnam.

521
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,224
There were seven yesterday.
It's Braniff, for Christ's sake.

522
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,859
Let them eat their
award-winning work.

523
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:39,296
- ( Knocks )
- Ask Lane.

524
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:41,631
- Yes?
- Do what you want. It's your account.

525
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:44,867
Hey, Heathcliff.
How was your date?

526
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:47,737
Lane here got Lord Jaguar
to unravel the mysteries of the RFP.

527
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:50,306
Yes, about that...

528
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:52,909
Unfortunately, I was forced

529
00:26:52,976 --> 00:26:55,778
to do the plan in reverse,
as you suggested.

530
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:59,182
I even offered that Rebecca
was unbalanced

531
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:01,583
in an effort to attempt
to lull him into confession,

532
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,286
but to no avail.

533
00:27:03,353 --> 00:27:05,554
- Oh.
- What plan?

534
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:07,622
Anyway, I've primed him
for another dinner

535
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,125
when all should be revealed
and it's on the books.

536
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:11,726
That's not what
I told you to do.

537
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:14,196
Lane, I think Roger and I,
and probably Don,

538
00:27:14,263 --> 00:27:16,898
should take your friend out to a
dinner which is strictly business.

539
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:19,634
<i>Ask all the rough questions,</i>
<i>brag about you,</i>

540
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:21,636
then allow you to swoop in,

541
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:24,071
his new best friend,
and shine the chrome.

542
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:26,440
I don't know if
that's necessary.

543
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:30,211
Roger, tell him that's
the way the plan always works.

544
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:32,313
Sure.

545
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,514
You wouldn't want to hit
a golf ball off the tee

546
00:27:34,582 --> 00:27:36,083
when you could hit
it from the green.

547
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:38,784
We need you to stay a pure friend.
Practice your putting.

548
00:27:41,155 --> 00:27:42,688
Very well, then.

549
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:49,863
That was generous.

550
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,831
Come on, Lane couldn't
close a car door.

551
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:54,799
- I mean inviting me along.
- I'm inviting you to dinner,

552
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,668
not the wedding night.

553
00:28:11,283 --> 00:28:12,683
How are you?

554
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:15,086
I think I'm hungover.

555
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:17,021
What? Really?

556
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:19,590
Belinda and I were left
alone in the drugstore

557
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,493
and she opened up a bottle
of vanilla extract.

558
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:26,062
It did make the afternoon
go faster,

559
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,131
but now I have a headache.

560
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,766
Sounds like my office.

561
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,734
( Chuckles )

562
00:28:31,802 --> 00:28:33,736
Well, now that you're sober,

563
00:28:33,804 --> 00:28:35,939
I will remind you
that you promised

564
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,440
to find a Sunday
for the gardens.

565
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,977
What about church?

566
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:42,912
God's all over the gardens.

567
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:46,315
- Hi.
- Hey.

568
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:49,385
I missed a couple classes,
but I'm here from now on.

569
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:51,186
No, he's not the instructor.

570
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:53,322
He's Peter.

571
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,591
- Who are you?
- I'm Jenny Gunther.

572
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:59,760
- Chemistry.
- Right.

573
00:28:59,828 --> 00:29:02,297
You're handsome, aren't you?

574
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:04,198
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

575
00:29:04,266 --> 00:29:05,833
Your name is handsome?

576
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:07,668
No, my name is hanson,

577
00:29:07,736 --> 00:29:10,738
but everybody calls me that.
( Clears throat )

578
00:29:10,806 --> 00:29:13,441
So I got to be some kind of
weirdo that I don't remember you.

579
00:29:13,508 --> 00:29:15,442
It was a big class.

580
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:18,445
There were a lot of girls.

581
00:29:18,512 --> 00:29:20,113
- <i>So what are you doing next year?</i>
- Ohio State.

582
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:26,219
Billy Josephs and I were supposed
to join up, but my dad went ape.

583
00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:28,088
He wouldn't let me
drive, either.

584
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:31,523
So I'm gonna follow through on that
track scholarship to Holy Cross.

585
00:29:34,955 --> 00:29:37,991
I think a man getting out of a
Jaguar needs a cold shower.

586
00:29:38,058 --> 00:29:40,294
That's it--
A singular message

587
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,961
repeated over and over again.

588
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:45,864
The Jaguar XKE is pornographic.

589
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:50,202
Is that enough of a flavor?

590
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,438
Gentlemen,

591
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:56,241
not that I don't appreciate
the all-hands-on-deck,

592
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,678
but I think the cause
of our friendship

593
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:01,680
would be best served
by us having a little fun.

594
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:04,015
Oh, fun.

595
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:07,852
Well, you know that I have every
intention of giving you this business.

596
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,357
I just wanted to make sure that
I enjoy the people I work with.

597
00:30:12,425 --> 00:30:14,225
We'd love to show you
a good time.

598
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:16,160
I'm surprised Lane
didn't offer.

599
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:19,663
I don't think Mr. Pryce and I
have the same taste in this area.

600
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:21,565
We should go grab
a drink at the Carlyle.

601
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:23,200
It's a good place
to get into trouble.

602
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:25,168
You understand
I'm not visiting.

603
00:30:25,236 --> 00:30:27,504
I reside here in New York.

604
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:31,442
Roger, I believe this is
your opportunity to shine.

605
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:36,212
You know what?
I have a friend

606
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,614
who's having a party
right around the corner.

607
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,850
Oh.

608
00:30:40,917 --> 00:30:43,853
I like parties.

609
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,921
- <i>( Music playing )</i>
- ( Laughing )

610
00:30:49,525 --> 00:30:51,493
I said we're from out of town.

611
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:54,162
Now give me one attraction that isn't
in this room right in front of me.

612
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,197
What happened to your friend?

613
00:30:56,265 --> 00:30:58,767
Because the last word I want to hear
out of his date's mouth is next.

614
00:30:58,835 --> 00:31:01,403
Anastasia, he likes you.

615
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,073
Listen, honey.

616
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,708
I'm not gonna bore you
with compliments.

617
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,678
What about your friend?

618
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:13,414
Jesus, Don, even in this place
you're doing better than us.

619
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:19,086
Well, someone got lucky.

620
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:21,788
I think one of your sorority
sisters isn't very picky.

621
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,825
Come on, Don.
Work, work, work.

622
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:29,161
Do you think you could lift me?

623
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:34,033
That's what I thought.

624
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,968
You're one of those guys
who's stronger than he looks.

625
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,541
I want some rum, but I
think it's in my room.

626
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,525
( Laughs )

627
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:06,131
Easy, tiger.
I don't do this by the minute.

( Chuckles )

629
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,335
You think this
is gonna be easy?

630
00:32:11,403 --> 00:32:13,570
I do.

631
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:15,572
I really do.

632
00:32:31,855 --> 00:32:35,157
You any good at this or not?

633
00:32:35,224 --> 00:32:38,026
Oh, honey.

634
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:41,129
You've had such a hard day.

635
00:32:41,197 --> 00:32:43,265
Nope.

636
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:47,402
Um...

637
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,904
This is my first time.

638
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:52,139
I'm kind of nervous.

639
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:54,075
Nope.

640
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:02,750
You're my king.

641
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:04,618
Okay.

642
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,501
I suppose you know that officer
Logan says to say hello.

643
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:23,636
I'm not a cop.

644
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:26,305
Are you interested in
someone who's already busy?

645
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:28,608
Just waiting for my friends.

646
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:32,011
Well, if there's something
you can't find here,

647
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:34,213
a friend of mine
has an apartment.

648
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,047
Maybe more what
you're looking for

649
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,449
and he's walking distance.

650
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,653
That's the best
I've ever seen that done.

651
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:43,722
Does that happen to you a lot?

652
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:46,224
No. I grew up
in a place like this.

653
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,727
There's no other
place like this.

654
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:50,495
You're right.
It wasn't as nice.

655
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:52,195
We called it a whorehouse.

656
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,265
Oh, I see.

657
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:59,336
So, expert,

658
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,438
what do you think?

659
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,340
Should I get a TV in here?

660
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,175
No.

661
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,978
Jessica, I've got his drinks.

662
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:20,322
Well, gentlemen, I asked
for fun and I got it.

663
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,725
Unless you're going to give me
a pen that says Jaguar on it,

664
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:24,626
you should be reaching
for your house keys.

665
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:26,262
Good night.

666
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,939
Two more stops.
First one is the near corner of 72nd.

667
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:47,415
That went very well.

668
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:49,417
He seemed happy.

669
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:53,455
I'm sorry you
weren't feeling well.

670
00:34:53,522 --> 00:34:55,923
I'm feeling fine.

671
00:34:55,991 --> 00:34:58,125
So why do I feel like
I'm riding with a nun?

672
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,227
I didn't say anything.

673
00:35:00,295 --> 00:35:02,697
I mean, you of all people.

674
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,300
You're right.

675
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,005
- Well, have a good night.
- I already did.

676
00:35:11,073 --> 00:35:12,772
Good.

677
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,908
Boy, this is rich.

678
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:17,477
I can't believe I have to
explain I was doing my job

679
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:19,846
to a man who just pulled
his pants up on the world.

680
00:35:19,914 --> 00:35:23,449
Pete, just go home,
take a shower, and forget this.

681
00:35:23,517 --> 00:35:25,551
I suppose there are
no stern looks for Roger.

682
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:29,888
Roger is miserable.
I didn't think you were.

683
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:32,557
Have it all.

684
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:35,393
Wait till your honeymoon
is over.

685
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:37,997
Look, I'm just trying to tell
you because I am who I am

686
00:35:38,064 --> 00:35:41,133
and I've been where I've been that you
don't get another chance at what you have.

687
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,069
Brave words for a man
on his second time 'round.

688
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:46,604
Yeah, and if I had
met her first,

689
00:35:46,672 --> 00:35:48,973
I would have known
not to throw it away.

690
00:35:53,512 --> 00:35:55,579
Now I need you
to take me to Cos Cob.

691

692

Yes, come in.

697
00:36:29,535 --> 00:36:34,038
So, a little birdy told me
you've been hard at work

698
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:36,707
- writing stories.
- Oh?

699
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:38,341
Who'd have thunk
you were you by day

700
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,310
and Edgar Allan Poe by night?

701
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:43,714
It's nothing.
I only do it because my wife likes it.

702
00:36:43,782 --> 00:36:46,617
Well, my wife likes fur, but you
don't see me growing a tail.

Coming!

705
00:36:50,054 --> 00:36:52,455
You know, as an account man,
you already have a day job.

706
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:54,690
- And a night job.
- And I love it.

707
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:58,294
You knew to keep it a secret because
your attentions are divided.

708
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:03,599
I like to think we offer you
more than security here.

709
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:06,469
I understand.

710
00:37:06,537 --> 00:37:08,002
Good.

Mrs. Harris,
please excuse us.

Immediately!

725
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:12,129
Your activities last night

- have cost us this account.
- What?

Go ahead, tell him how you corrupted
my account and my friend.

Hold on.
What happened?

00:38:20,038 --> 00:38:22,072
Edwin's wife,
her life destroyed,

730
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,675
called my wife
with gory details.

731
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:26,310
Why would he say anything?

732
00:38:26,378 --> 00:38:29,445
Because he was caught with
chewing gum on his pubis.

733

( All laughing )

734

How dare you laugh at this?

735
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:39,287
What, did she just put it
there and forget about it?

736
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:44,026
- It was Edwin's idea.
- Impossible. He would never.

737
00:38:44,093 --> 00:38:46,194
He didn't ask you because
he thinks you're a homo.

738
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:50,098
I can't believe
the hours I've put into

739
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,334
helping you become
the monster you've become.

740
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:53,935
I was doing my job.

741
00:38:54,003 --> 00:38:56,271
It was my account!

742
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,540
Your account?

743
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:00,842
You have no idea
what you're doing.

744
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,977
In fact, as far as I can tell,

745
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:05,180
our need for you disappeared
the day after you fired us.

Mr. Campbell.

747

Mr. Campbell,

- No.

Or do you want me

789
00:43:20,778 --> 00:43:24,882
I just seem to find no end
to my humiliation today.

790
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:29,619
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

791
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:34,024
Everyone in this office has wanted
to do that to Pete Campbell.

792
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:42,465
Did you hear?
Lane kicked the crap out of Pete.

793
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:45,735
- I can't believe he beat me to it.
- What did Pete do?

794
00:43:45,802 --> 00:43:48,104
I don't know, but I know he
told Roger about my writing.

795
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:50,840
Why did you tell him?

796
00:43:50,908 --> 00:43:54,076
Cynthia let it slip.
Hell, she bragged about it.

797
00:43:54,143 --> 00:43:56,345
Well, you can't blame her.

798
00:43:56,412 --> 00:43:59,180
I read the one in "Galaxy"
about the girl who lays eggs.

799
00:43:59,248 --> 00:44:02,216
- Wow.
- Well, thanks.

800
00:44:02,284 --> 00:44:04,718
But Ben Hargrove is dead.

801
00:44:04,786 --> 00:44:06,854
I'm through with all
that fantasy stuff

802
00:44:06,922 --> 00:44:09,757
oh. I'm sorry.

803
00:44:09,824 --> 00:44:12,093
I'm gonna leave the
writing to the writers.

804
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:38,750
Come on.

805
00:44:53,265 --> 00:44:56,100
- Where are you headed?
- I'm meeting Megan for lunch.

806
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,941
I'm not as virtuous as you,

807
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:06,444
so you just cut me loose?

808
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:11,148
What was I supposed to do?
Step in? Punch Lane?

809
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,118
Why were we even
having a fight at work?

810
00:45:15,186 --> 00:45:17,788
This is an office.

811
00:45:17,856 --> 00:45:20,389
We're supposed to be friends.

812
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,531
I have nothing, Don.
