1
00:00:00,373 --> 00:00:02,010
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,766
We're going to take
LSD with them.

3
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,018
You don't want to see
each other any more?

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,254
You always want to push the
button on the whole thing.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,908
Grandma Pauline is still here
and I hate her.

6
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:12,150
Stay out of her way.

7
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,323
Are you leaving me?

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,182
We're leaving each other,
just like you said.

9
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:17,219
I'm not a word person
like you, people.

10
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:18,917
Your words are always
"I don't like it".

11
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,275
Don, you're gonna call back
the American Cancer Society.

12
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:23,512
What made you
suddenly write that?

13
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:25,102
It was an impulse.

14
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,819
I'll be able to drive
in a few years.

15
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,210
I can come and visit.

16

17
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:19,407
Hello.

18
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,943
Hey, it's your dad.

19
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,715
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's me.

20
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,152
Weeknight, nice.

21
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:33,020
Is Mrs. Francis
out with the mayor?

22
00:01:33,054 --> 00:01:35,289
They went to Michigan
and they took baby gene

23
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:37,057
and left me here with Bluto.

24
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:38,859
She still smell like a toilet?

25
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:40,360
Yeah.

26
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:42,596
<i>How's it going?</i>

27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,431
I'm supposed to be
studying for trig,

28
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:46,733
but, uh, I'm not in the mood.

29
00:01:46,768 --> 00:01:48,869
Oh, come on.
Her again?

30
00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:51,505
You'll see when you break up.
It hurts.

31
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:54,274
- Not for the girl.
- Shut up.

32
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:57,344
Aren't you going back to
the same camp next summer?

33
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:59,379
Did you go get
the spoonful album?

34
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:01,381
<i>Hey, bishop, who
you talking to?</i>

35
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:04,351
Your sister.
Just figuring out when we can ball.

36
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:06,452
It's on the radio all the time.

37
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:09,888
Sally, get your brother
and set the table.

38
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:11,590
Did you hear that?

39
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,059
- We're like her slaves.
- <i>Sally!</i>

40
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,595
Yeah, well, at least you don't
have to change gene's diapers.

41
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,830
No.

42
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:19,732
Fine, I'll eat by myself.

43
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:22,500
Oh! Ah!

44
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,405
- What happened?
- Oh, lord.

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,541
- What happened?
- Can you move?

46
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:31,576
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my ankle!

47
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:36,113
Okay, go get her some water.
I'm gonna call for help.

48
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,717
Bobby, go.

49
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:44,955
Why do you insist on carrying
everything yourself?

50
00:02:44,989 --> 00:02:46,890
- The doorman offered.
- Why bother him?

51
00:02:46,924 --> 00:02:49,727
- It's not that much.
- No, it is absurd.

52
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:53,196
- I see you brought work with you.
- It is my book.

53
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:55,865
I make an excuse of New York
to try and publish again.

54
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:57,266
Megan's excited about it.

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,134
My daughter pretends
to find interesting

56
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,003
what I find interesting
because she loves me.

57
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:10,412
Why are you carrying the bags?
Is Jonesy drunk again?

58
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:19,988
- So...
- Please speak English.

59
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:23,492
You like it?

60
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:26,861
I don't know.
It's exquisitely decadent.

61
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:29,296
- Well, it kind of came this way.
- No, it didn't.

62
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,964
Emile is confused.

63
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:33,768
His eyes and his politics
are having a fight.

64
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:36,036
Well, daddy, I want
you to sit down.

65
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,806
I'll fix you a drink.

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,541
I have a beautiful Dover Sole.

67
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:42,174
And I want you
to be on vacation.

68
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:44,444
<i>Formidable.</i>

69
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,317
<i>Merci.</i>

70
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:53,319
Save yourself.

71
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:55,488
Got a nice bottle
of cognac for later.

72
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:57,489
You remembered.

73
00:03:57,524 --> 00:04:00,292
I see she's convinced you
that she's particular.

74
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:03,295
I'm the proof she is not.

75
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:06,598
Hello?

76
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:08,734
Sit.
I insist.

77
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,671
Now tell me all about
your adventures today.

78
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:15,640
Hold on, sweetheart.
It's Sally.

79
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:17,409
She's okay, but you
should talk to her.

80
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:21,712
So Uncle Arnold, huh?

81
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:25,483
No one went to the funeral, but
I knew you always liked him.

82
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:28,286
Has Margaret stopped
dancing on Jane's grave?

83
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:31,989
Well, she
hardly hid her feelings.

84
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:34,191
You didn't react that way.

85
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:36,793
No, but I have to admit

86
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,330
I'm surprised that you're
in such a good mood.

87
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,531
It's unsatisfying, actually.

88
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,300
I always thought
she'd leave you.

89
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:45,235
I've been wondering lately
if she was just an excuse

90
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,070
to blow up my life.

91
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:49,472
Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

92
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,707
No.

93
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:54,577
But I did have a, um...

94
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:57,780
Well, I had
a life-altering experience.

95
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:00,450
I'll bite.

96
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:03,618
Mona, I took LSD.

97
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,553
I went on a trip.

98
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:08,923
Of course you did.

99
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:11,193
You should really try it.
You have to.

100
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,861
You'd love it, actually.

101
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,130
So what's it like?

102
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,799
Euphoria and insight

103
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,566
and-- I don't know.

104
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,202
My whole life, people
have been telling me

105
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:23,037
I don't understand
how other people think.

106
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,538
And it turns out it's true.

107
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:27,541
Maybe I should try it.

108
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:32,380
So, these...

109
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:35,081
Are four members of
the American cancer society.

110
00:05:35,116 --> 00:05:38,151
They're honoring Don for kicking lucky
strike in the balls with that letter.

111
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:40,953
Incredible.

112
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:44,590
And what am I supposed
to do with these names?

113
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,260
You remember when
we were first married

114
00:05:47,294 --> 00:05:49,195
and you used to go to luncheons

115
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:52,164
and tell me about these
powerful men that I could meet?

116
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:53,899
And you ignored me.

117
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:57,202
When I was in the deepest
part of the trip,

118
00:05:57,237 --> 00:05:59,171
the farthest away,

119
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:02,641
I was sitting in my bathtub
and I saw myself

120
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:05,577
at the 1919 World Series.
I was playing.

121
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:08,246
Aw, you finally got
to be a baseball player.

122
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,815
Yeah, but why that game?
Why that series?

123
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,717
Because that's when
it went bad.

124
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:15,619
I just realized

125
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:18,622
nothing I had was mine
because the game was thrown.

126
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:22,026
Oh, Roger, please don't feel
guilty about your advantages.

127
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,627
I, for one, am not gonna let
a bunch of dirty teenagers

128
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:26,663
in the paper disrupt
the order of things.

129
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:29,466
I'm not.
I'm trying to meet with Firestone.

130
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:32,536
It's a huge favor, I know.

131
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,472
But I lost everything
when we lost Lucky Strike.

132
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:41,444
I thought you married Jane
because I had gotten old.

133
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,782
And then I realized
it was because you had.

134
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:50,486
I haven't had
a heart attack since.

135
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,821
Well, I don't see
what the harm could be.

136
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,490
You are still
supporting all of us.

137
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:59,094
Thank you.

138
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,829
Whatever you can
find out by Friday.

139
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,533
You'd be surprised.

140
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,754
<i>- Hello?</i>
- We're in here.

141
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:37,062
Sally, Bobby, this is
Dr. and Mrs. Calvet.

142
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:38,931
- Marie.
- Emile.

143
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,500
- <i>Un plaisir.</i>
- Hello.

144
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:42,467
Hi.

145
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:44,369
Henry's mother broke her ankle.

146
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:45,937
- Oh, my goodness.
- That's terrible.

147
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:47,739
It could have been a lot worse.

148
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:49,474
Sally, you want to
tell them what happened?

149
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,076
She tripped over
one of gene's toys.

150
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:54,546
No, not that.

151
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,649
Sally called the police,
who called an ambulance.

152
00:07:57,683 --> 00:07:59,350
<i>And while they were waiting...</i>

153
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,519
Sally, go on.

154
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:05,222
I put her foot on a pillow and
put ice on it and kept her calm.

155
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:08,192
- Oh, what a big girl.
- This is wonderful.

156
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,993
Sally doesn't like fish.

157
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:12,530
Well, as a reward,
I made spaghetti.

158
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:16,799
I always made Megan spaghetti.

159
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:20,770
That was her very favorite.

160
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:24,907
So, you two

161
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:26,576
will stay in the boys' room.

162
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,944
We can't put Emile
and Marie in the bunk beds.

163
00:08:31,847 --> 00:08:34,849
I apologize,

164
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:37,252
but we had a long voyage.

165
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,787
Good night, everyone.

166
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,628
Do you give a lot of shots?

167
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:50,531
Oh, I am not a medical doctor.

168
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:52,233
I am a professor.

169
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:55,570
When you have a high
degree in any field,

170
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:58,339
they call you a doctor.
It's from the middle ages.

171
00:08:58,373 --> 00:09:01,375
That's right.

172
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,477
Let me just make sure
mom got settled in.

173
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,715
So, is Mr. Heinz
a down-to-earth,

174
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,617
kind of steel-town,
German-Polish,

175
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,385
drinks-beer-out-of-a-can
kind of guy?

176
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:50,455
No, he's boring.
He's got a daughter.

177
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,957
I think that's where he
gets all his shitty ideas.

178
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,993
Oh, who finished the shrimp?

179
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:58,062
- I asked.
- You still hungry?

180
00:09:58,096 --> 00:09:59,996
She's got to watch herself.

181
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,532
Too much Chinese and we'll
have to go up a cup size.

182
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,968
- Shut up.
- What are you talking about?

183
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:07,036
We've been working on playtex.

184
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:08,438
Peggy's got a way
with the equipment.

185
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,207
I'd love your opinion
on this, Abe.

186
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:14,344
Peggy, a traditionalist
in the bosom arena,

187
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,380
believes that we should sell
sexy bras to old ladies,

188
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:20,115
whereas I think we should sell
adult bras to young girls.

189
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,451
Abe agrees with me.
So does Don.

190
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:26,188
Well, it's not fair that just because
you're a boob-carrying consumer

191
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:28,157
that your opinion means more.

192
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:31,193
You know what? I should take off.
I've got a deadline.

193
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:33,728
And, honestly, I didn't
have enough dinner.

194
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:36,063
- I should go home.
- Oh, okay.

195
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,835
- I'll call you in the morning.
- Good night.

196
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:42,904
Mm-hmm.

197
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:49,310
He's too good-looking
for you.

198
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,918
My father won't care if he
finds out you read James Bond.

199
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,722
You know what?
This is a good book.

200
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:04,256
You should read it.

201
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:08,928
Your father said they'll sightsee
with the kids during the day

202
00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:11,897
and watch them when we go out
with Heinz tomorrow night.

203
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,099
You'll have to give
me some cash.

204
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:16,035
He won't even buy
himself a pretzel.

205
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:22,341
And they can watch them the
night of the cancer dinner.

206
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,109
That's the whole reason
they came down,

207
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:28,213
- to see you get the award.
- They came to see you.

208
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:30,849
And your father's got a
meeting with some publishers.

209
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:33,785
One publisher.
We'll call the sitter.

210
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,887
Francis the talking mule?

211
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:38,989
Don't you want them to come?

212
00:11:42,927 --> 00:11:45,529
I don't think anything's
gonna make him like me.

213
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:47,931
Because I'm his favorite.

214
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,801
Why do you think my mother
is so competitive?

215
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,268
I didn't see that.

216
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:54,371
Didn't you notice
she touched you

217
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:56,373
six times in an hour?

218
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,475
She's French.

219
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,944
No, that's not what that is.

220
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:07,549
Well...

221
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:09,852
Goodnight.

222
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:12,921
They'll be gone on Sunday.

223
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,619
Do you have a minute?

224
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,620
Lock that and get Dawn to hold
my calls so you can have five.

225
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,924
No, pervert.
This is about work.

226
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,992
I think it is, anyway.

227
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,061
I think I have an idea.

228
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:44,497
It might be really good.

229
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,733
But it might be terrible.

230
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:51,204
Well, you've established
a firm bed of insecurity.

231
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,305
Okay.

232
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,708
Last night when I was
feeding the kids spaghetti,

233
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,344
I realized that my mother
had made it for me

234
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,812
and that her mother
had made it for her.

235
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:04,783
And I got this picture
in my head of her becoming me

236
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,753
<i>like with one of those</i>
<i>movie dissolves.</i>

237
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,688
And then this morning
in the shower,

238
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,857
I realized you could
take it all the way back

239
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,293
to cavemen and then
do the middle ages,

240
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,262
the renaissance,
all the way up to now

241
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,098
and then the future,
like a colony

242
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,369
on the moon and you see
earth out the window.

243
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,503
That's very good.

244
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:28,605
But we don't sell spaghetti.

245
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,975
No, Heinz baked beans.

246
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:33,710
Oh.

247
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,313
It solves a lot
of problems, doesn't it?

248
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:41,617
My God.

249
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:43,185
Get over here.

250
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:46,188
No, I don't want
to change the subject.

251
00:13:46,222 --> 00:13:49,325
I'm not changing the subject.

252
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:52,595
What are we showing tomorrow?

253
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:54,229
Human cannonball.

254
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:56,299
I mean, it's funny
and I loved it,

255
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,732
but...

256
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:01,969
Dawn, get Stan and Ginsberg
in here right away.

257
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:05,006
Oh, they're gonna hate me.
Tell them it was your idea.

258
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,509
You don't really want me
to do that, do you?

259
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:08,976
No.

260
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:12,146
"Kids want beans
and they have forever."

261
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:14,915
Oh, I had something like,

262
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:18,485
"Heinz beans,
some things never change."

263
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,154
Jesus, I think that's better.

264
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:26,627
- You rang?
- I'm gonna need both of you on Surrette.

265
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:28,762
We're changing Heinz.

266
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,898
<i>Mr. Drexler for you.</i>

267
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,569
Thank you, Patricia.

268
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:39,739
- Hello?
- How's Minetta tavern sound for dinner?

269
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:41,774
It's Thursday.
Not good.

270
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:44,610
- You're gonna eat anyway.
- Well, come by.

271
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:48,179
I'm not coming by. I can't talk to
you there and I don't want to wait.

272
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,717
Oh, okay.

273
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:54,085
I could meet you early
if I come back.

274
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,587
6:00?

275
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:57,789
7:00.
I'll see you there.

276
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:00,692
She couldn't have been
struck by lightning a week ago?

277
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:03,026
You think that's her idea?

278
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,764
What happened?

279
00:15:06,798 --> 00:15:08,932
Boss's wife had an idea.

280
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:12,236
- Is it any good?
- It's better than what we had.

281
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,072
Good for her.

282
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,308
<i>Come in.</i>

283
00:15:21,178 --> 00:15:23,346
I'm supposed to be in the
final mix for Vicks tonight

284
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,383
and I need to switch it.
It's very important.

285
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,185
Who scheduled it.

286
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,521
I have something else to do.

287
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,656
Well, that almost never
happens, so don't feel bad.

288
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:36,926
It doesn't, does it?

289
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:39,929
Can I have a cigarette?

290
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:41,964
<i>Joan?</i>

291
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:47,270
Do you want to close the door?

292
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:58,713
I thought everything
was going great, but...

293
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,551
Now I have this terrible
feeling about Abe.

294
00:16:05,454 --> 00:16:06,987
I think he's gonna end it.

295
00:16:07,022 --> 00:16:08,522
Why?

296
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,557
He wants to have dinner

297
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:12,526
and he knows
weeknights are hard.

298
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,827
And we just saw
each other last night.

299
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:17,230
And he wouldn't
take no for an answer.

300
00:16:22,236 --> 00:16:25,104
Well, it's been my experience

301
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,007
that when a man insists on a meal,
he has something important to say.

302
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:32,744
It's usually a proposal.

303
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:35,981
Really?

304
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,584
Well, that's you.

305
00:16:39,618 --> 00:16:41,954
Men don't take
the time to end things.

306
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:43,822
They ignore you

307
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:46,857
until you insist on
a declaration of hate.

308
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:48,960
Someone dumped you?

309
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:51,095
Peggy, I'm just like
everybody else.

310
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:55,132
If he's going to end it,
which I doubt,

311
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,134
you'll know what to do.

312
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:00,371
If he's going to propose, you'd
better have your answer prepared,

313
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:02,638
especially if it's no.

314
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,576
Gosh.

315
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:14,017
I should go home
and change, shouldn't I?

316
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:16,252
Or better yet,

317
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,953
go shopping.

318
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:29,498
So the mom's wearing
the glass space helmet

319
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:31,633
and the kid took his off
and put it on the table?

320
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,534
That way, the kid
can eat the beans.

321
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:35,203
And I thought you
could do the whole thing

322
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,571
with the same actors
playing mother and child.

323
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:39,840
<i>Mr. Sterling's here to see you.</i>

324
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:46,514
Oh, you two
are actually working.

325
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:48,616
Go break it into frames
and have Stan draw it up.

326
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,123
I've been working
this morning, too.

327
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,291
You mean you finished yours,
you're moving onto mine?

328
00:17:58,326 --> 00:18:01,128
No, I've been in
the war room, Don,

329
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:03,630
preparing for the American
Cancer dinner.

330
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:07,033
Caroline went to the library and
got me pictures of these guys.

331
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,735
I'm $50 away
from a seating chart.

332
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,137
Look, I don't take
this honor lightly.

333
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:12,638
Good.
Say something like that.

334
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:15,341
Titans of industry
are giving you an award.

335
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,010
We are being lowered in a
bucket into a gold mine.

336
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:20,646
I'm gonna bring my pick and
crack something off the wall.

337
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,914
I don't think it's
that kind of atmosphere.

338
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:25,716
You actually saying that
with a straight face?

339
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:27,785
You forget why
you wrote that letter?

340
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:29,620
Are you forgetting you said
it would kill our business?

341
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:30,955
So you think cigarettes are bad

342
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,157
and so are the people
who sell them?

343
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,791
It's what they think.

344
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:36,294
Mary Lasker and the rest of
them know it as the truth.

345
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:37,894
It doesn't matter
why I wrote it.

346
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:39,463
You're right.

347
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,565
Who knows why people
in history did good things?

348
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:44,601
For all we know, Jesus was trying to
get the loaves and fishes account.

349
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:48,238
I'll do what I can, but I'm
not gonna go overboard.

350
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:49,940
My in-laws don't think
I'm Jesus.

351
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:51,408
They'll be clapping
and cheering.

352
00:18:51,443 --> 00:18:52,576
They don't know
you're a hypocrite.

353
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,377
Megan's father is a communist.

354
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,745
- What?
- He's a socialist

355
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,781
or a maoist or some ideology

356
00:19:01,385 --> 00:19:04,087
plus, you know, I'm
sleeping with his daughter.

357
00:19:04,121 --> 00:19:05,521
So he'll see you shaking hands.

358
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,056
You know,
it's very interesting,

359
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,291
but a lot of times you think
people are looking at you,

360
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,659
but they're not.
Their mind's elsewhere.

361
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:14,762
Lots of people that haven't taken LSD.
Already know that, Roger.

362
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:16,431
You're gonna be like
an Italian bride--

363
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,167
People lining up
to give you envelopes.

364
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,788
- You look good.
- Thank you.

365
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:49,236
The steak is supposed
to be good here.

366
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,637
The menu's huge.

367
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:55,075
The service is incredible, but I told
them to leave us alone a second.

368
00:19:56,244 --> 00:19:58,143
Can I get a drink?

369
00:19:58,178 --> 00:19:59,979
Yeah, sure.

370
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:01,646
I guess I can get
somebody's attention.

371
00:20:03,483 --> 00:20:05,217
No.

372
00:20:05,252 --> 00:20:06,785
Forget it.

373
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,823
What do you want to say?

374
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,525
Okay.

375
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,229
I've been thinking about this.

376
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:21,465
We're at a place where
we love being together.

377
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,935
It always seems to be
some kind of pain in the ass

378
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,970
to be in the same place
when the lights go out.

379
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,540
Oh, my God.

380
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:31,909
Yeah, well,

381
00:20:31,943 --> 00:20:35,512
I think we should
move in together.

382
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,983
I mean, how would
we ever do that?

383
00:20:40,018 --> 00:20:41,618
Well, however you want.

384
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:43,954
I mean, I think your place
would be better.

385
00:20:46,423 --> 00:20:47,890
It's because that's how I feel.

386
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,525
I just like the idea
of the two of us

387
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,894
waking up in the same
place every day.

388
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:53,930
The two of us writing
together in the same room,

389
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:56,498
looking at each other
every once in a while.

390
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:58,434
Grocery shopping.

391
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:03,405
Look,

392
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:05,240
I know it's a big decision.

393
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:08,476
So you don't have to say
yes or no right now.

394
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:13,348
Maybe we should order.

395
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:19,987
Oh, excuse me.

396
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:23,690
Yes.

397
00:21:27,262 --> 00:21:29,763
You've made me so happy.

398
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:32,199
Me, too.

399
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:37,303
You still want to eat?

400
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:40,006
I do.

401
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:46,479
Actually, my father is on the board
of the American cancer society.

402
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,881
Although he said the voting
was unanimous for Don.

403
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:50,582
Well, that is quite an honor.

404
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:53,085
And as much as we
appreciate the invitation,

405
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,652
we're heading back
to Pittsburgh

406
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:56,855
the minute I leave
your office smiling.

407
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:58,823
You're really gonna rush off?

408
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:01,158
I think Ken got you tickets to the new
Edward Albee play.

409
00:22:01,193 --> 00:22:04,228
- Oh, we saw it on Tuesday.
- You did?

410
00:22:06,264 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah, we came in
a couple days early.

411
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:12,203
Alice loves the city.
Did I not mention that?

412
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:14,671
No reason to, I guess.

413
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,206
Raymond, would you
order me a sanka?

414
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,741
I'm gonna freshen up.

415
00:22:19,143 --> 00:22:21,244
And some dessert.

416
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:22,913
Come on, why not?

417
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:26,249
You know, I've always
wanted to eat here.

418
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:28,451
I thought it was just
for time life employees.

419
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,027
You know, I really enjoy
spending time with you.

420
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:40,730
I feel the same way, Alice.

421
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:44,534
I'm only saying this because Raymond's
putting on such a good show.

422
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:46,501
He didn't want to go to dinner.

423
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:48,670
He just wanted to
do it in your office.

424
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:50,972
He's a good man, I swear.

425
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:52,908
Of course he is.

426
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:54,943
I was really prepared
to not like you,

427
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:57,145
but you're so good
for that man.

428
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,381
- And you're so lively.
- Thank you, Alice.

429
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,483
I'm just saying I hope we
can continue to be friends.

430
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,324
No, see, the truth in packaging
bill they wanted to pass

431
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,361
would hit everybody hard,
but now there's no teeth.

432
00:23:14,395 --> 00:23:16,329
So nothing should change.

433
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,801
We're getting fired.

434
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:30,543
Sorry, but we ended up getting more
dessert than we bargained for.

435
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,378
Who's up for a nightcap?

436
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,012
That's okay.
I think we're gonna turn in.

437
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:36,582
Do me the favor, Raymond.

438
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:38,416
You don't know this,
but you've rescued me

439
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,351
from a house full
of in-laws and children.

440
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,588
Can we get a bottle of
sauternes and six glasses?

441
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:46,491
I don't know. We have the early
meeting tomorrow and the flight back.

442
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,360
You know, Don jokes about
having a house full of people,

443
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,730
but he loves it.
Don?

444
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,367
Don, tell him about last night.

445
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,076
Oh, well,

446
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,344
we had three generations
under one roof--

447
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:10,647
Megan, her mother
and my 12-year-old Sally.

448
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:13,349
Sally won't eat anything,
as you might imagine.

449
00:24:13,383 --> 00:24:16,152
Except beans, of course.

450
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,553
It's true.

451
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:19,188
They do like them.

452
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:20,824
Never had any worries
about that.

453
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:23,726
You should have seen it--
Megan bringing the pot in,

454
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,861
spooning them out on the plate,
her mother was smiling.

455
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:27,930
- What a darling scene.
- Actually, I didn't know

456
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:30,866
if I had done something wrong
because Don was staring at us.

457
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,369
But apparently
I'd given him this idea.

458
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:36,538
She did.

459
00:24:36,572 --> 00:24:39,440
Don, you sure you want
to talk about this now?

460
00:24:39,474 --> 00:24:41,075
Let him talk.

461
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:45,246
Obviously there's more to it,
but I think it would be

462
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,915
a series of one-shot
little movies.

463
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:51,052
One mother starting
in the prehistoric caves

464
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:54,087
serving beans to a shaggy
little boy by the fire.

465
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:56,356
Then a Greek woman

466
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,192
in a toga with
a little shepherd boy.

467
00:24:59,226 --> 00:25:01,461
Then Marie Antoinette
to a little prince.

468
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:03,462
Mary Jane to a pioneer boy.

469
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:06,499
All the way through
the gay '90s to today

470
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:08,902
in a kitchen like yours.

471
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:11,336
Would it all be the same
mother and child?

472
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,675
We hadn't thought of that,
but that might work.

473
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:18,210
Tell him the rest of it.

474
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:20,913
Well, it goes past
present day to the future

475
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:24,016
to a little lunar kitchen with
the earth off in the window.

476
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:27,552
You know, futuristic
clothing, interesting bowls.

477
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:30,288
The kid has just taken off
his space helmet

478
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,256
as he takes a warm bite.

479
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:34,225
Oh, that's clever.

480
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:35,660
That was Megan's idea.

481
00:25:35,695 --> 00:25:37,595
When Don told me, I thought,

482
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:39,564
we're all so busy
and we rush around

483
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:41,666
and it will probably
always be like that.

484
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,735
But a mother and child

485
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:47,871
and dinner--
That'll never change.

486
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:51,575
"Heinz beans,

487
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:53,844
some things never change."

488
00:25:53,878 --> 00:25:56,013
- Can I get some more coffee?
- Shh!

489
00:25:58,381 --> 00:26:00,516
I don't know what to say.

490
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,454
Let me think about it.
See the pictures.

491
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:07,356
Raymond, really?
It's beautiful.

492
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,826
And it's exactly--

493
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,228
I don't know.
Can I get the cream, please?

494
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:18,066
Well, we were dancing around
a few other things, too.

495
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:20,869
No, we weren't.
This is what you're gonna see tomorrow.

496
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:22,871
It's a once-in-a-lifetime idea.

497
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:25,573
Raymond, you could save yourself
a trip to the office tomorrow

498
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:28,610
or we can get in the
elevator, go down 11 floors

499
00:26:28,644 --> 00:26:30,778
and show you
the work right now.

500
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:35,282
It's the future.

501
00:26:35,316 --> 00:26:37,684
That's all I ever wanted.

502
00:26:39,221 --> 00:26:42,223
Should we change that
sauternes to champagne?

503
00:26:44,025 --> 00:26:46,359
Sure, why the hell not?

504
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:56,870
72nd and Park.

505
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:05,244
Do you know you're good
at all of it?

506
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:07,345
You had the idea

507
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,016
feeding me the pitch, knowing to
pull the trigger at that moment.

508
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,852
I was just gonna scream
in his stupid face.

509
00:27:13,887 --> 00:27:15,954
I'm glad you didn't.

510
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:18,156
I love the way you sold that.

511
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,158
Oh, my God.

512
00:27:21,426 --> 00:27:23,261
I want you.

513
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,364
But we have to go
back to the house

514
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:30,034
with the kids and your parents.

515
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:34,437
We can go back to the office.

516
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:37,340
Change of plans.
Back to time life, please.

517
00:27:58,028 --> 00:28:00,395
There's champagne
in the conference room.

518
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,532
Don and Megan sold Heinz
last night over dinner.

519
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:08,236
But, by looking
at your fingers,

520
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,371
maybe you're not
in the mood to celebrate.

521
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:12,841
No, of course.

522
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:17,011
It was better than that.

523
00:28:17,046 --> 00:28:18,847
Really?

524
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:21,049
We're moving in together.

525
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,083
He asked me.

526
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:25,219
Shacking up?

527
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:26,887
My goodness.

528
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:29,122
I know, but--

529
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:30,657
No, Peggy.

530
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:34,027
Good for you.

531
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:36,163
Really?

532
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:38,564
You're not just saying that?

533
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:42,301
No.
I don't know.

534
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:45,905
Sounds like he wants to be
with you no matter what.

535
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,609
I thought you were going
to be disappointed for me.

536
00:28:50,643 --> 00:28:52,644
I think it's very romantic.

537
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,946
It is, isn't it?

538
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:59,684
We don't need a piece of paper.

539
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:02,220
I mean, not that marriage
is wrong or anything.

540
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,422
Greg has a piece of paper
with the US Army

541
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:07,225
that's more important
than the one he has with me.

542
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,094
Oh, I'm sorry.

543
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:12,496
It is what it is.

544
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,798
I think you're brave.

545
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:18,302
I think it's
a beautiful statement.

546
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:20,737
Congratulations.

547
00:29:26,043 --> 00:29:29,478
So Megan comes out and does a double
secret reverse to Don that it's over.

548
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:32,115
Then they just passed it back and
forth like a couple of pros.

549
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:35,018
- You weren't even there.
- Way to go.

550
00:29:35,052 --> 00:29:36,786
You should be shaking her hand.

551
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,056
- It's just beginner's luck.
- Oh.

552
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,026
- I'm gonna go tell Peggy.
- Tell everybody.

553
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,061
<i>You want the
pleasure of telling Lane?</i>

554
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:47,529
<i>No, you earned it.</i>

555
00:29:47,563 --> 00:29:49,864
Besides, we're still
at least 15 grand

556
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:51,766
out of pocket on the account.

557
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:59,640
Megan!
Congratulations.

558
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:01,409
- Oh, you heard.
- Yeah.

559
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:03,411
Joan told me Harry said
you signed Heinz.

560
00:30:04,913 --> 00:30:06,347
I don't want to take
all the credit.

561
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:09,050
Why aren't you
jumping up and down?

562
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:11,018
I don't know what the Canadian
equivalent of baseball is,

563
00:30:11,053 --> 00:30:12,619
but this is a home run.

564
00:30:12,654 --> 00:30:15,755
- We have baseball.
- Well, this is a home run.

565
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:18,624
I know what you did
and it is a big deal.

566
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,561
And when it happened to me, they
acted like it happens all the time.

567
00:30:21,595 --> 00:30:24,397
It doesn't.

568
00:30:24,432 --> 00:30:26,366
I tried to crack that nut.

569
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,935
I mean, if anything,
I should be jealous.

570
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,537
But I look at you
and I feel like,

571
00:30:32,572 --> 00:30:34,373
I don't know,

572
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:36,675
I'm getting to experience
my first time again.

573
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,379
It's a good day for me.

574
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:44,883
This is as good
as this job gets.

575
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,685
Savor it.

576
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:51,222
You're right.

577
00:30:51,256 --> 00:30:53,024
I will.

578
00:31:01,282 --> 00:31:04,684
Good morning, Emile.
Where is everyone?

579
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:07,186
The girls went out
and Bobby is helping me

580
00:31:07,221 --> 00:31:09,188
fill my fountain pen.

581
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:14,193
Thanks, Emile.

582
00:31:14,228 --> 00:31:16,663
Hello.

583
00:31:16,697 --> 00:31:19,165
<i>Bonjour.</i>

584
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:20,465
Uh-oh.

585
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,867
It's not as bad as you think,

586
00:31:21,902 --> 00:31:23,602
but it's pretty bad.

587
00:31:23,637 --> 00:31:26,005
- Sally.
- Go ahead.

588
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:29,041
Papa, can I come with you to see
you get your award tonight?

589
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:30,809
Papa?

590
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:33,712
I don't know.

591
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:36,414
I got a dress.
Please?

592
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,316
Every daughter should get
to see her father as a success.

593
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,997
It's fine.

594
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:55,532
Sweetheart, of course
you can go.

595
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:58,569
Thank you, daddy.
Can I show you my dress?

596
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:04,875
Bobby, put that away.
You two watch TV or something.

597
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:12,481
What was that about?

598
00:32:16,553 --> 00:32:18,588
My father went to his
publisher this morning

599
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:21,057
and was back within the hour.

600
00:32:21,091 --> 00:32:23,692
And then he got on
the phone with claudette,

601
00:32:23,726 --> 00:32:25,794
his latest grad student.

602
00:32:25,828 --> 00:32:29,464
My mother walked in.
He was crying, apparently.

603
00:32:29,498 --> 00:32:32,567
Well, he's got a lot
wrapped up in that book.

604
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:35,003
He should be crying
to my mother, Don.

605
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:38,974
Oh, right.

606
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:43,276
What about tonight?

607
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:45,813
They do this all the time.

608
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:48,148
They'll recover.
They always do.

609
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:58,257
Hurry, it's really hot.

610
00:33:05,032 --> 00:33:06,766
Wait.

611
00:33:18,077 --> 00:33:20,179
Hi, ma.
Come in.

612
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:22,114
Hello, peaches.

613
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:23,949
Abraham.

614
00:33:23,983 --> 00:33:25,917
Hello, Katherine.

615
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:28,586
Oh, you brought dessert.

616
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:30,421
Just leave it in the box.
I'll take it out.

617
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:32,089
It's very delicate.

618
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:35,160
You want some sherry?

619
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:36,827
Sure.

620
00:33:39,632 --> 00:33:41,266
Smells good in here.

621
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,501
Peggy made a ham.
It's my favorite.

622
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:45,169
Really?

623
00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:54,378
- Are you babysitting?
- No.

624
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,947
- Hello.
- Hello.

625
00:33:57,982 --> 00:34:02,618
Roger Sterling, this is Dr.
Emile and Marie Calvet.

626
00:34:02,653 --> 00:34:04,654
You ladies look ravishing.

627
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:06,755
- Thank you.
<i>- Can I get you a drink?</i>

628
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,757
Uh, no.
I mean, yes.

629
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:10,959
But does anyone know
how to tie this thing?

630
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:13,162
- Here.
- I'm stag tonight

631
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:15,164
and my doorman
wears a clip-on.

632
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:18,567
I am surprised.

633
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:22,136
You seem like you were
born in a bow tie.

634
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:24,138
I didn't tie that one either.

635
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:28,776
<i>Good evening, everyone.</i>

636
00:34:28,811 --> 00:34:30,445
My God.

637
00:34:35,183 --> 00:34:37,084
Sally, you look so beautiful.

638
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:40,787
You're beautiful, sweetheart.

639
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:43,023
<i>Don, there is
nothing you can do.</i>

640
00:34:43,057 --> 00:34:45,192
No matter what, one day
your little girl

641
00:34:45,227 --> 00:34:47,494
will spread her legs
and fly away.

642
00:34:49,263 --> 00:34:51,797
- What? It's true.
- Wings, daddy.

643
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,068
Take off the makeup
and the boots.

644
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:58,204
What? No.

645
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,673
Or you can stay home.

646
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,543
Fine.

647
00:35:14,186 --> 00:35:16,121
This is the ballroom?

648
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,156
There's no staircase.

649
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,824
But here's a handsome prince.

650
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:23,394
Nah.

651
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:25,563
Hello, all.
Don't you look lovely?

652
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:28,031
I hope you don't mind if I steal
your father for a moment.

653
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:29,967
I'd love for you
to meet Ed Baxter.

654
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,002
- Ken's father-in-law.
- No, of course.

655
00:35:32,036 --> 00:35:34,472
Megan, could you join us?

656
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:36,473
I got 'em.

657
00:35:39,477 --> 00:35:41,811
Ed, Don Draper, his wife Megan.

658
00:35:41,845 --> 00:35:45,014
Pleased to meet you.
Both of you.

659
00:35:45,048 --> 00:35:46,783
I guess I should
thank you for this.

660
00:35:46,817 --> 00:35:50,420
No, don't thank me.
I had to recuse myself.

661
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:52,788
But you write
some stirring copy.

662
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:56,325
Actually, Megan's a hell
of a copywriter as well.

663
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:58,894
Well, I should lie,
but Cynthia told me

664
00:35:58,928 --> 00:36:00,862
all about your dinner.

665
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:04,232
- She's a natural.
- Thank you.

666
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,072
- Who's he?
- His name is Ed. He's at dow corning.

667
00:36:12,107 --> 00:36:15,610
They make beautiful dishes,
glassware, napalm.

668
00:36:15,644 --> 00:36:17,712
- Peter Campbell.
- Emile.

669
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:19,480
And his wife's name is Lillian.

670
00:36:19,515 --> 00:36:21,949
- Don't forget that.
- I won't.

671
00:36:21,983 --> 00:36:25,852
And those two over there, the
balding guy with Margaret Dumont,

672
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:28,388
he's at GM.
Where's your purse?

673
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:31,891
You're gonna be my date.

674
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,160
Every business card
I bring back,

675
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:36,863
you're gonna put it in your purse
and say "go get 'em, tiger."

676
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:41,600
- So I manage those accounts.
- I don't understand.

677
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:44,770
What do you do every day?

678
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:46,772
Well, what do you do?

679
00:36:46,807 --> 00:36:49,408
You're a scholar
and an intellectual, right?

680
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:51,144
Yes.

681
00:36:51,178 --> 00:36:53,880
Actually, from what I hear,
you're a bit of a trailblazer.

682
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:57,415
I don't know if that's true.

683
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,385
I bet the world would be better off if
they knew about the work you're doing.

684
00:37:01,988 --> 00:37:04,022
You are very kind.

685
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:07,292
That, Emile,

686
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:09,728
is what I do every day.

687
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:13,197
Ah.

688
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,399
Shit.
I've got to beat the entree.

689
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,202
Cover me.

690
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:21,739
Your dad is very resourceful.

691
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,431
Please.
I got this.

692
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:51,069
I'm sorry, honey.
I wasn't gonna leave before dessert,

693
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,971
but this is taking a little
longer than I thought.

694
00:37:58,177 --> 00:37:59,977
Well...

695
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:06,083
We have something
we want to tell you.

696
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,985
Really?

697
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,356
Abe and I are very
serious about each other

698
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:15,225
and we've decided we're
going to live together.

699
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,427
What?

700
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,096
Listen. I know
you may not approve,

701
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,667
but it's important to me
that you understand

702
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:26,136
what we're doing.

703
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,672
I will take
very good care of her.

704
00:38:31,608 --> 00:38:34,076
You know what?

705
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,711
I'm gonna go.

706
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:37,913
What?

707
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:39,982
I'm gonna go.

708
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:42,117
I need my cake.

709
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:43,486
Why?

710
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,454
Because I'm not
giving you a cake

711
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,955
to celebrate youse
living in sin.

712
00:38:49,425 --> 00:38:51,125
Would you rather
I not tell you?

713
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,728
Yeah. You want to
stick it in my face?

714
00:38:53,762 --> 00:38:56,931
Just lie. You think you're the
first ones ever to do this?

715
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:02,836
- Ma.
- What do you want from me?

716
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,373
I'm gonna get you a cab.

717
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:10,611
I invited you here as an adult

718
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:13,747
because I didn't want to lie
and I want you in my life.

719
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:16,617
Well, if you're an adult,
why do you care what I think?

720
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:18,984
I thought you'd be relieved
I wasn't marrying the Jew.

721
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:21,654
It has nothing to do with that!

722
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:23,556
It's my fault.

723
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:26,326
Because once your father died, there
was no one to set you straight.

724
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,160
I know what I'm doing.

725
00:39:28,195 --> 00:39:30,263
And I think daddy would
want me to be happy.

726
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:33,799
No. He'd be mad at you
the same way I am

727
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:36,368
because you are selling
yourself short.

728
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:40,139
This boy, he will
use you for practice

729
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:43,109
until he decides to get
married and have a family.

730
00:39:43,143 --> 00:39:45,711
And he will, believe me.

731
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:49,414
You want me to be alone?

732
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,854
You know what
your aunt used to say?

733
00:39:59,058 --> 00:40:01,793
You're lonely, get a cat.

734
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:04,763
They live 13 years,

735
00:40:04,797 --> 00:40:07,765
then you get another one and
another one after that.

736
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:09,833
Then you're done.

737
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,103
Thank you for dinner.

738
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,345
<i>All of us here appreciate
your years of service.</i>

739
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,547
Ooh, baked Alaska.
It's flaming, but they probably don't want

740
00:40:24,582 --> 00:40:26,949
- to wreck the speeches.
- You're wrecking the speeches.

741
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:30,387
You're a mean drunk. You know that?

742
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:33,990
<i>From the Sterling Cooper Draper
Pryce advertising firm...</i>

743
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:36,192
- Oh, your daddy's next.
- <i>Mr. Donald Draper.</i>

744
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,029
Thank you.

745
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,168
Shouldn't I be at his side?

746
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:48,003
Go get 'em, tiger.

747
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:01,148
Can I see it?

748
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,325
Do you want it?

749
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:13,660
No, you should keep it because
it makes you really happy.

750
00:41:16,497 --> 00:41:18,465
You know what makes me happy?

751
00:41:18,499 --> 00:41:20,434
A beautiful young lady
who will someday

752
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,536
be wearing makeup,
but not today.

753
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,476
I got you a shirley temple.

754
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,678
It's time to start
tapering off.

755
00:41:32,713 --> 00:41:34,847
And, Don, I promised Frank
from Ford over there

756
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:36,615
you'd come and say hi.

757
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,169
I'd buy you a drink, but I
think they're still free.

758
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:02,172
I have been watching
you all night.

759
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:07,778
You're so full of life
and ambition.

760
00:42:07,812 --> 00:42:09,346
Well, I've gotten
a lot of rejection,

761
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:11,047
so who knows what I'm full of?

762
00:42:11,082 --> 00:42:14,351
When I was younger,

763
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:17,720
it was my spirit
to try everything,

764
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:19,722
get a taste,
know what was what,

765
00:42:19,757 --> 00:42:22,625
and never be sorry
for making the mistakes.

766
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:24,960
And then one day,

767
00:42:24,995 --> 00:42:27,697
I made too many mistakes.

768
00:42:27,731 --> 00:42:29,732
Where was I that day?

769
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:32,967
Inside you is a little boy.

770
00:42:33,002 --> 00:42:35,036
Well, Marie, I woke up one day

771
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:39,441
and I realized at what point
should you ever stop trying?

772
00:42:41,377 --> 00:42:44,345
I agree.

773
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,581
We should have
everything we want.

774
00:42:50,286 --> 00:42:53,021
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Can you watch the award?

775
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,688
I got it.

776
00:43:03,198 --> 00:43:05,832
Daddy, I'm glad you came.

777
00:43:05,866 --> 00:43:08,201
Then why do you look so sad?

778
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:11,405
I'm not.
I'm just tired.

779
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:13,840
It's been a busy week.

780
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:16,843
Yes, you have
a big beans success.

781
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:20,112
Don't make fun, papa.
I know you don't approve.

782
00:43:21,114 --> 00:43:23,349
Is this your passion?

783
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:29,221
Because you have changed.

784
00:43:29,256 --> 00:43:31,190
I always thought
you were very single-minded

785
00:43:31,224 --> 00:43:34,193
about your dreams and that that
would help you through life.

786
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:37,295
But now I see that you
skipped the struggle

787
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,597
and went right to the end.

788
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:42,533
It's not the end.
It's the beginning.

789
00:43:42,568 --> 00:43:46,137
This apartment, this wealth
that someone handed to you,

790
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:48,539
this was what Karl Marx
was talking about.

791
00:43:48,574 --> 00:43:51,076
And it's not because
someone else deserves it,

792
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,078
it's because it is
bad for your soul.

793
00:43:54,112 --> 00:43:55,980
Don't beat me
with your politics

794
00:43:56,014 --> 00:43:58,314
because you hate
that I love Don.

795
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:01,351
No, I hate that you gave up.

796
00:44:02,953 --> 00:44:04,653
Don't let your love
for this man

797
00:44:04,688 --> 00:44:06,789
stop you from doing
what you wanted to do.

798
00:44:42,024 --> 00:44:44,691
- Excuse me.
<i>- I've been telling Ken</i>

799
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:47,027
you should get out of
your business altogether.

800
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:48,895
Why is that?

801
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:55,801
I'd introduce you to him,

802
00:44:55,836 --> 00:44:57,870
but I don't want you
to waste your time.

803
00:44:57,905 --> 00:44:59,839
He's on the board.

804
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:02,141
- He obviously likes my work.
- He loves your work.

805
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:04,544
They all do.

806
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:06,646
But they don't like you.

807
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,114
- What?
- This crowd,

808
00:45:09,149 --> 00:45:11,684
they'll bury
your desk in awards,

809
00:45:11,718 --> 00:45:14,186
but they'll never
work with you,

810
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,355
not after that letter.

811
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,156
I mean, how could
they trust you

812
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,824
after the way you bit the hand?

813
00:45:23,663 --> 00:45:26,631
Oh, sorry about that.

814
00:45:26,666 --> 00:45:28,533
You want another?

815
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,871
Yeah, sure.

816
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:35,405
Two.

817
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:06,069
- Excuse me, miss. Are you
finished with that? - Yes.

818
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:17,679
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Did I wake you?

819
00:46:17,714 --> 00:46:19,215
<i>Yeah, but it's okay.</i>

820
00:46:19,249 --> 00:46:21,383
I get a lot of attention
every time you call.

821
00:46:21,418 --> 00:46:23,718
People think
you're my girlfriend.

822
00:46:23,752 --> 00:46:25,920
I'm not.

823
00:46:25,954 --> 00:46:27,855
Why are you whispering?

824
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:30,258
I'm in Manhattan at my dad's.

825
00:46:30,292 --> 00:46:32,327
Bluto broke her foot.

826
00:46:32,361 --> 00:46:34,429
Spectacular.

827
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:36,498
Yeah.

828
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:39,199
How's the city?

829
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:41,835
Dirty.

830
00:46:44,224 --> 00:46:50,348
