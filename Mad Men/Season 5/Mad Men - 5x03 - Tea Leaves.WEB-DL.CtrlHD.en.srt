00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,681
Betty, are you ready?

3
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:47,683
( Straining )

4
00:00:47,684 --> 00:00:49,151
It's stuck.

5
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,686
( Inhales ) What about now?

6
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:54,490
Henry:
<i>Betty!</i>

7
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:56,225
I'll get it.
Just go.

8
00:00:57,827 --> 00:01:00,095
Betty.
The car is here!

9
00:01:05,534 --> 00:01:07,601
What's going on?
We've got to go.

10
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:10,538
Darling, I just don't think
I can go tonight.

11
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,673
What's the matter?

12
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:16,677
It's... a woman's thing.

13
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:19,446
Is there any way
you could play with pain?

14
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:20,747
It's the junior league
of New York.

15
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,448
I don't want to
do it without you.

16
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,951
Your mother will be there.
It'll be very endearing.

17
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,093
Forgive me on the way?

18
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,334
( Sighs )

19
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:46,905
( Speaking French )

20
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,810
Thank you.

21
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:55,279
( Speaking French )

22
00:01:57,382 --> 00:01:59,183
Say <i>"au revoir."</i>

23
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:05,289
Bon jour, Marie.

24
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,491
Marie, I can't understand you.

25
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,960
- <i>Moustiques?</i>
<i>- Mosquitoes.</i>

26
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:13,063
Okay, mama.
( Speaks French )

27
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:18,666
We can't let Heinz
beat us there.

28
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,502
He has a name, you know.

29
00:02:20,503 --> 00:02:22,170
And do you know what that is?

30
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:23,505
Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,807
He's the only man I want
to please more than you.

32
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:27,408
And your father.

33
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:29,276
I'm the baby.
They miss me.

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,216
So, Megan, you're French.
I suppose I should ask you what looks good.

35
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:37,017
I'm Canadian.

36
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:39,320
Although for all
we know, they are, too.

37
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:41,188
You know, back in Pittsburgh,

38
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:43,889
everybody's pretty much
who you expect them to be.

39
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,358
Or you know them forever.

40
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:47,560
Raymond and I
met in high school.

41
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:51,131
Well, then we've been
married longer than you.

42
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:54,234
- I told you he was smooth.
- How did you two meet?

43
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,770
- Well...
- At work.

44
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:01,473
Don was divorced.

45
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:04,677
Well, that's none
of my business.

46
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,618
You have a teenage
daughter, Emily.

47
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:12,053
- How's her summer?
- It's tough.

48
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:14,088
She's around the house
all the time.

49
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:16,790
Too old for camp,
too young for a job.

50
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,627
- I say let her enjoy it.
- I agree.

51
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,531
You don't sound so happy
about it when I get home.

52
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:24,767
Well, the music is so loud.

53
00:03:24,768 --> 00:03:27,903
Do you know
the Rolling Stones, Don?

54
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:30,906
- Sure.
- The Stones.

55
00:03:30,907 --> 00:03:33,074
She can't get enough of them.

56
00:03:33,075 --> 00:03:36,477
The other night, she's playing this
song "Time, Time Is On Your Side."

57
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:39,380
- "Time Is On My Side."
- Yes, it is, dear.

58
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:42,016
Well, it's catchy.
And I was thinking,

59
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:44,285
what if they were
to sing, you know,

60
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:48,155
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz
is on my side"?

61
00:03:48,156 --> 00:03:50,623
Or something like that.
I don't know.

62
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:52,358
( Laughs )

63
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,527
They're gonna be in New York.

64
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,663
Emily almost jumped in our bags with
us when she heard we were coming.

65
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,734
Maybe you could, you know,

66
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:02,437
get them to record
it while they're here.

67
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,138
Well, that's not exactly
the way it works,

68
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,673
but we can certainly
approach them.

69
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:09,409
This is boring.
Am I right, Megan?

70
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:14,914
- Yes?
- ( Laughing )

71
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:19,786
Clara, where is Roger?

72
00:04:19,787 --> 00:04:21,286
<i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>

73
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:22,755
Caroline says the meeting
<i>is in his office.</i>

74
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:24,490
( Sighs )

75
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:29,862
You wanted to see me?

76
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:30,996
I was waiting in my office
to give you some good news.

77
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:33,131
Drinking good news?

78
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:35,568
Mohawk called.

79
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,736
You're welcome.

80
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:40,405
They haven't informed
their agency,

81
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,273
but I'm told it's
a matter of hours.

82
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:44,242
Welcome back, suckers.

83
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,277
I think you should
handle the account.

84
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:49,848
- So, they asked for me?
- They enjoy your company.

85
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:51,549
And since you were here
when they were here,

86
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,632
they think you know
their business.

87
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,586
I know Hank from the war.
He likes vodka.

88
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,922
Jack likes Jack.
Anything else?

89
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,858
So you're aware they've taken
on $54 million in debt

90
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:04,396
to replace their planes?
And there's a mechanic strike looming.

91
00:05:04,397 --> 00:05:07,065
- Although they'll likely be spared.
- So far, so good.

92
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,466
Don and I have been
trying to explain to Lane

93
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:12,349
this is a daily business and we'll
need a dedicated copywriter.

94
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:15,371
I don't understand why Miss
Olson can't handle it.

95
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:17,541
Because these guys are gonna
ask her to make drinks.

96
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,709
We're still paying Don,
aren't we?

97
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,412
Don's not going to rewrite local
fare ads three times a week.

98
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:24,280
That's all it is?

99
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:28,283
Just get a guy with basic retail
experience and run with it.

100
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:30,452
Congratulations!

101
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:33,622
Lane, smile.
We've got an airline.

102
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,127
Morning.
I'm here to see Don.

103
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:41,663
Yes, just a minute.
Mr. Draper.

104
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:43,230
Mr. Crane to see you.

105
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:45,266
<i>Just a minute, Dawn.</i>

106
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:46,868
Is Don in a meeting?

107
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:48,736
He's with Mrs. Draper.

108
00:05:48,737 --> 00:05:50,538
Thank you, Dawn.

109
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:52,173
You're welcome.

110
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:56,243
It's so confusing.

111
00:05:56,244 --> 00:05:57,644
People keep saying that.

112
00:05:57,645 --> 00:05:59,779
But we haven't had
any problems.

113
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,448
You haven't.
But out in the office,

114
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:04,050
it's really hard
to tell who's who.

115
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:10,957
- Hello, Harry.
- Good morning.

116
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:17,028
Backstage Forest Hills tennis
stadium Saturday night,

117
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:19,398
put your hands together
for the Rolling Stones.

118
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,200
And how would you
gauge their interest?

119
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:24,002
The manager sounded greedy.
I thought we'd take one car.

120
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:26,271
- I'll drive.
- It starts at 8:00.

121
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:28,740
But apparently they're always late.
I thought we could grab a bite.

122
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:31,643
There's a dynamite Italian restaurant
with a first-rate veal parm.

123
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:34,145
- Nope.
- Good.

124
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:37,515
Then I will be ready
at 7:30 having eaten.

125
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:39,751
Have Dawn pencil it in.

126
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:47,124
( TV playing )

127
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:52,195
<i>( Knocking )</i>

128
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,610
- Hello, Pauline.
- Hello, dear.

129
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:11,479
I just wanted to see
how you were feeling.

130
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:15,083
Aren't you sweet to come
all the way over here

131
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:17,218
when a phone call
would've sufficed?

132
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,920
Are the children home?

133
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,255
They're at day camp.
You know that.

134
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:24,759
Betty, you were sorely
missed last night.

135
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,029
Well, that's good
to hear, I guess.

136
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,198
You've missed a bunch
of these, Betty.

137
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,367
Pauline...

138
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,202
And I'm sure he never shows it,

139
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:39,405
but it upsets Henry
when you're not there.

140
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:41,407
I want him to be happy.

141
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:43,909
And you being with him
is part of that.

142
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,579
I wasn't feeling well.

143
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,249
Honey, I know how it happens.

144
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,619
You get comfortable
and you give up a little bit.

145
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,889
And then it just
gets out of control.

146
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,326
There are things
you can do about this.

147
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:04,296
There are pills you can take.

148
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,631
Why haven't you taken them?

149
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,434
Believe me, I would if I could.

150
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:12,703
I have a heart condition.

151
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:15,005
And honestly, at my age,

152
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:18,075
I don't have to
please men anymore.

153
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:24,247
But you...

154
00:08:24,248 --> 00:08:25,715
Don't you want to get back

155
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:29,651
into that incredible
closet of yours again?

156
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:32,254
( Sighs )

157
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:36,926
It'll be easy for you.

158
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,795
You're just one of those girls.

159
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,403
- Thank you, Dawn.
- ( Laughs )

160
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:52,472
- What's so funny?
- She was the most qualified.

161
00:08:53,808 --> 00:08:55,175
We've got great news,

162
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:57,410
but assume this is for
your ample ears only.

163
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,312
Is it about Heinz
and the Rolling Stones?

164
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:01,181
- What?
- No.

165
00:09:01,182 --> 00:09:03,150
Harry's such a liar.

166
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,918
Baked beans
and the Rolling Stones.

167
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,886
A client's idea
if I ever heard one.

168
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:08,788
Mohawk airlines is returning.

169
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,957
That's great.
That's a big fish.

170
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,992
It's a minnow,
but it's our minnow.

171
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,728
Well, I obviously
have experience.

172
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:18,530
- I mean, at a low level, but I saw how it worked.
- Your plate is full.

173
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:22,715
And, frankly, Mohawk is going to
insist on a regular copywriter.

174
00:09:22,835 --> 00:09:25,770
- Someone with a penis.
- I'll work on that.

175
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:28,072
Call in books.
You're the search committee.

176
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:29,807
- Okay, when?
- Immediately.

177
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,441
Now, this is gonna
be my account.

178
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:33,944
So I don't want just some
hack with retail experience.

179
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:36,747
He should be brilliant
and have awards.

180
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:39,583
I want you to bring me
a good-looking version of Don.

181
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:41,584
Oh, that'll be easy.

182
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,024
- Mrs. Francis.
- Hello.

183
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:49,893
So nice of you
to see me so quickly.

184
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:51,627
Well, slow day.

185
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:53,663
What seems to be the problem?

186
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:56,431
Well, it's just that
I've been wondering--

187
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:00,635
I've put on a few pounds

188
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:03,939
and I haven't had much luck
reducing on my own for some reason.

189
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,542
Well, with middle-aged women, it gets easier
to put it on and harder to take it off.

190
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,115
Well, a friend told me
it'd be easier

191
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,517
if you gave me diet pills.

192
00:10:17,886 --> 00:10:20,654
Just to give me
a little jump-start.

193
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:23,024
Is your friend a doctor?

194
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:24,792
No.

195
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,295
Well, I'm not going to
give you a prescription

196
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:29,996
without giving you an exam.

197
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,466
For diet pills?

198
00:10:33,802 --> 00:10:35,569
If you think it's necessary.

199
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,405
Mrs. Francis, when a housewife
has a rapid weight gain,

200
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:41,074
the cause is usually
psychological--

201
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:44,645
Unhappiness, anxiety,
boredom--

202
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:47,314
Things that cause us
to lose our self-control.

203
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:50,718
But first, we have to rule out

204
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:53,587
diabetes, hyperthyroidism.

205
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:56,122
Well, I don't need
to take the pills forever.

206
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,526
I don't like that.

207
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,527
- What?
- Shh.

208
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,197
Could you swallow?

209
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:14,073
Henry!

210
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,709
Henry!

211
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,679
<i>Henry!</i>

212
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,849
- <i>( Intercom buzzes )</i>
<i>- Mrs. Francis is on line one.</i>

213
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,290
- Betts, you there?
- Don.

214
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,625
- I don't know what to do.
- About what?

215
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,027
I went to the doctor this morning
and he found this thing.

216
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,231
It's a--
a node or a nodule

217
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,855
or something
and it's on my thyroid.

218
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:47,438
They don't know what it is,
but it's a lump, Don.

219
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:49,774
And he's sending me to the city
to some specialist for tests.

220
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,942
Okay, okay, calm down.

221
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:54,211
I can't, Don.
I can't.

222
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,213
Betts, what exactly did he say?

223
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,416
Well, nothing.
You know how they are.

224
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:05,122
Do you want me
to take the kids?

225
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:07,723
( Sighs ) The kids.

226
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:11,093
Oh, the kids.
Oh, God.

227
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,863
Birdy.

228
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:19,135
Say what you always say.

229
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:24,005
Everything's gonna be okay.

230
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:25,506
Okay.

231
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:27,608
Bye-bye.

232
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:37,652
( Sighs )

233
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,254
( Sighs )

234
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:43,023
If I see one more Volkswagen ad
with something else in it...

235
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,660
You can do an ad
on anything you want.

236
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:49,729
Don't pick toilet paper,
shit bird.

237
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,424
Too fat.
Too thin.

238
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:57,793
Shelly Parker-- Might be
a woman, God forbid.

239
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:01,095
( Chuckles )

240
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:04,766
"Judge not,
lest ye be judged."

241
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,868
Irony.
That's promising.

242
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:17,110
Have I lost my sense
of smell or is this good?

243
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:23,317
( Chuckles ) That's bitchin'.

244
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:25,986
What's this guy's name?

245
00:13:25,987 --> 00:13:28,588
Michael Ginsberg.

246
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:31,257
Nice knowing you, Mike.

247
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:33,460
What are you doing?
That's the best one I've seen.

248
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:35,850
This is why girls
don't play sports.

249
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:38,220
You've been working on
Heinz for four months.

250
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:40,555
Somebody else is gonna carry
the ball across the goal line?

251
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:42,391
Bringing him in for Mohawk.

252
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:44,825
I hope you like him.
He's gonna be your boss someday.

253
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:48,143
I like working with talented people.
It inspires me.

254
00:13:48,351 --> 00:13:51,888
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about another writer.

255
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:53,823
Are you suddenly not
competitive?

256
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:57,293
The chick who races
people to the toilet?

257
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,128
I'm going to bring him in.

258
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,797
Stick to mediocre.
You'll sleep better.

259
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:08,804
( Sighs )

260
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:18,178
- <i>( Knocks )</i>
<i>- Henry: Can I come in?</i>

261
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:20,147
Of course.

262
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:23,751
I just got off
the phone with Jim.

263
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:26,020
He said tomorrow at 11:00.

264
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:27,989
Tomorrow?

265
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,891
My boss made a call.

266
00:14:30,892 --> 00:14:32,726
You told Mayor Lindsay?

267
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:35,261
He's got bigger secrets
than this, Betty.

268
00:14:37,197 --> 00:14:38,698
I don't know if tomorrow--

269
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,001
You want to wait on this?

270
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,019
Well, if it is something--

271
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,887
If, if, if.

272
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,190
Betty, let's not play
that game, okay?

273
00:14:49,826 --> 00:14:51,593
Come to bed.

274
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:53,495
You want some Brandy?

275
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:00,870
I see you all the time.
You're beautiful.

276
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:03,005
You're sweet.

277
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,250
I'm gonna have a Brandy.

278
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,656
Betty.

279
00:15:22,657 --> 00:15:25,559
Betty Draper.
I almost didn't recognize you.

280
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,528
Joyce. Hello.
How are you?

281
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,998
Not good.
I'm here.

282
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:35,302
Mrs. Francis,
the doctor's waiting.

283
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:36,803
It's Francis now.

284
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:39,405
My husband's name
is Henry, too, actually.

285
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,739
Look, you know what?

286
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,575
I'm gonna be in
radiology forever.

287
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:44,743
Mrs. Darling, they're
waiting for you, too.

288
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,145
Why are you here?

289
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,315
You want to get
some lunch after?

290
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,417
Oh, I don't know.
My husband's picking me up.

291
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,419
You think you don't want to
have lunch, but you do.

292
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,589
Okay.

293
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,490
Okay, okay.
I'm going.

294
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:09,210
Hello.
I'm Peggy Olson.

295
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:12,147
Michael Ginsberg.
Lead the way.

296
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:13,916
No, we're meeting here.

297
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:17,252
So what's he like?

298
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:19,321
Is he like a firm
handshake kind of guy?

299
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:21,089
- Excuse me?
- Don.

300
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,223
I want to make a good impression.
You could help me out.

301
00:16:23,224 --> 00:16:25,726
No, I'm interviewing you.
I'm a copywriter.

302
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:27,662
Have a seat.

303
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,366
So is Don stopping by?

304
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,569
Nope, it's just me.

305
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,337
Can you hire me?

306
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:38,939
Well, no,
but I'm the first round.

307
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,508
Wouldn't you want to talk to
the person who could hire you?

308
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:43,775
I spent three weeks dancing

309
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:46,178
at that crappy New York
satellite of Leo Burnett.

310
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:50,015
Never met him at all.
Turns out Leo's not a real person.

311
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:52,784
- Yes, he is.
- Is Don a real person?

312
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:55,053
'Cause I'd really like
to meet him.

313
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:57,621
I'm the person you need
to impress right now.

314
00:16:57,622 --> 00:17:00,992
You looked at my book.
What more can I say?

315
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:05,330
Okay.

316
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:08,967
- I liked your work.
- And I like your work.

317
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,668
You thought I was a secretary.
Do you have a current resume?

318
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:22,778
- Allen Ginsberg?
- He's the most famous Ginsberg there is.

319
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,713
I figured we got
to be related somehow.

320
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:28,182
( Chuckles )
And what's he gonna say?

321
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:31,219
Okay, well, it was
nice meeting you.

322
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,088
Oh, nuts.

323
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:34,822
Listen, my stuff is good.

324
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:37,125
You can see advertising
ain't my day job.

325
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:40,462
Look, you're a fair woman.

326
00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:43,864
I insulted you because
I'm honest.

327
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:46,533
And I apologized
because I'm brave.

328
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:49,169
I didn't pick this profession.
It picked me.

329
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,937
I didn't have
any control over it.

330
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:54,308
Turns out, it's the only
thing I can do.

331
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,076
Your work's
very impressive, but...

332
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:57,577
Here's some other
advantages--

333
00:17:57,578 --> 00:18:00,013
I have no hobbies,
no interests, no friends.

334
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:02,281
I'm one of those people who
talks back to the radio.

335
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,451
No girlfriend, no family.
I will live here.

336
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,720
Then you're like everyone else.

337
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:10,689
I've never been accused of
that, but I really am trying.

338
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,928
I don't know.

339
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,964
You can't act
like this with Don.

340
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,999
Like what?

341
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,005
- We'll call you.
- Okay.

342
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,845
You know, your book
really does have a voice.

343
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,847
That's what they said
about "Mein Kampf."

344
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:38,716
"The kid really has
a voice."

345
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,490
You're sure you're
okay just with tea?

346
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:50,126
- Yes.
- Everything tastes like sawdust to me.

347
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:52,762
Everything still tastes
good to me.

348
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:55,531
Turns out I have the only
kind that makes you fatter.

349
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,767
Look, I'm sure you're fine.

350
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,970
When do you find out
the results?

351
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,939
I don't remember.

352
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,875
It wasn't until the third
visit that I knew.

353
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:09,411
Because Hank was waiting there.

354
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,480
Have you told your children?

355
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:14,816
They know I'm going
to the doctor a lot.

356
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:16,251
And they know I'm sick,

357
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:19,621
but I've always been
in a bad mood, so...

358
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:21,622
( Laughs ) I joke with Hank.

359
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:23,924
He should just tell them
I got hit by a car.

360
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:27,161
It'd be easier to deal
with than saying good-bye.

361
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:29,997
Ugh, the scene.

362
00:19:29,998 --> 00:19:32,233
( Sighs )

363
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:34,835
I'm leaving behind such a mess.

364
00:19:34,836 --> 00:19:37,737
You're not going anywhere.

365
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,839
He's my second husband.

366
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,142
His mother's domineering.

367
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:46,645
And Don's girlfriend--

368
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:49,648
Well, they're married.

369
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:51,884
She's 20 years old.

370
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:54,753
They'll never hear
a nice word about me again.

371
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,425
I'm sorry,
but I have to ask you.

372
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:07,799
What is it like?

373
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:14,868
Well,

374
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:19,476
it's like you're
way out in the ocean

375
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:21,911
alone and you're paddling,

376
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:24,347
and you see people
on the shore,

377
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,948
but they're getting
farther and farther away.

378
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:30,018
And you struggle
because it's natural.

379
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,889
Then your mind wanders
back to everything normal.

380
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,288
What am I gonna fix for dinner?

381
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:38,323
Did I lock the back door?

382
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:42,826
And then you just get so tired,

383
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,795
you just give in

384
00:20:44,796 --> 00:20:47,431
and hope you go straight down.

385
00:20:50,135 --> 00:20:53,504
That's horrible.

386
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:55,873
No one's ever asked.

387
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:00,310
Hello, ladies.
I am Cecilia,

388
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:02,312
and I have the gift of sight.

389
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:04,080
Could I offer you a reading?

390
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:06,849
( Laughs ) You're gonna
predict our future?

391
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,852
- Go ahead.
- Really?

392
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,055
It's always good.

393
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,186
- Oh, my.
- What?

394
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,869
You're a great soul.

395
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,038
You mean so much
to the people around you.

396
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:32,808
You're a rock.

397
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:36,578
Oh, I'm sorry.

398
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,446
We're done.
Thank you.

399
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,687
You need some more tea.

400
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:48,055
( Exhales )

401
00:21:53,194 --> 00:21:55,295
( Groans )

402
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:58,532
- Are you okay?
- I had drinks with Mohawk.

403
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:01,935
I sat down with two of them and I
swear by the end there were three.

404
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:03,903
Did you hire him?

405
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:06,305
No, he was crazy.
I'm calling in more books.

406
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:08,341
Define crazy for a copywriter.

407
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:11,276
Sleeps all day,
disrespectful of authority,

408
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:13,412
drunk half the time.
Did he smell like pee?

409
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:16,015
- Who smells like pee?
- Writers. Just hire him.

410
00:22:16,016 --> 00:22:18,350
I can't. Don will hate him.
He's certifiable.

411
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:20,117
I order you to bring him in.

412
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:22,921
You have to.
I already told Mohawk.

413
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:24,756
Why would you do that?

414
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:27,458
I wanted to smooth the ground
about working with a Jew.

415
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,861
Turns out, everybody's
got one now.

416
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:32,964
Tell you the truth, it makes
the agency more modern.

417
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:35,632
Between that and "it's always darkest
before the dawn" over there.

418
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:38,101
At least this one
we're hiring on purpose.

419
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:40,503
I can find another Jew if
that's what you care about.

420
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:42,673
Look, I know
what you're afraid of.

421
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,708
Sweetheart, no one's
gonna replace you.

422
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:47,778
Oh, I'm not threatened by his talent.
He's not that good.

423
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,613
I just think Don will hate
him and then he'll hate me.

424
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:54,283
Oh. I'll be there.
I'll handle Don.

425
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:59,921
( Radio and TV playing )

426
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,129
- How can you hear anything?
- I'm following your advice.

427
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,231
I'm being bathed
in commercials.

428
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:13,401
My God, you're so square,
you've got corners.

429
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:15,736
I have to make sure
I look like the man.

430
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,876
If Betty calls
or, you know, the kids,

431
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:23,844
tell them I'll call
them in the morning.

432
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:25,712
What did she want anyway?

433
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:27,647
Who knows?

434
00:23:27,648 --> 00:23:29,749
Well, have fun.

435
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,651
I don't mean that.

436
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,226
This is backstage.
That's the real backstage.

437
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:49,134
Nice to see yo.

438
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:51,737
- We're here to see the Rolling Stones.
- They're not here.

439
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:54,658
Well, actually, we're here to
see their manager, Allen Klein.

440
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,775
- He's not here, either.
- I'm Harry Crane.

441
00:23:56,776 --> 00:23:59,177
- I'm on the list.
- There's no list.

442
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:01,346
Will you let us know
when they get here?

443
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:03,348
Sir, I promise you'll know.

444
00:24:06,151 --> 00:24:08,486
I should have talked him out
of this at the dinner table.

445
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:09,620
Well, we either wait
for them to show up

446
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:13,223
or wait for them
to come out of there.

447
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:17,594
Hey, mister, tell your friend I'll
trade him a joint for a cigarette.

448
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:19,129
You can have one for free.

449
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,466
No, I just wanted to make
sure you guys weren't cops.

450
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:25,002
Can you light this for me?

451
00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:26,303
There's a cop right over there.

452
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:27,871
He's cool.

453
00:24:32,575 --> 00:24:34,643
- What are you doing?
- They're cool.

454
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:36,545
They don't look cool.

455
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,387
- What are you two doing here?
- We're here on business.

456
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:48,289
- What kind of business.
- Advertising.

457
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,291
Like "Bewitched"?

458
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:55,406
You're Durwood
and he's Mr. Kravitz.

459
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,722
Are you sure you want to?

460
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,725
It's been too long.

461
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,662
I thought that's what
you wanted.

462
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:43,306
You know who has
the best stuff?

463
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,942
- Charlton Heston.
- Who's that?

464
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:49,746
We went to his house,
he came out naked.

465
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,614
He's a very
good-looking man.

466
00:25:51,615 --> 00:25:54,417
I guess if I looked like that,
I would be naked a lot, too.

467
00:25:54,918 --> 00:25:57,752
In fairness, I don't think
he knew we were there.

468
00:25:57,753 --> 00:25:59,454
It was kind of
an impromptu meeting.

469
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:02,724
We wanted him to be
the voice of Vaporub.

470
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:05,294
Right?
Wouldn't that be perfect?

471
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:07,796
She just said she doesn't
know who he is.

472
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,264
Come on, they're letting us in.
I told them how important you are.

473
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:12,033
- Thank you.
- No, just Harold.

474
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:14,179
- Who'd you tell 'em I was?
- Just go!

475
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:18,005
Hey, he's getting
me in, not you.

476
00:26:18,006 --> 00:26:19,907
I'll send for you.

477
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:26,146
She knows what she's doing.

478
00:26:26,147 --> 00:26:29,916
You really think you're gonna get
the Rolling Stones to do a TV ad?

479
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:32,118
They did one
for cereal in England.

480
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,753
It must have been
a long time ago.

481
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:35,822
It was three years ago.

482
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:38,491
When you were probably,
what, 11?

483
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:50,536
You see someone
do that in a movie?

484
00:26:50,537 --> 00:26:53,553
You need to relax.

485
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,493
So what do you like so much
about the Rolling Stones?

486
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:03,130
Why don't you get me
backstage and you'll see.

487
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:10,737
What do you feel
when you hear them?

488
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:13,739
Brian Jones.

489
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,641
He's a troubadour.

490
00:27:18,312 --> 00:27:20,646
So you feel romantic.

491
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:23,282
God, you're like
a psychiatrist.

492
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:25,951
What do you know
about psychiatrists?

493
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,174
Do you have a business card

494
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:36,443
or something I could
try on the doorman?

495
00:27:58,132 --> 00:27:59,565
I'll make breakfast.

496
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:03,535
If, if, if.

497
00:28:09,676 --> 00:28:12,044
You know what?
I am hungry.

498
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,052
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

499
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,453
So what do you think?
They gonna show?

500
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:43,888
Stop looking at your watch.

501
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,157
They're gonna come
when they come.

502
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,625
They're gonna come
right down that hallway

503
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,261
and I'm gonna jump on
Brian like Jack Ruby.

504
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:53,246
And what do you
expect to happen?

505
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:55,481
I'll get into
that dressing room

506
00:28:55,482 --> 00:28:59,318
and I'm gonna stare at him
while he tunes his guitar.

507
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,687
He'll see me from across
the room.

508
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:04,990
I'm lady Jane.
He'll know that.

509
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:06,959
Then what are you gonna do?

510
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,161
Me I don't know.
Whatever he wants.

511
00:29:10,678 --> 00:29:13,380
And what do you think he wants?

512
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:14,915
None of you want any of us

513
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:17,251
to have a good time
just 'cause you never did.

514
00:29:17,252 --> 00:29:21,221
No, we're worried about you.

515
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:23,590
<i>( Helicopter whirring )</i>

516
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:25,892
Got it!
I got it!

517
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:28,027
They want to do it.
I have never seen people more excited.

518
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:30,496
- Wait, you met them?
- Man: <i>They're here. They're here.</i>

519
00:29:30,497 --> 00:29:32,498
Woman:
<i>The Stones are here!</i>

520
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:35,434
( Screaming )

521
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:46,411
Who were you talking to?

522
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:48,713
They even sounded just like
them when they were singing.

523
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,231
They played for me.

524
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:55,469
I'm sorry I failed, Don.

525
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,804
We can try again tomorrow.
Asbury Park?

526
00:29:57,805 --> 00:30:00,140
Forget it.
Manager looked right through us.

527
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:03,944
You want the last one?

528
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:06,179
There were 20.

529
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,948
I thought you were getting
it for your family.

530
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:10,217
You know what?
Let them get their own.

531
00:30:10,734 --> 00:30:13,335
You bring home a bag
of food and they go at it,

532
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:16,337
and there's nothing
left for you. Eat first.

533
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:18,005
That's my recommendation
to people who say

534
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:21,909
they're getting married
and having kids-- Eat first.

535
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,380
- Sure you don't want it?
- Harry, you have to go.

536
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:28,282
Just let me sit here
for a second.

537
00:30:30,184 --> 00:30:32,218
I have to get home.

538
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,157
Those girls, Don.

539
00:30:38,158 --> 00:30:40,527
Those young girls.

540
00:30:40,528 --> 00:30:42,562
They are so much fun.

541
00:30:42,563 --> 00:30:45,698
Everybody's having fun.
They're all on drugs.

542
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:48,000
You're on drugs.

543
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:50,455
You signed the trade winds.
Who the hell are they?

544
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:53,773
Just go inside.

545
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:56,942
What are we gonna tell Raymond?

546
00:30:56,943 --> 00:30:59,478
That the Rolling Stones
aren't good for Heinz.

547
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,913
Yeah.

548
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:03,347
His daughter just probably
wanted to meet them.

549
00:31:03,348 --> 00:31:05,817
I don't think they're good
for her, either.

550
00:31:05,818 --> 00:31:07,886
( Sighs )

551
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:11,209
I'm gonna leave the bag.

552
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,944
Jennifer has me on a diet.

553
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:17,988
- We should do this again.
- Bye, Harry.

554
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:23,186
<i>( Starts engine )</i>

555
00:31:31,834 --> 00:31:34,135
I waited as long as I could,
but we've got to go.

556
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:39,240
( Groans )

557
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,042
Really?

558
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:42,944
Drink too much with the Stones?

559
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:46,079
No, we didn't get to meet them.

560
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:49,022
Well, you'll have plenty
of time to tell me.

561
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:50,991
It takes forever
to get to Fire Island.

562
00:31:53,093 --> 00:31:54,861
Did Betty call?

563
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:57,898
No.
Let's go.

564
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,966
Megan.

565
00:32:01,835 --> 00:32:03,468
What?

566
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:11,410
I have to tell you something.

567
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:12,912
What happened?

568
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:15,080
It's Betty.

569
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:18,716
She might be sick.
Really sick.

570
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:20,885
What?

571
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:23,320
They found a tumor.

572
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:25,489
That's terrible.

573
00:32:27,092 --> 00:32:29,827
Why didn't you tell me?

574
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:32,229
I didn't know how you'd react.

575
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,765
What, did you think
I'd be happy?

576
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:37,434
I don't know what I thought.
I just knew she wouldn't want you to know.

577
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:40,777
Well, it affects me.

578
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:43,847
There's a possibility
that it's nothing.

579
00:32:43,848 --> 00:32:46,950
And if it's something,
we'll deal with it.

580
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:48,418
You know I love Sally.

581
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,319
No, no, no. I don't want
to have that conversation.

582
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:53,989
Great.
Then let's go.

583
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,791
Your trunk's on the dresser.

584
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,893
No.

585
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:02,097
I just can't.

586
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:05,667
Megan, you are 26 years old.

587
00:33:05,668 --> 00:33:08,136
So I don't understand death?

588
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:12,247
I understand you went to
that concert last night,

589
00:33:12,248 --> 00:33:15,650
but now it's suddenly too overwhelming
when we're supposed to go see my friends.

590
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:25,292
Come on.

591
00:33:25,293 --> 00:33:27,161
There's nothing you can do.

592
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:31,799
It's okay.

593
00:33:38,606 --> 00:33:41,775
( Children giggling )

594
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:11,836
This is very provocative.

595
00:34:11,837 --> 00:34:14,572
Oh, that one.
I was at the movies.

596
00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:18,716
Well, not the movies.
I was in Times Square at a peep show.

597
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:21,353
- Shouldn't we wait for Roger?
- For what?

598
00:34:21,354 --> 00:34:23,755
He doesn't even come to the
meetings that are important.

599
00:34:23,756 --> 00:34:26,491
- Go on.
- There's a resume in there.

600
00:34:27,926 --> 00:34:29,860
Okay.

601
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:35,632
So you were at Needham
for a long time

602
00:34:35,633 --> 00:34:37,467
and a lot of other places
for a short time.

603
00:34:37,468 --> 00:34:39,904
I checked his references thoroughly
or I wouldn't have brought him in.

604
00:34:39,905 --> 00:34:41,705
Would you let him talk?

605
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:43,739
Ahem.

606
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,210
I'm opinionated, but I
know if you were my boss,

607
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:50,079
I would have no problem
saying, "Okay, Don."

608
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,148
Unless you want me
to call you "Mr. Draper."

609
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:54,650
I worked for someone like that.

610
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:56,119
Kirk Whitby?

611
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,254
I'm not gonna say.

612
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:00,688
You wouldn't want me running all
over town telling your secrets.

613
00:35:01,263 --> 00:35:03,665
Well, I wouldn't want you
grumbling behind my back, either.

614
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,834
You're right.
I shouldn't have said that.

615
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,970
I just wanted
to make you smile.

616
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:12,173
I'll be honest.

617
00:35:12,174 --> 00:35:14,275
I've admired you
since the letter.

618
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:16,777
I thought it was the funniest
thing I ever read.

619
00:35:16,778 --> 00:35:18,913
<i>And the fact that I can</i>
<i>say the letter</i>

620
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:21,115
and everyone knows
what I'm talking about.

621
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:24,619
I just want to be
a part of this place.

622
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,954
I think it's on the way up.

623
00:35:26,955 --> 00:35:28,656
Between you and Margaret...

624
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:30,892
She's very interesting.

625
00:35:30,893 --> 00:35:33,092
And I think I made
it clear, so are you.

626
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:40,667
Pleasure to meet you, Michael.

627
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:53,879
Good work.

628
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,748
Thanks.

629
00:35:55,749 --> 00:35:58,483
Promise me you didn't just
hire the handsomest one.

630
00:35:58,484 --> 00:36:00,085
Anything else?

631
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:02,120
Get him set up and let
him haggle with Lane.

632
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:12,837
Roger, I see you've met
Mr. Ginsberg.

633
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,307
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream of
throwing something through this window.

634
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,477
- How'd it go?
- Good.

635
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,746
See?
I'm proud of you.

636
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,714
Mr. Ginsberg,
follow me.

637
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,088
Ahem, I'm sorry.

638
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,691
My stomach grumbles sometimes and
it can sound like the F word.

639
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,992
You know, I thought you were crazy when
I met you, and you have confirmed it

640
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:39,028
by not acting the way
that you acted with me.

641
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:40,896
You told me
not to act that way.

642
00:36:40,897 --> 00:36:43,633
And the fact that you can
control it really scares me.

643
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:47,736
So I'm not getting the job?

644
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:49,938
No, you start tomorrow.

646
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:56,844
I would like to pick you up and
spin you around right now,

647
00:36:56,845 --> 00:36:59,047
but I don't want people to think
that's how I got the job.

648
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:00,882
I'm glad you're excited.

649
00:37:01,457 --> 00:37:05,193
Come on, be proud of me.
I need it.

650
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:08,163
Nobody in the world cares
I got the job but you.

651
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:10,330
Then I'm happy.

652
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:12,066

Well, tell Jim His Honor's
not going to Michigan.

660
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,790
Because Romey's a clown

and I don't want him
standing next to him.

Can we talk later?

Thank you for getting
back to me so quickly.

You're okay, you know.

I feel like I just
got off a boat from China.

Hey, everything's okay.

Betty, come on.
You're exhausted.

That's what it is, isn't it?

I don't know
how many ways to tell you,

Oh, my God, this is what it could be.
But it's not gonna be.

Okay.

I'd like to say that
I've gathered you all here

so you may remember how small
this agency once was.

Now, now.
I'm just pleased

00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:19,572
that after a long effort
I was able to sign them.

703

Little prick dangled it in
front of me and took it away.

It was disrespectful.

You know, I used to
love that kid.

719

I would hold his hand and
help him up on the swing set.

720
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:21,269

I'm tired of trying to prove I
still have any value around here.

You want me to make a call?
