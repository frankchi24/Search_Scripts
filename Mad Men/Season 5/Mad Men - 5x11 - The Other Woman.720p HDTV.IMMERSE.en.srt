00:00:00,427 --> 00:00:02,241
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:05,321
I get everything right and
I'm still getting it from you!

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,437
We were in the running,
I mean, actually this time...

4
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:10,218
for Jaguar.

5
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:13,748
Since I was a little girl it's
all I've ever dreamed about.

6
00:00:13,894 --> 00:00:15,870
I don't wanna keep
you from your dream.

7
00:00:16,012 --> 00:00:18,288
I have a spectacular
new site in the city.

8
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:20,179
Aren't you worried
you're going to get caught?

9
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:21,736
I've got an apartment.

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,150
When we land Jaguar the world
will know we've arrived.

13

Jaguar, the mistress who'll
do things your wife won't.

14
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:17,999
What did I say before?

15
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:19,734
The client doesn't want
to hear the word mistress.

16
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,637
Salesmen can use it,
but the campaign can't.

17
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:25,775
Jaguar, you'll love it
when you're in it.

18
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:28,511
Are we just spitting up
lines now?

19
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:32,587
You know what?
Let's take a break.

20
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,954
Where are you going?

21
00:01:37,988 --> 00:01:40,924
What was unclear about the fact that
he's taking a break and we're not?

22
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,768
I need you to sign off
on Secor laxative.

23
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:55,405
I told you you were in charge of all
ongoing business till Jaguar's done.

24
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,574
- Just handle it.
- Done.

25
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:00,478
- How's the prospect doing?
- Is it lunchtime?

26
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:02,013
Jesus, is it?

27
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:04,815
Mr. Sterling bought
lobster from The Palm.

28
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:06,750
Doesn't that sound good?

29
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:10,588
( Men cheering )

30
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:15,192
( Laughing )

31
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:19,431
So I don't know what the
Jaguar executives will say.

32
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:22,234
But I got dealerships
in Montclair,

33
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:25,270
Englewood, Morristown,
Paramus and Rutherford.

34
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:27,039
And I carry three other
foreign cars.

35
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:30,343
So, frankly, creative has
to be pretty spectacular,

36
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:32,912
or Jaguar is just another
word on the sign.

37
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:35,448
Well, then we have
nothing to worry about.

38
00:02:35,482 --> 00:02:37,783
The dealership on the ground
floor of the corporate offices

39
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:41,421
on Madison has done very well just
having that XK-E in the entrance.

40
00:02:41,455 --> 00:02:43,156
You have to be excited
about this car.

41
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,125
Oh, it's a red-hot number.
I'm excited about that.

42
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,328
But I'm a hard man to please.

43
00:02:48,363 --> 00:02:51,365
I always feel like someone
should go the extra mile.

44
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,933
We're open to anything
your heart desires.

45
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:57,137
Well, the other day

46
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,373
when we were all touring
your offices,

47
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,975
our guide was
a dynamite redhead.

48
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,379
- Joan Harris.
- Built like a B-52.

49
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:07,348
Yeah, we know who
you're talking about.

50
00:03:07,383 --> 00:03:10,184
Well, I sure would like the opportunity
to get to know her better.

51
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:12,819
Well, a lot of guys would.
But, you know, she's--

52
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:14,488
She's a very interesting girl.

53
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:17,225
She's one of these free spirits?

54
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:19,294
You know, open to ideas?

55
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:22,997
So you like redheads?
I think I know some.

56
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:25,200
I like that redhead.

57
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:28,069
And I think she and I
would both

58
00:03:28,104 --> 00:03:31,005
welcome the opportunity
to spend a night together.

59
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,977
Well, you could ask her out.
It wouldn't be a conflict.

60
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:37,679
No, I'm kind of shy.

61
00:03:39,516 --> 00:03:41,216
All I'm saying is, if it happens,
it would make me happy.

62
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,320
If it doesn't, well, no
guarantees in life, right?

63
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:49,425
Get another round.
I'll get it.

64
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,393
Absolutely not.

65
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:53,896
Was that what I think it was?

66
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,432
Yes, it was.

67
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:57,733
Why didn't you just let me
tell him she was married?

68
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:01,370
Because so is he.
And he already knows that.

69
00:04:01,404 --> 00:04:04,207
Well, we wanted to be
in the car business.

70
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:12,716
- You waited up.
- No.

71
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,917
I mean, yes.

72
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:18,121
I'm going in to read tomorrow
for a really good part.

73
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:19,889
An audition?
Why didn't you call?

74
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:23,194
Honestly, because I had to go to
10th Avenue to get the script

75
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:24,762
and then I went
and talked to Fanny,

76
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:26,997
you know, who teaches
my auditioning class.

77
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:28,299
You're very good at auditions.

78
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,800
Not as good as the girls
who get parts.

79
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,873
You know what?
Let's talk about your day.

80
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:38,643
Well, I was gonna watch Carson
and cry myself to sleep.

81
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:40,778
It'll come to you.

82
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:44,049
- It always does.
- Unless it comes to you.

83
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,384
Do you really want help
or do want to yell at me?

84
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,818
I don't know yet.

85
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:50,555
What's the strategy?

86
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,892
A Jaguar is beautiful,

87
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,260
but unreliable.

88
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,596
It comes with a tool kit
the size of a typewriter.

89
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,665
You basically have to own
another car to go places.

90
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,034
So we're saying it's
your gorgeous mistress.

91
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:07,439
So a wife is like a
Buick in the garage.

92
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,408
We're trying to make
a weakness into a strength.

93
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,578
- We're selling to men.
- No, I got it.

94
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:15,415
Doesn't being a mistress
make the car immoral?

95
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,316
The word mistress
won't be in the ad.

96
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:21,187
I don't know,
but it sounds great.

97
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,760
I need to learn some of this.

98
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,130
<i>( TV playing )</i>

99
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,868
Joan:
<i>You're here early.</i>

100
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,803
What can I do for you?

101
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,107
Nothing.

102
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:43,143
Nothing, it's just I got
some bad news last night

103
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,746
and I was hoping
you'd help me deliver it.

104
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,381
What happened?

105
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:50,417
Well, we were having dinner
with Herb Rennet.

106
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:52,953
I think you met him
the other day, from Jaguar.

107
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:56,189
- Handsome guy.
- I don't remember any of them.

108
00:05:56,224 --> 00:05:58,159
Well, I don't know what to do.

109
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,595
He basically pledged
he wasn't going to back us.

110
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,230
Why not?

111
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,966
Turns out he wanted something
we're not prepared to give.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,369
Something very unorthodox.

113
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:09,238
Caroline: <i>- Good morning.</i>
- Yes?

114
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:11,974
I'm here.
I'm going to get Danish.

115
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,676
What does he want?

116
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,080
Uh...

117
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:19,916
I feel like I shouldn't
even bring this up.

118
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,818
In fact, I don't know
how to bring this up.

119
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:25,187
But we're going to lose Jaguar

120
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:28,291
unless an arrangement
is made, and

121
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:30,260
it involves you and,

122
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:33,196
well, Herb.

123
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:36,566
How did that come up?

124
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:40,136
He said he was crazy about
you and then he just asked.

125
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:42,705
And then I thought
we were past it,

126
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,375
but right before
we put him in a cab,

127
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,445
he said it again and it
was quite conditional--

128
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,881
A night with you or no vote.

129
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,317
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

130
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:57,454
Anyway, if you can think
of some way to break the news

131
00:06:57,488 --> 00:07:01,125
to the company that we're out of
this, I'd really appreciate it.

132
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:03,593
You're unbelievable.

133
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,230
I'm married.

134
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:07,265
How would you feel
if someone asked Trudy?

135
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,835
I didn't bring this up.
He did.

136
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:14,539
If you're not interested
in the idea at all,

137
00:07:14,573 --> 00:07:17,209
I appreciate--

138
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:19,010
It's just--

139
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:22,113
It seems to me that there's something
that could be worth the sacrifice.

140
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:24,817
We're talking about
a night in your life.

141
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,919
We've all had nights in our lives
where we've made mistakes for free.

142
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:30,421
You're talking about
prostitution.

143
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:33,392
I'm talking about
business at a very high level.

144
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,995
Do you consider Cleopatra
a prostitute?

145
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,530
Where do you get this stuff?

146
00:07:38,565 --> 00:07:40,799
She was a queen.

147
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:43,435
What would it take
to make you a queen?

148
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:46,906
I don't think
you could afford it.

149
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:59,085
This was an act of desperation.

150
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:01,321
I hope I haven't insulted you.

151
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,423
That's all that matters to me.

152
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:06,093
I understand.

153
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:11,465
Scarlett, we're ready.

154
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,368
Now, we can't get Ginsberg
out for the call,

155
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:16,136
we want you to pretend
you're his junior.

156
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,906
- Partner?
- Supervisor.

157

00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:26,747
Hi, Rick.
It's Kenny.

159
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:30,084
I'm here on a speaker with
Harry Crane and Peggy Olson,

160
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,186
Mr. Ginsberg's
supervisor,

161
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,722
and we want to know
why you want to pull the ad.

162
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,457
- <i>Hello, everyone.</i>
- Hi, Rick.

163
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:39,028
- Hello.
- <i>We're very happy with the work,</i>

164
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:41,397
<i>but sales have leveled</i>
<i>off since the holidays.</i>

165
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:44,967
It's Harry. And you know
Valentine's day is coming up.

166
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,901
A girl can't get a guy flowers.

167
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:50,005
<i>Why would a woman buy a man
anything for Valentine's day?</i>

168
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:54,576
Rick, it's Peggy.

169
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,913
I think you're right.
The target of "A Hard Day's Night" was men,

170
00:08:57,914 --> 00:09:00,116
but we can easily change that.

171
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:01,985
<i>How do you do that?</i>

172
00:09:07,123 --> 00:09:08,492
<i>Hello?</i>

173
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:11,528
What if it's our
leather jacket hero

174
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:13,997
running down the street
being chased by screaming girls

175
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:16,099
and, instead of jumping
into a bar,

176
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:19,336
he comes upon Lady Godiva
on a horse

177
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,539
as naked as we are
allowed to make her?

178
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:26,443
And he stops short,
but she leans down

179
00:09:26,478 --> 00:09:28,546
and picks him up
and puts him on the horse

180
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:30,949
and rides away with him.

181
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:34,318
<i>What's the tagline?</i>

182
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:38,590
It's something about
how, you know,

183
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:42,627
the right woman
loves Chevalier Blanc.

184
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:46,866
<i>So it's exactly the same</i>
<i>except for the ending?</i>

185
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,668
And maybe Paris
instead of London.

186
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:52,904
<i>Ooh-la-la.</i>
<i>A French song.</i>

187
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:00,679
Close the door, please.

188
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:08,320
Herb Rennet has demanded
to spend a night with Joan.

189
00:10:08,354 --> 00:10:10,523
And I don't mean
dinner and dancing.

190
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:16,062
He just came right out
and said that?

191
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,263
Who is he?

192
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:19,098
He's the head of
the dealers association.

193
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,833
And I hope you told him
to take a long walk.

194
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,701
There's three votes.
We only need two.

195
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,771
I thought about that.

196
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:27,441
But all he has to do is say he
can't sell cars with our campaign

197
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:30,477
and neither marketing
nor the factory will fight him.

198
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:33,680
- So?
- So I brought up the subject with Joan.

199
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:36,216
- You what?
- Now, relax.

200
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:38,952
She seemed more amused than
shocked.

201
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,155
And it's my opinion, if we
brought her the right amount...

202
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:43,925
So you thought you'd have us in here
for coffee and talk about this?

203
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,927
What's the problem
if she's amenable?

204
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:47,428
She said she'd do it?

205
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:49,829
She said we couldn't afford it.

206
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,438
She has a husband in Vietnam
and a baby at home.

207
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:59,074
And the work will be good
enough to win on its own.

208
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:01,642
- Plus, it's not a guarantee.
- No, it's not.

209
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:04,679
It's a guarantee
we won't get it if we don't.

210
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:06,714
You have some nerve
to even ask her.

211
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:09,250
That's right.
And you should be thanking me

212
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:11,152
because we've come too far
and are too close

213
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,789
to turning this place
into what it should be.

214
00:11:13,823 --> 00:11:16,092
Now we're going to walk away?

215
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:17,793
Over what?

216
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:21,363
He's one guy and we can win it without him.
End of discussion.

217
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:28,437
Speaking of one guy,
how does everyone else feel?

218
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:31,508
I'd love to approach
her with, say,

219
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:34,211
a 10% finders fee on
the first year's commission.

220
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:36,445
That's $50,000.
A flattering amount

221
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,914
which begs no negotiation.

222
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:42,620
I'm not going to stand in the way,
but I am not paying for it.

223
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:44,955
Not even with
our Christmas bonuses?

224
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,659
Maybe Jaguar
wasn't meant to be, hmm?

225
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:52,395
I say we take our
bonuses and move on.

226
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,999
This is a car.
You cannot put a dollar figure

227
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,767
on its significance.

228
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,837
Extend our credit line.

229
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:01,106
Say it's for Jaguar.

230
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:10,081
Well, why don't I...

231
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:13,184
Look into it to see
what we can afford

232
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:15,520
so you may approach her
in the morning

233
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:18,190
with something definitive?

234
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,395
So, we're 75% of this company.

235
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:25,997
There's no need to create a conspiracy
by having a vote, is there?

236
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:29,718
Don't fool yourself. This is
some very dirty business.

237
00:12:31,138 --> 00:12:34,106
Let her know
she can still say no.

238
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:49,169
<i>( Ball bouncing )</i>

239
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,941
You know what?
We're not doing this mistress thing.

240
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,944
It's vulgar.
We're going back to racing heritage.

241
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:59,480
- Why?
- People that writers horse around

242
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:01,015
because they're coming up
with ideas.

243
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,550
But, actually, it's because
they're horsing around.

244
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,719
Now knock off the grab-ass
and give me some lines.

245
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:07,389
And don't try to reuse these.
They do not apply.

246
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,264
Hey, skipper.
You got five seconds?

247
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:19,200
Five seconds is not
enough time to sit down.

248
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:22,438
Good news. Chevalier Blanc
wants to do a pool-out.

249
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:25,107
- Great.
- Peggy was incredible.

250
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:27,476
She came up with this
Lady Godiva bit on the spot.

251
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,579
But in the end, we're doing the
same ad as before, but in Paris.

252
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:32,714
The guy has a Beret.

253
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,718
Bid it out.
Ginsberg should be free by then.

254
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:36,920
Be nice to get him here.

255
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:39,522
Ginsberg?
I thought of this.

256
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:42,825
- It's his account. - So I guess
I'm not in charge of everything.

257
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:45,462
Jesus, Peggy, you know what?

258
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:48,765
You want to go to Paris?
Here.

259
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,099
Go to Paris.

260
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:14,625
- I'm not crying.
- I didn't think that.

261
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:18,462
What, we're all suddenly
interested in each other's lives?

262
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:21,264
I know for a fact that
Jaguar's not going to happen.

263
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,834
And he probably does, too.

264
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:25,704
- I don't care.
- I'll get you to Paris.

265
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:28,439
And if I don't,
we'll both get out of here.

266
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:30,975
( Scoffs )
You and your stupid pact.

267
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,479
Save the fiction
for your stories.

268
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:44,891
<i>( Knocks on door )</i>

269
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,025
What can I do for you?

270
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:48,226
May I?

271
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,168
( Groans )

272
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:58,771
Signing Jaguar
would be disastrous

273
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:00,607
for the financial health
of this company.

274
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:03,943
You have to stop being afraid.

275
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:07,446
It would be a defining
moment for our business.

276
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,885
We don't want it that badly.

277
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:15,889
- All right, get out.
- It bears discussion.

278
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:19,225
I don't know what you're talking about.
Now get out.

279
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,595
Well, I'm sorry that
there was a discussion.

280
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,099
But when a company is
planning on spending $50,000,

281
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,436
there needs to be a discussion.

282
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,605
You were all in there
talking about it?

283
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,207
Why does it matter if you
have no intention of action?

284
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:36,242
I don't want them
to know I was asked.

285
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,982
Roger Sterling participated
in this discussion?

286
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:43,451
Yes.

287
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,319
He's a partner.

288
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:48,356
If you're against it, why did
you tell me that number?

289
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,258
Sounds like a joke.

290
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:54,796
Because that may be enough
money to turn your head,

291
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,000
and I wanted a chance
to discourage you.

292
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:00,469
It is a lot of money, Lane.

293
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,771
It's four times
what I make in a year.

294
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:05,574
I suppose you wouldn't
even be tempted.

295
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:09,444
Well, if I were,

296
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:12,547
I would try to avoid
the mistake

297
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:14,817
that I've made my entire life.

298
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:17,520
Every time someone's
asked me what I wanted,

299
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:22,425
- I've never told them the truth.
- And what would you want?

300
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,760
Three years ago

301
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:29,465
when I was essential
to the future of this firm,

302
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,803
I settled for much less
than I needed.

303
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:37,642
The cash would only
cripple the company

304
00:16:37,676 --> 00:16:40,444
and would do very little
to change your future.

305
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:43,580
But a partnership

306
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:47,685
yielding a 5% stake
in the company itself...

307
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,822
Could take care
of a woman and a child

308
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:53,691
for a lifetime.

309
00:16:55,094 --> 00:16:57,029
Here I thought
you were trying to stop this

310
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,464
because you have
feelings for me.

311
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,635
That's why I'm looking
out for your interests

312
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,270
over the company's.

313
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,455
"Good night, nobody.

314
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,658
Good night, Mush.

315
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:31,130
And good night to the old lady

316
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,632
whispering 'hush.'"

317
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:39,238
( taps )

318
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:41,508
Hey.

319
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:50,549
( Laughing )

320
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:53,386
How's it going?

321
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:55,923
You want to help us out?
Throw some taglines at the wall?

322
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:58,525
How about, "Jaguar,

323
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,394
it's your problem,
not mine."

324
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:02,130
( Laughs )

325
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,645
May I speak with you?

326
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:11,106
So that's Megan.

327
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,174
Be careful what you say.
We're best friends.

328
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,079
So you're wearing
your audition dress.

329
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:20,449
What are you hoping
I can do for you?

330
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:23,251
You noticed.

331
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:32,828
I've only bad associations with
letting you leave the house in that.

332
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,564
There's probably 20 girls.

333
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:37,632
And Julia's coming with me.

334
00:18:37,666 --> 00:18:40,569
Plus, he's a fairy.

335
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,805
( Chuckles )

336
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:53,983
So whatever this is,
it's not for me.

337
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:56,152
I want to walk in
there with confidence.

338
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:10,733
- ( Growling )
- ( Men laughing )

339
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:17,341
I could be in a bikini and you
could paint my body with spots.

340
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,443
Jaguar, try to tame it.

341
00:19:19,477 --> 00:19:22,446
- Don't try and tame it.
- Here, kitty, kitty.

342
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,747
- ( Growling )
- ( Laughing )

343
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:27,518
So she just comes and goes
as she pleases, huh?

344
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:29,553
Ginsberg.
What?

345
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,289
Yeah, I got it.

346
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:34,458
( Sighs )

347
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,723
You can unplug that
if you want.

348
00:19:47,757 --> 00:19:50,492
Aren't I interrupting
your routine without me?

349
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:52,092
Don't be cranky.

350
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:56,331
( Sighs )
I was in a great mood when I left work.

351
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,967
Now I'm just exhausted.

352
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:00,902
So let's go to bed.

353
00:20:00,936 --> 00:20:03,772
If and when we get Jaguar,

354
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:05,842
I'm going to need
an apartment in the city.

355
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:07,576
Absolutely not.

356
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,612
It's an epic poem
for me to get home.

357
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:13,014
And you're dressed
for bed at dinner.

358
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:14,984
Peter.

359
00:20:15,018 --> 00:20:17,052
Let's stop playing games.

360
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,588
What are you talking about?

361
00:20:18,622 --> 00:20:20,256
I'm tired of competing.

362
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,224
Your love affair
with Manhattan is over.

363
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:26,061
Well, how can you stand living
out here in this cemetery?

364
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:29,031
There's nothing to do.
There's no good night noises anywhere.

365
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:31,801
Because I want to raise
my child in the fresh air.

366
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:33,537
And we should
have another on the way.

367
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:35,806
I mean, it was a miracle the first
time and we're not even trying.

368
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,709
I'm using all my energy
putting my foot down.

369
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:45,949
( Sighs )

370
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:48,351
<i>( Door opens )</i>

371
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,123
It's 8:00.
Where were you?

372
00:20:52,157 --> 00:20:54,859
What's that smell?

373
00:20:54,894 --> 00:20:56,860
The refrigerator
is on the fritz.

374
00:20:56,895 --> 00:20:59,663
- I had to take everything out.
- Did you call someone?

375
00:20:59,697 --> 00:21:01,966
His wife won't let him
come here anymore.

376
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,868
I don't want to talk
about that.

377
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:07,238
We can afford to have someone else fix
the refrigerator, for God's sake.

378
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:09,140
Why won't anyone believe me?

379
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:11,276
Apolo and I are just friends.

380
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,445
- Ahem.
- <i>You know what?</i>

381
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,414
Just hire someone.
Get a colored girl in here.

382
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,616
They're used to
being bossed around.

383
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:22,087
Do whatever you want.

384
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:25,658
And what are you doing?
Drying up inside?

385
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:29,260
Because of what?
Greg? I hate him.

386
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:32,064
I don't want you talking
that way around Kevin.

387
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:35,367
He's a baby. He doesn't know that
we all wish his father was dead.

388
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,673
Please, stop.

389
00:21:39,707 --> 00:21:42,408
Have you been drinking?

390
00:21:42,443 --> 00:21:44,276
Yes.

391
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:46,579
Sit down.

392
00:21:56,991 --> 00:22:00,226
"Little Murders" called.
Four of us got callbacks.

393
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,862
I'm supposed to go meet
the playwright tomorrow.

394
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:04,197
That's fantastic.

395
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,302
- That's a big deal.
- I know.

396
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:10,838
You have to promise you'll
come visit every weekend.

397
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:12,807
You're going to
Broadway, not jail.

398
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:15,442
No, rehearsal starts
in Boston in 10 days.

399
00:22:15,477 --> 00:22:19,013
- Oh, forget it. I'm getting
ahead of myself. - Boston?

400
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,884
Yeah, I think there's eight weeks
of rehearsals plus previews.

401
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,789
So you're just gonna leave
for three months?

402
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:30,392
- If they want me.
- Well, forget it.

403
00:22:32,328 --> 00:22:34,295
What do you think this is?

404
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,100
You think I'm gonna be
a singing waitress.

405
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:40,135
Maybe put on a show
in the laundry room?

406
00:22:40,169 --> 00:22:41,936
I have to go to work.

407
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,206
You never thought about it because
you didn't expect me to make it.

408
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,644
This is the way it works.
Now you know.

409
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:53,982
Just keep doing whatever
the hell you want.

410
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:57,219
<i>( Door slams )</i>

411
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:01,290
Please, come in.

412
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:08,298
You didn't have to make
an appointment, you know.

413
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:10,567
Yes, I did.

414
00:23:11,868 --> 00:23:13,602
Tell them I want a partnership,

415
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:15,305
not silent,

416
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:17,874
comprising 5% of the business.

417
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:22,179
- Well...
- There's no negotiation.

418
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,850
Okay.

419
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:29,619
I want documents
by the end of the day.

420
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:31,688
I don't know
if that's possible.

421
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:33,958
Well, I'm not
guaranteeing results.

422
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:37,061
I don't think he'll have trouble performing.
He's quite ardent.

423
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:39,163
I meant winning the business.

424
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:42,032
Yes, of course.

425
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,969
So, I have instructions, but
I don't know how this works

426
00:23:45,003 --> 00:23:46,770
in a practical sense.

427
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:48,973
The presentation's
tomorrow, isn't it?

428
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,742
So I just call him

429
00:23:51,776 --> 00:23:53,745
and have him call you?

430
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:55,981
Probably not.

431
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:58,683
Well, how do I--

432
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:00,351
Figure something out.

433
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:02,221
Do I have to do all of it?

434
00:24:14,635 --> 00:24:16,435
Which one is he?

435
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:18,437
He's not bad.

436
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:21,508
He's doing this.

437
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,914
- <i>( Knocks on door )</i>
- Come in.

438
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:30,350
I know I'm not a manager,
but it's very hard

439
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:32,619
to get things done
with you in another room.

440
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:35,022
Well, I obviously have
the opposite feeling.

441
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:37,223
Permission to speak freely?

442
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:39,059
What?

443
00:24:39,093 --> 00:24:41,996
I know you forbid us from
thinking about the mistress,

444
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:44,899
but I kept imagining the asshole
who's gonna want this car.

445
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:47,068
Now he's probably already
got a lot beautiful things.

446
00:24:47,102 --> 00:24:49,435
Or maybe he thinks the car
will help him get them.

447
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,338
So I can go on?

448
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:57,344
And one way or another,
what he has isn't enough.

449
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:00,615
So no matter what,
the first idea has got to be

450
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,518
finally, like, you're
getting what you wanted.

451
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:07,789
The copy is still describing
the car as another woman.

452
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:10,392
But a woman you can't have,

453
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,495
because they have all
the qualities of a Jaguar--

454
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:16,065
Good-looking,
expensive, fast,

455
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:18,835
and, frankly, not practical.

456
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:21,036
I've always been fine
with all that.

457
00:25:21,071 --> 00:25:22,671
But what's the line?

458
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:27,442
"Jaguar, at last,

459
00:25:27,476 --> 00:25:30,747
something beautiful
you can truly own."

460

( Laughs )

461
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:42,826
So he threw the money
in your face?

462
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,562
I don't even want
to talk about it.

463
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:49,767
I've never had
more responsibility.

464
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:51,736
I'm on everything but Jaguar.

465
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,104
I worked on Plymouth
at NW Ayer.

466
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:56,541
Car guys are a bunch of creeps.

467
00:25:56,575 --> 00:25:58,710
They're all a bunch of creeps.

468
00:25:58,744 --> 00:26:03,013
Could I get some more coffee?

469
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:04,716
I can never tell, ballerina,

470
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,219
if you're ambitious
or you just like to complain.

471
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:09,120
Why can't it be both?

472
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,291
Well, if this was about
work and not feelings,

473
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:15,494
you'd make a move.

474
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:17,095
You're right.

475
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,800
I could take a couple of meetings and get
an offer and throw that at Don's face.

476
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:24,403
Or you can do
what everybody else does--

477
00:26:24,437 --> 00:26:27,740
Have a bunch of meetings,
pick a place and leave.

478
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:29,708
Don't think I haven't
thought about it.

479
00:26:29,743 --> 00:26:33,146
Well, you'd get to find out

480
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,850
if you could shine elsewhere.
And I know you can.

481
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:40,353
And you'd let him know that
you're not some secretary

482
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:43,022
from Brooklyn who's
dying to help out.

483
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:49,496
I don't know if I can do that.

484
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,131
Sure you could.

485
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,133
You could hire a headhunter

486
00:26:53,168 --> 00:26:56,804
or you could buy
a friend a piece of pie.

487
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:02,811
Of course, if you do move,
you can't complain

488
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:05,113
if I gave Draper a call
on my own behalf.

489
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:06,948
What if Don finds out
you helped me?

490
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:08,983
Don's a big boy.

491
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,985
If he was having this
conversation with you

492
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,721
and he wasn't
the subject of it,

493
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:15,023
he'd tell you
to leave in a second.

494
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:27,292
I've seen the campaign and it's
something I couldn't have imagined,

495
00:27:27,326 --> 00:27:29,361
yet exactly what I expected.

496
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:30,995
Thank you.

497
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,865
And I want you to present
in the fullest confidence.

498
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:35,066
I think it's a winner.

499
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,203
Well, all I wanted to say

500
00:27:38,237 --> 00:27:40,806
was we've removed
all other impediments.

501
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,176
But you do know
no matter what else goes on,

502
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,878
it's the creative
that's going to win this.

503
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:49,481
Close the door.

504
00:27:51,017 --> 00:27:53,018
It was four to zero.

505
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:55,621
You abstained in absentia.

506
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:58,857
The conversation doesn't end
just because you leave the room.

507
00:27:58,892 --> 00:27:59,959
What did you promise her?

508
00:27:59,994 --> 00:28:02,629
A 5% stake as a voting partner.

509
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:05,231
Dawn, can you
buzz Mrs. Harris?

510
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:07,032
She's not here.

511
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:10,170
Actually, Dawn,
could you get my things?

512
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:14,874
Yes, you should be well rested.

513
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:18,212
I don't want it like this.

514
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:20,981
It was her idea.

515
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:28,355
Hello.

516
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,857
Hello.
I'm Don Draper.

517
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:31,492
I work with Joan.
Is she in?

518
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:34,262
Yes, of course.
Please come in.

519
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:41,269
Joan:
<i>What?</i>

520
00:28:49,445 --> 00:28:51,412
She'll be right with you.

521
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:54,216
- I should take your coat.
- I won't be long.

522
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:01,089
Well, I will leave
you two alone.

523
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,663
I'm really sorry to bother
you if this is a bad time.

524
00:29:07,697 --> 00:29:09,632
Well, I was just stepping
into the shower,

525
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,134
but how can I help you?

526
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:13,803
I wanted to tell you
it's not worth it.

527
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:17,741
And if we don't get
Jaguar, so what?

528
00:29:19,076 --> 00:29:21,278
Who wants to be in business
with people like that?

529
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:30,454
I was told
everyone was on board.

530
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:34,357
I said no and they voted
when I left the room.

531
00:29:36,728 --> 00:29:39,830
You're a good one, aren't you?

532
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:41,832
So you understand
what I'm saying?

533
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:45,704
Yes, I do.

534
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,440
I'm all right.

535
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:52,009
And thank you.

536
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:55,314
So you have a nice night.
And I'm gonna go prepare.

537
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:08,760
- Say good night to your friend.
- Good luck tomorrow.

538
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:31,951
Don: <i>You must get tired of hearing
what a beautiful thing this car is.</i>

539
00:30:31,985 --> 00:30:34,254
But I've met a lot
of beautiful women in my life.

540
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:36,923
And despite
their protestations,

541
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,892
they never tire of hearing it.

542
00:30:40,328 --> 00:30:43,530
But when deep beauty
is encountered,

543
00:30:43,565 --> 00:30:46,800
it arouses deep emotions

544
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:50,204
because it creates a desire,

545
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:53,374
<i>because it is, by nature,</i>
<i>unattainable.</i>

546
00:30:53,408 --> 00:30:55,409
You look radiant, Joan.

547
00:30:55,443 --> 00:30:58,079
May I call you Joan?
I'm Herb, by the way.

548
00:30:58,113 --> 00:31:00,749
Well, I should hope so.

549
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:04,286
We're taught to think that
function is all that matters.

550
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,322
But we have a natural longing

551
00:31:07,357 --> 00:31:09,523
for this other thing.

552
00:31:09,557 --> 00:31:12,827
Oh, I got you
a little something.

553
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,704
I thought a woman
with your complexion

554
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:23,639
would look good in emerald.

555
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,974
When I was driving
the e-type,

556
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,243
I passed a 10-year-old boy in the
back window of a station wagon

557
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:30,213
and I watched his eyes follow.

558
00:31:30,247 --> 00:31:32,648
He'd just seen something
he would want

559
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,918
for the rest of his life.

560
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:37,686
I feel like a sultan of Araby

561
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:41,391
and my tent is graced
with Helen of Troy.

562
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:43,927
Those are two
different stories.

563
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:46,162
Don: <i>He'd just seen that
unattainable object</i>

564
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,299
speed by just out of reach.

565
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:51,168
Because they do that,
don't they?

566
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:53,304
<i>Beautiful things.</i>

567
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:58,842
You know, I don't know how much
longer I can restrain myself.

568
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:23,868
Let me see 'em.

569
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:27,440
Then I thought about a man of some
means reading "Playboy" or "Esquire"

570
00:32:27,474 --> 00:32:29,540
and flipping past the flesh

571
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:33,945
to the shiny painted curves
of this car.

572
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,548
There was no effort
to stop his eye.

573
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:41,053
The difference is
he can have a Jaguar.

574
00:32:43,991 --> 00:32:46,559
Well, thank you
for a wonderful time.

575
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,963
You're a hell of a gal.

576
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,133
Don:
<i>Oh, this car,</i>

577
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:56,704
this thing, gentlemen,

578
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:59,673
what price would we pay?

579
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:03,275
What behavior would we forgive?

580
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,881
If they weren't pretty,
if they weren't temperamental,

581
00:33:06,915 --> 00:33:08,549
if they weren't
beyond our reach

582
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:10,551
and a little
out of our control,

583
00:33:10,585 --> 00:33:12,352
would we love them like we do?

584
00:33:14,857 --> 00:33:17,090
"Jaguar,

585
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:21,629
at last something beautiful
you can truly own."

586
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:34,876
( Knocks )

587
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:37,045
What?

588
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:39,514
Mr. Draper is here
to see you.

589
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:41,516
Why'd you tell him I was here?

590
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:44,319
He's your boss.
You should see him.

591
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,370
Well, I will leave
you two alone.

592
00:34:05,341 --> 00:34:08,010
I'm really sorry to bother
you if this is a bad time.

593
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,145
Well, I was just stepping
into the shower,

594
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,481
but how can I help you?

595
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:14,517
I wanted to tell you
it's not worth it.

596
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,554
And if we don't get
Jaguar, so what?

597
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:20,390
Who wants to be in business
with people like that?

598
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,165
How'd it go?

599
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,736
We'll see.

600
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,705
It was one of his good ones.

601
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,541
- Come have a drink?
- Maybe later.

602
00:34:54,424 --> 00:34:57,326
- Where are you from?
- New York.

603
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:03,132
<i>Turn around, please.</i>

604
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:06,370
Could you step forward, sweetheart,
and turn around, please?

605
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,453
You know, I would have
taken you anywhere.

606
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:25,090
Well, no one comes in here.
The food's too bad.

607
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:27,525
We're not actually gonna
eat here, are we?

608
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,027
I'm not hungry.

609
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:31,129
Freddy Rums says you are.

610
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:32,998
And so does Tom Vogel.

611
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:34,632
You know we have Clearasil.

612
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,303
In fact, he sung your praises

613
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:40,006
while he was yelling at me that
the work wasn't as good anymore.

614
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,347
That was my first account.

615
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,313
Everybody else is gonna
wanna know if you're married

616
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:48,114
or planning on having a baby.

617
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:50,850
And then they're gonna want to
know how much you want to be paid.

618
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:53,286
But all I want to know is,

619
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,424
you must have heard
some pretty terrible things

620
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,225
about me
from Don Draper's mouth.

621
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:00,894
But why would you want
to play for the other team?

622
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:03,262
It's not a game.

623
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:06,033
It's my career.

624
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:08,135
Look, I need a writer.

625
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:10,304
They don't have
to be like me, but...

626
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:12,907
Do you know anything
about Ralph Waldo Emerson?

627
00:36:12,941 --> 00:36:14,975
Uh....

628
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:16,644
From school.

629
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:20,748
He said that you have to be
a transparent eyeball.

630
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:23,551
What he meant was,
you have to take in the world

631
00:36:23,585 --> 00:36:26,621
and pass it through you.
I am tired of people

632
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:28,323
who treat this like math.

633
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:31,792
I looked at your book
and I saw somebody

634
00:36:31,827 --> 00:36:34,963
who was writing like
every product was for them.

635
00:36:34,997 --> 00:36:37,866
No cliches, no homilies,

636
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,068
no formula.

637
00:36:40,102 --> 00:36:43,205
Well, I had a lot of help.

638
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:45,508
Everybody does.

639
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:47,742
So I lied to you.

640
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:50,812
What do you want to get paid?

641
00:37:00,123 --> 00:37:01,757
Freddy told you to do this?

642
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:15,238
You already know
you want to go.

643
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:18,508
You know how much
you'll do it for.

644
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:21,210
And you didn't make me wait.

645
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:23,881
I'm going do you
the same favor.

646
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:36,927
- Oh.
- If this is your last meeting.

647
00:37:39,764 --> 00:37:42,600
( Sighs ) I think I
need a chocolate shake.

648
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,036
( Laughs )

649
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:48,606
First day of work ends with
you and me at La Caravelle.

650
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:56,313
- You're here.
- I'm here.

651
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:00,786
How'd it go?

652
00:38:10,764 --> 00:38:12,765
How did yours go?

653
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,934
We're waiting to hear.

654
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:17,335
I bet you were great.

655
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,139
I bet you were, too.

656
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:23,709
The difference is
I want you to get it.

657
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:24,944
Stop it.

658
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:27,245
Well, you get to disappear
for work whenever you want.

659
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,150
And if I have to choose
between you and that,

660
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:34,520
I'll choose you.

661
00:38:34,555 --> 00:38:38,559
But I'll hate you for it.

662
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:40,994
You know I don't want
you to fail.

663
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,129
Good.

664
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,331
Because I'm not going to.

665
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:54,108
- Don't run away like that.
- Shh.

666
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:08,624
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

667
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:11,558
Miss Olson wants to see you.

668
00:39:11,593 --> 00:39:14,428
Peggy, come on in.

669
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,635
- D'arcy's out.
- Says who?

670
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:21,703
Arthur's girl told me
on the QT.

671
00:39:21,738 --> 00:39:23,204
She said he was in
his office crying.

672
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,875
Jaguar is calling the
president of every agency.

673
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:28,543
- Dancer just got a big "no, thanks."
- D'arcy is out, too.

674
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:31,146
<i>( Phone ringing )</i>

675
00:39:33,883 --> 00:39:36,819
Get the partners in my office and
wait for further instructions.

676
00:39:41,725 --> 00:39:44,127
Roger Sterling's office.

677
00:39:44,161 --> 00:39:46,629
I want all the partners here.

678
00:39:46,664 --> 00:39:47,997
You can't leave him on hold.

679
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:50,366
Where's Pete?

680
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,735
Just answer it.

681
00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:00,176
Roger: <i>Hello?</i>
<i>Hugh, how are you this morning?</i>

682
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:04,148
I'm glad to hear that.
We like him, too.

683
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:09,019
- Well, that is terrific news.
- Bravo.

684
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:10,954
- Spectacular.
- Great.

685
00:40:10,989 --> 00:40:13,892
We'll be over this afternoon
to kiss the bride.

686
00:40:13,926 --> 00:40:15,492
( Laughs )

687
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:17,027
He said it wasn't even close.

688
00:40:17,062 --> 00:40:19,396
( Laughs )

689
00:40:22,902 --> 00:40:26,104
- Well, congratulations to everyone.
- We got to get champagne.

690
00:40:26,138 --> 00:40:28,539
I promise you they're
opening it right now.

691
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:31,475
Before everybody's too drunk,
I need a list of names.

692
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,246
I promised them we'd staff up immediately
and we're going over there today.

693
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,382
Can't we wait to see what the
scope of the campaign will be?

694
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:40,151
Is this about
the bonuses again?

695
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:42,922
There are no bonuses this year.

696
00:40:42,956 --> 00:40:44,557
Now, next year ( Laughs )

697
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,328
<i>( People cheering )</i>

698
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:51,897
Joan, shall we address the men?

699
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,123
- Congratulations.
- You wanted to talk to me?

700
00:41:16,157 --> 00:41:18,292
You're not busy?

701
00:41:20,161 --> 00:41:21,729
I'm not in the mood.

702
00:41:21,763 --> 00:41:24,598
You really have no idea
when things are good, do you?

703
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:41,383
I swear, I don't really
need to talk right now.

704
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:42,784
Drink with me.

705
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:50,626
I have to talk about
something kind of serious.

706
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:56,364
I can't put a girl on Jaguar.

707
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:58,768
These car guys...

708
00:41:58,802 --> 00:42:01,203
I just can't.

709
00:42:01,237 --> 00:42:03,372
- But, you know--
- It's not that.

710
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:05,608
Is this about Joan
being made partner?

711
00:42:05,642 --> 00:42:07,511
What?

712
00:42:07,545 --> 00:42:10,246
The circumstances...

713
00:42:10,281 --> 00:42:12,882
She's been with us 13 years.

714
00:42:19,891 --> 00:42:22,392
( Exhales )

715
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:26,831
I want you to know that

716
00:42:26,865 --> 00:42:29,533
the day you saw
something in me...

717
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,603
My whole life changed.

718
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:38,376
And since then,
it's been my privilege

719
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,178
to not only be at your side,

720
00:42:41,213 --> 00:42:44,381
but to be treated
like a protegee

721
00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:47,219
and for you to be my mentor

722
00:42:47,253 --> 00:42:49,587
and my champion.

723
00:42:53,692 --> 00:42:55,027
But?

724
00:42:55,062 --> 00:43:00,232
But... I think
I've reached a point

725
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:03,101
where it's time for me
to have a new experience.

726
00:43:03,135 --> 00:43:04,803
Really?

727
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:07,539
I'm giving my notice.

728
00:43:07,574 --> 00:43:10,109
I've accepted another offer.

729
00:43:11,911 --> 00:43:15,614
- Are you done?
- I'm giving the customary two weeks.

730
00:43:15,648 --> 00:43:18,851
My last day will be the third.

731
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:21,153
- And don't think--
- Hold on.

732
00:43:22,389 --> 00:43:24,358
( Sighs )

733
00:43:24,392 --> 00:43:27,761
It's been crazy around here and I know
I've been taking you for granted.

734
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:30,296
And, frankly, I'm impressed.

735
00:43:31,664 --> 00:43:34,801
You finally picked the right
moment to ask for a raise.

736
00:43:34,835 --> 00:43:37,905
It's time for me to move on.

737
00:43:37,939 --> 00:43:40,140
Come on.

738
00:43:40,174 --> 00:43:43,144
I'm serious.

739
00:43:47,648 --> 00:43:49,283
You're serious?

740
00:43:49,317 --> 00:43:51,519
It wasn't easy.

741
00:43:51,553 --> 00:43:53,087
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.

742
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:57,558
Well, good for you.
Where are you going?

746
00:44:08,805 --> 00:44:11,106
Okay.

747
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:14,944
Well, let's pretend
I'm not responsible

748
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:18,079
for every single good thing
that's ever happened to you,

749
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:21,784
and you tell me
the number or make one up

750
00:44:21,819 --> 00:44:23,786
and I'll beat it.

751
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:27,289
- There's no number.
- There's no number?

to play this out?
