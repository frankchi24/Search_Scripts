You're acting crazy!

As usual, you have
acted impulsively!

Most of your questionable
behaviour is beyond explanation.

You are not allowed to be
alone with clients.

You are to stick

I found it on
the Xerox machine.

I suppose it probably sounds
like an emergency,

but it's not. I thought
of you because, well--

it's not an emergency.

No, that's what you are.

He doesn't eat the
burgers, he cooks them.

139

But what if you replaced
him with a fresh recruit?

He can't work

he's Mort Drucker.

— Mort Walker.
— How'd you get this?

153
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:39,107
It wasn't our fault. Why is
Scout always up to no good?

154
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,875
He peeled a bag of grapefruits.

— Thought they were potatoes.

I'm gonna get rid of this.

157
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:47,782
He left it on the Xerox. He
obviously wanted us to have a copy.

158
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:49,951
You're just gonna
force me to draw my own.

I've got a plane to catch.
Get to work.

161
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:59,895
Naw, he's gonna
stroke to 'em later.

162
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,969
Why don't you let
Loretta do that?

163
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:08,271
She can handle the homework.
I'll handle the silver.

164
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:11,209
What'd you land on?

165
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:14,876
Rumaki, Crab Louie
on toast points,

166
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,979
and little franks
in barbecue sauce.

167
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:19,584
You know they've got four more
houses to visit after us?

168
00:08:19,618 --> 00:08:22,319
I wanted to go first
to put everyone at ease.

169
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:24,153
They get so
tongue-tied around us.

170
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:27,259
They can only pretend so long
we're just «regular neighbors.»

171
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:31,397
Could you stock the bar?

172
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:34,699
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

173
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:37,667
Hi. Did you have
any trouble finding us?

174
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:39,936
No.

175
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:46,144
I'm Megan, by the way.

176
00:08:46,178 --> 00:08:48,647
I'm Stephanie.

177
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:54,189
You are so beautiful.

178
00:08:54,224 --> 00:08:55,857
I know, I'm a Madonna.

179
00:08:57,126 --> 00:09:01,096
But you are truly magnetic.

180
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:02,364
What do you do?

181
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,167
Don didn't tell you?
I'm an actress.

182
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,106
Uh, welcome.

183
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:11,409
I'm grateful.

184
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:13,409
For some reason,
I'm not crying, man.

185
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,313
Well, why don't I fix
you something to eat

186
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,215
and then you can take
a shower if you want?

187
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:19,615
— Is it that bad?
— No!

188
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,451
I don't know.

189
00:09:21,486 --> 00:09:23,156
I think you'd want to relax.

190
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,126
Don didn't say much about your
situation other than the obvious.

191
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:29,196
Your place is out of sight.

192
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,565
I'm at a flop
in MacArthur Park,

193
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:34,170
but I'm headed up to Oakland
with a little help.

194
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,706
I have some friends there and one
of them's old man's a doctor.

195
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,408
So, assume
it's no trouble at all.

196
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:42,508
What's your pleasure?
Grilled cheese? Spaghetti?

197
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:46,113
Do you have any meat?
I've been dreaming about it.

198
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,051
( laughs )
Sure.

199
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:50,619
Now you go into the bedroom
back there.

200
00:09:50,653 --> 00:09:52,588
I changed the sheets.
There are towels.

201
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,687
You can lie down, run a bath,

202
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:57,490
whatever you want.
Make yourself at home.

203
00:09:57,524 --> 00:09:59,959
Thank you.
I'm pretty beat.

204
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,375
You know I want her.

205
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:15,411
You can't have her.

206
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:17,078
Why can't I have her?

207
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:19,479
Because Scout's on 'er.

208
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:22,015
<i>( toilet flushes )</i>

209
00:10:45,672 --> 00:10:47,373
Nice of you to join us.

210
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,516
Don, why don't you take the
mound, throw out the first pitch?

211
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,315
Sure.

212
00:10:56,349 --> 00:11:00,354
Stan has some
very preliminary work.

213
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:02,422
Stan?

214
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:05,592
Should I move over there or do
you want to come over here?

215
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,894
I don't know, Stan. Can you
be smug from over there?

216
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,464
Lou, I don't know
what you think you heard.

217
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:13,266
I heard everything!

218
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,371
From your first fart
to your last dying breath.

219
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:19,006
— ( chuckles )
— You think it's funny?

220
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,442
I apologize deeply.

221
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:23,378
What happened?

222
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:25,345
Let me ask you, Peggy.

223
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:27,545
— You ever heard of Underdog?
— The cartoon?

224
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,714
Yeah.
Sweet Polly Purebred.

225
00:11:29,749 --> 00:11:31,183
Saturday morning.

226
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:33,119
It makes hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year.

227
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:36,555
Mostly for its creator Chet
Stover of Dancer Fitzgerald.

228
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,225
— Did you know him there?
— He was nothing special.

229
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:41,794
«Scout's Honor»
is 100 times better.

230
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:45,025
I can tell you right now,
it's a winner.

231
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:49,695
You know who had a ridiculous
dream and people laughed at him?

232
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:53,127
— You?
— ( laughs )

233
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,829
What?

234
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:57,533
Oh, I did not mean that
the way it sounded.

235
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,070
I mean, if you're telling us
that this is your dream,

236
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:04,271
I apologize for being one
of those naysaying idiots.

237
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,739
I hate people like that.

238
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:09,476
Bob Dylan.

239
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,214
Is he hip enough for you?

240
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:13,549
He was 20 years old when he
wrote «Blowin' in the Wind»

241
00:12:13,584 --> 00:12:15,617
and he's a genius.

242
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,985
Look at where he is,
look at where you are.

243
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,788
( stifled laugh )

244
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,491
You know what?

245
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,026
You're a bunch of
flag-burning snots.

246
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,428
You've got a thing to learn
about patriotism and loyalty.

247
00:12:27,462 --> 00:12:30,534
The very fabric of «Scout's
Honor» is a joke to you.

248
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:33,636
We're gonna have
this meeting later.

249
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,775
So order dinner because
I want finished work.

250
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,478
And if any of you
don't like it,

251
00:12:39,513 --> 00:12:42,012
you can thank your
hilarious friends here.

252
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:01,431
Last flight's at 9:00.
Put me on that.

253
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:04,066
— I'll cancel my plans.
— Just mine, not yours.

254
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,300
I don't know if it's vandals

255
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:09,236
or just kids being kids.

256
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,804
What is it?

257
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:13,340
Someone broke all the
streetlights on Peck Avenue.

258
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:15,040
And you want Henry
to get them fixed?

259
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:18,109
No. Mike was just saying
it's a national disease.

260
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:20,077
The wildness of the kids.

261
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:21,945
I just don't expect it
in Westchester.

262
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:25,114
I know all everyone wants
to talk about is Vietnam,

263
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:28,384
but things are
falling apart here, too.

264
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:30,451
The rumaki is exquisite.

265
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:32,452
Thank you.

266
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:35,324
Well, I don't know, that
those things are unrelated.

267
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,159
I mean, first the kids
start off protesting

268
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,197
and the next thing you know every
authority is up for grabs.

269
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:43,933
I mean, if they learned
how to support their country,

270
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,967
sacrifice in hard times, we'd
have the morale to win the war.

271
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:49,804
Mike, you have plans
for the summer?

272
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,509
Even Nixon wants to bring
the war to an end.

273
00:13:52,544 --> 00:13:54,344
I'm surprised, Henry.

274
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:56,747
Don't be, Mike.
I agree with Nixon.

275
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,948
I think it's too costly.

276
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:00,717
It has to be done
on the right terms,

277
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:02,652
but I think we should get out
while the getting's good.

278
00:14:02,686 --> 00:14:04,352
Since when?

279
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,854
I've always supported
the president, honey.

280
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,331
I think that maybe everyone
should fill up here.

281
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,701
I don't know
if my lamb turned out.

282
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:16,636
I'm sure it's delicious.

283
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,771
Let me check the Sterno.

284
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:25,576
( knocks )

285
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,115
Well, I think I worked
every side of the strategy.

286
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,657
Don, you've been the boss.

287
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:36,994
The briefcase and the hat,
that's a rookie maneuver.

288
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:38,696
You got someplace to be?

289
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,029
I'm afraid I do.

290
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:43,233
How's it going to look
for them if I let you go?

291
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:44,835
Well, you could let
everybody go.

292
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,337
Is that what you would do?

293
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:49,074
No, I'd let<i> you</i> go, Lou.

294
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,145
Well, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

295
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,314
I'm gonna do you the
courtesy of reading these

296
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:59,650
so that you can continue to work on them
instead of coming up with new things,

297
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:02,153
because I'm gonna
tuck you in tonight.

298
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:07,658
About your cartoon.

299
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:09,626
Here we go.

300
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,828
This is an office made out of people
who have problems with authority.

301
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:15,597
You know you have to have a thick
skin, but don't help them.

302
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:19,067
I'm not taking management
advice from Don Draper.

303
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:26,174
( phone ringing )

304
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:29,780
Hello.

305
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:31,848
I can't get out
of here tonight.

306
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:34,182
Oh, I'm sorry.

307
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:37,153
— Is she there yet?
— She's taking a bath.

308
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:38,389
How is she?

309
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:40,158
She's pretty far along.

310
00:15:40,193 --> 00:15:42,963
So beautiful.

311
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:46,335
Well, don't bother her. Tell her
I'll see her in the morning.

312
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,374
Don't worry.
I made her a steak.

313
00:15:48,408 --> 00:15:50,075
Thank you.

314
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:56,444
Okay, I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

315
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:57,813
Okay.

316
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:01,850
Damn, that smells good.

317
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:06,089
Don's stuck in New York. He's
flying in tomorrow morning.

318
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:08,324
Was that him?

319
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:11,029
Yeah, he's frustrated.
I told him not to worry.

320
00:16:12,566 --> 00:16:14,268
Wait, do you want
to eat outside?

321
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,636
I do that all the time.

322
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:21,739
I love that you're
wearing Anna's ring.

323
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:24,244
Oh, yes.
It's beautiful.

324
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:28,514
I'm sorry I never met her.

325
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:30,750
She's around.
Believe me, you've met her.

326
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:32,920
She's happy it's in the family.

327
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:36,155
Well, maybe you'll have
someone there to give it to.

328
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:38,123
Oh, no.
It's yours now

329
00:16:38,158 --> 00:16:39,825
You'll probably have
someone of your own.

330
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:42,731
We'll see.
I don't know.

331
00:16:42,765 --> 00:16:45,468
Don's kids are plenty for me.

332
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:47,371
( sighs )

333
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:49,307
I haven't eaten meat in a year.

334
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,276
I don't think
this is a good idea.

335
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,142
I can make spaghetti.

336
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:57,446
It's probably hard
with you here and him there.

337
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,850
Are you with someone?

338
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:04,052
Not right now.
He was a musician.

339
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:05,687
They're the worst.

340
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:08,860
Dropped out of school.
Followed him down here.

341
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,962
Started flush at the beach,

342
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,632
ended up downtown panhandling.

343
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,506
And then he got busted
dealing grass

344
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,275
and we celebrated
before he went away.

345
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:21,611
He'll be out in a month.

346
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:24,549
So will this little guy.

347
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,217
Does he know?

348
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:27,585
No.

349
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,953
I'm afraid he'd murder
someone just to stay in jail.

350
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,889
— I won't tell Don.
— Oh, I don't care.

351
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,624
I know all of his secrets.

352
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:44,899
But you don't
know<i> him</i> very well.

353
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:47,633
You're right.
You're right.

354
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,503
It's just I'm looking at you

355
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,504
and seeing how, well,
disorganized this all is.

356
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,105
And I don't think
he'd stand for that.

357
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,543
I don't think he'd trust you
to make your own plans.

358
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,349
I don't know what I'm doing here.
This is a dumb idea.

359
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,587
No, no, I mean,
he wants to help,

360
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,521
I'm sure, in his way.
We both do.

361
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,033
I'm going to give you...

362
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:29,671
would $1,000
get you far enough?

363
00:18:29,706 --> 00:18:32,507
That's very generous.

364
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:35,009
This comes with no strings.

365
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:38,676
Thank you.

366
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:44,883
I really think
it's better this way.

367
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,054
You're right.
I'm gonna take off.

368
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,589
You haven't eaten anything yet.

369
00:18:49,623 --> 00:18:52,723
I guess I got what I came for.

370
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,359
There's no rush.

371
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,701
Nothing ever happened
between us, you know.

372
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:01,904
Of course not.

373
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:04,938
You're his niece.
I know that.

374
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:18,712
( door slams )

375
00:19:18,747 --> 00:19:20,248
The children are asleep.

376
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:23,419
— What about your headache?
— Keep your voice down.

377
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,322
I did not appreciate going stag

378
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:27,958
to four people's homes
whom I barely know.

379
00:19:27,993 --> 00:19:31,297
I'm sorry. I wasn't feeling well.
You didn't have to go.

380
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,633
Hey, «Emily Post.»

381
00:19:34,668 --> 00:19:36,634
Why were you
talking about the war?

382
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:38,466
I didn't bring it up.

383
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,700
But maybe I should more because
I didn't know where you stood.

384
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:42,102
I shouldn't have to brief you

385
00:19:42,136 --> 00:19:44,471
because you shouldn't be
talking about those things.

386
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:46,239
I'm not a dinner companion.

387
00:19:46,273 --> 00:19:47,640
I'm their elected
representative.

388
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:50,341
— You ran unopposed.
— We'll see if that lasts.

389
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:52,442
From now on, keep your
conversation to how much you hate

390
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:55,378
getting toast crumbs in the butter
and leave the thinking to me.

391
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,050
Henry!

392
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:03,187
I'm sorry. It just
caught me off-guard.

393
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:06,324
Well, you embarrassed
yourself way more than me.

394
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:12,566
<i>( door slams )</i>

395
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,802
You know what?

396
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:23,138
I decided I can
see that Monday.

397
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:26,570
Good night.

398
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,285
( phone ringing )

399
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,791
Hello.

400
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:48,224
What?

401
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,395
Is she okay?

402
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,596
( water running )

403
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,571
Hello?

404
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:03,939
Oh, hi.

405
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:08,076
— Who are you?
— I'm Amy.

406
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:10,745
— We met on the phone.
— Is Megan here?

407
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,047
Oh, Don.
I...

408
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:14,849
Amy, do you mind?

409
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:17,453
I'll just use the ladies'.

410
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,624
I'm sorry, but she left.

411
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,729
You told her
I wanted to see her?

412
00:21:25,763 --> 00:21:27,366
I really tried
to get her to stay.

413
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,668
But the money already came up

414
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,400
and I gave her $1,000.

415
00:21:31,435 --> 00:21:33,369
She must have been embarrassed.

416
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:35,571
She said she'd call
you from Oakland.

417
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:38,007
You should have called me.
At least let me talk to her.

418
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:40,111
She's an adult, Don.

419
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,450
Do you want to go
to the market with us?

420
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:48,518
You know, I'm gonna
have company tonight.

421
00:21:48,552 --> 00:21:50,186
Maybe it'll cheer you up.

422
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,989
We'll go.
Amy.

423
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,428
— Is everything okay?
— Yes.

424
00:22:00,462 --> 00:22:02,697
— We should go.
— Anything for you, Don?

425
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:05,100
I know what he likes.

426
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,241
<i>( computer humming )</i>

427
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:14,445

00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,687

432
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,935
We're back.

433
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:20,907
— Let me see.
— She's fine.

434
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,574
Couple of black eyes.

435
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:26,843
Ow.
Can I go lie down?

436
00:23:26,877 --> 00:23:28,644
I want to know
what really happened.

437
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,945
They were sword fighting
with golf clubs.

438
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:33,449
— We're idiots, okay?
— You are.

439
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:35,186
You can't be
trusted on your own.

440
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,421
That's your face, young lady.

441
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,324
That's right, it's<i> my</i> face.

442
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,729
— Why am I even here?
— Girls! Girls! Please.

443
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:45,268
Sally, you can understand how your mother
and I are both worried about your nose.

444
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:48,639
Yeah, I know, because where would
Mom be without her perfect nose?

445
00:23:48,673 --> 00:23:50,643
She wouldn't find
a man like you.

446
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:52,546
She'd be nothing.

447
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,849
It<i> was</i> a perfect nose.

448
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:56,615
And<i> I</i> gave it to you.

449
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,619
You're lucky Henry
is important enough

450
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,655
to get Dr. Kramer
to fix it this weekend.

451
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,225
I suppose you'd rather do
it in a barn in Farmington.

452
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:05,594
It's a nose job,
not an abortion.

453
00:24:05,628 --> 00:24:08,296
— I'm going to break your arm next.
— Betty!

454
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,030
Don't worry about me
finding a man.

455
00:24:10,063 --> 00:24:12,064
I already have you
to keep me in line.

456
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:14,968
You're going to your room and you're
going to wait there until morning.

457
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:17,336
Good, I prefer it.

458
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:32,748
Hello.

459
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:34,715
Just a minute.

460
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,282
It's for Megan again.

461
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:38,717
Megan?

462
00:24:38,752 --> 00:24:40,886
It's Greenblatt's.

463
00:24:43,387 --> 00:24:44,586
Hello.

464
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,621
<i>( knock on door )</i>

465
00:24:52,628 --> 00:24:55,430
The main door was open and you
didn't check the peephole?

466
00:24:55,464 --> 00:24:56,698
It's a bad neighborhood.

467
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:57,933
What are you doing here?

468
00:24:57,967 --> 00:24:59,700
I wanted to tell you--

469
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:01,601
May I?

470
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,270
Michael.

471
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:05,708
I was just in the office and
there's something going on.

472
00:25:05,742 --> 00:25:07,344
— What?
— The computer.

473
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:10,378
It's Saturday.
Take the day off.

474
00:25:10,413 --> 00:25:12,512
That's right. So why
were Lou and Cutler

475
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:14,580
having a secret meeting in
that air-conditioned lair?

476
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:17,486
— I don't know.
— But I do.

Okay.

— Hey.

486
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:39,180
I'd like to say Peggy's mentioned
you at work, but she hasn't.

Very modern.

Can I please work here?
I can't go back to the office.

Not right now.
I'll stay out of your way.

Fine.

Hi, Miranda.

This place is out of sight.

But then I'm not

a pillow to the den.

You want to run away?

The kid left an hour ago.

561
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:05,976
It's interesting because
first you were dead,

562
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,513
then all this activity
started in your eyelids.

563
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:10,282
Time to go.

564
00:31:10,316 --> 00:31:12,516
There's this pressure
in my head

565
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,984
like there's a hydrogen
bomb that's gonna go off.

566
00:31:15,018 --> 00:31:18,989
And then I realize
it's that hum in the office.

567
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,759
It's getting to me.

568
00:31:20,794 --> 00:31:22,326

569

without having sex, I'd do it.

Great. What am I doing?
It's building up.

577
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,603
Well, maybe you should
see a doctor or something.

doesn't work in there anymore?

That's not my imagination.

00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:55,743
It's just a computer!

583
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,554
No, you're right.

584
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,721

It's gonna take some thought.

It's gonna take
some major brain power.

In fact, you might
have to figure it out.

I think the solution here

Oh, this is the final solution.

Commander who?

No, Commander cigarettes.

How long has this been going on?
Is there work?

Don't make me sorry I told you.
