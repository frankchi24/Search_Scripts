2
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,839
Oh, my God.
You have to taste it.

3
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:52,674
Shouldn't we wait for Don?

4
00:00:52,726 --> 00:00:55,059
Chateau Margaux '53.

5
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:57,178
Considered by some
the best there is.

6
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,981
So, you were talking
about Ziploc.

7
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:01,482
Was I?

8
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:04,686
Yes. You were saying that
we might be in the running.

9
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:08,489
No, I said I was still deciding.

10
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:11,192
I see. So you would
like to know why

11
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:13,328
the agency that has
over-performed on Handi-Wrap,

12
00:01:13,363 --> 00:01:14,746
Oven Cleaner, Bathroom Cleaner,

13
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:18,700
and corporate image cleaner,
is worthy of more business?

14
00:01:18,752 --> 00:01:21,536
Well, I don't know about
Bathroom Cleaner.

15
00:01:21,588 --> 00:01:24,088
"Germ killer"? It makes
people think of shit.

16
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:26,090
You didn't express that.

17
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:28,593
I expressed ambivalence

18
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:30,295
and you went the wrong way.

19
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:35,516
Yes, of course. So would you
like us to redo the work?

20
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:38,937
As I said, Pete,
I haven't decided.

21
00:01:41,808 --> 00:01:44,475
Please, Ken, don't get up.
I apologize.

22
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:46,644
I couldn't get a cab.

23
00:01:46,696 --> 00:01:49,948
I should let you try
Ken's incredible wine.

24
00:01:49,983 --> 00:01:52,367
But first, I think you should
know that Ken prefers

25
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:54,986
the "bright and shiny"
bathroom strategy

26
00:01:55,038 --> 00:01:58,489
because he says "germ killer"
makes people think of poop.

27
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,940
Don't have second thoughts, Ken.
You picked the right strategy.

28
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:04,662
Okay.

29
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:06,247
Okay?

30
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,166
Should we order?

31
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:13,755
<i>Good evening, Mr. Draper.</i>

32
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:15,506
<i>You have three phone calls.</i>

33
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:17,175
<i>One at 7:00
from Tricia Reynolds</i>

34
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:20,762
<i>and two from Diana Baur
at 9:00 and 9:30.</i>

35
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:22,897
Diana Baur?
What's the message?

36
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:26,184
I'm sorry, what was the message?

37
00:02:26,186 --> 00:02:28,269
<i>Actually, I see here.</i>

38
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:30,104
<i>I wasn't supposed to give
you her second message.</i>

39
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:31,856
<i>Or her first.</i>

40
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:35,026
<i>My goodness. Why don't
they just throw these out?</i>

41
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:36,527
Do you know who spoke with her?

42
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,864
<i>Yes, and I'll report this.
I work with birdbrains.</i>

43
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,950
No, it's fine.
I just...

44
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,003
Did she leave a number?

45
00:02:45,038 --> 00:02:47,538
<i>No. I'm sorry.</i>

46
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:51,793
Will you let everyone know I'll
pick up my own calls tonight?

47
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:53,261
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

48
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,680
<i>And again, I apologize,
Mr. Draper.</i>

49
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:57,632
Good night.

50
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,390
Caroline!

51
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:10,228
Do you read the mail
or do you just open it?

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,980
Shirley opened the mail.
I'll get her.

53
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:15,616
No, go get whoever is responsible
for paying our lease.

54
00:03:15,652 --> 00:03:17,568
Dawn Chambers.

55
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,490
Joan!

56
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,409
Get in here!

57
00:03:24,411 --> 00:03:25,994
Joan!

58
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:29,163
Don't do that.

59
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,165
You're gonna have to fire Dawn.

60
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:32,667
She didn't pay the lease.

61
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:39,557
I'll take care of this.

62
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:02,580
<i>I have Trudy Campbell.</i>

63
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,954
Well, hello, Trudy.
How are you?

64
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:12,423
Frankly, not good at all.

65
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:14,375
What did I do?

66
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:16,210
<i>No, it's Tammy.</i>

67
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:18,463
She was on the wait list
at Greenwich Country Day

68
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:21,466
and they promised her admission,
but they didn't keep their word.

69
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:23,468
What was she doing on
the wait list at all?

70
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,270
My father's entire family
went to that school.

71
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,722
They know who are you, Peter.

72
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:29,107
And they know who I am.

73
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:30,975
And they know
that we're divorced.

74
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:33,861
Greenwich, Connecticut,
is built on divorced money.

75
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:35,446
Don't yell at me.

76
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:37,482
I've arranged for a meeting
with the headmaster

77
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:39,067
and I'd like for you
to accompany me to show

78
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,452
that we're in this together,
if nothing else.

79
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:44,655
Yes, of course.

80
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:45,990
Tomorrow.

81
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:48,793
Just once, I'd like some notice.

82
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:51,129
I didn't want
to involve you at all.

83
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:03,174
You got me this time, Kirby.

84
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:06,310
You're all fired.

85
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:08,513
Hold on.

86
00:05:08,515 --> 00:05:12,567
Someone at McCann-Erickson
gave notice in writing.

87
00:05:13,686 --> 00:05:15,486
I was never informed.

88
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:18,189
We were never informed.

89
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:21,325
Well, it's obviously a mistake.

90
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:24,695
Get Jim Hobart... no, Ferg
Donnelly on the horn.

91
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,831
Just a minute.

92
00:05:26,866 --> 00:05:29,033
Ladies, this is how
rumors get started.

93
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:31,619
So this stays in this room
till things get sorted out.

94
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:34,455
Back to work.

95
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,709
I'll get Ferg.

96
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,301
So now I just want you to play.

97
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:52,023
Just pretend we're not here.

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,983
I'm giving you
my permission to play

99
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:03,901
with all these great toys.

100
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:06,237
Do what you would do
if we weren't watching.

101
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:12,243
Really?
That's what you'd do?

102
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,547
What's wrong with them?

103
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:18,749
You said you didn't want actors.

104
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:22,053
Well, real kids are shy.

105
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:24,422
And you have to talk
to them like people.

106
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:30,178
They all have their own toy.

107
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,396
If we want enthusiasm,
we should just have one toy.

108
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:34,182
Like a battle royale.

109
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:36,851
Just throw one in there and the
last kid standing gets the gig.

110
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:38,903
It would work.

111
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:42,106
You hate kids.

112
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:44,992
You know what? I want to see
how far you can throw that.

113
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,279
Take it easy.

114
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:55,503
Rog, I'm on my way to lunch.
What can I do for you?

115
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:56,954
It'll just take a second.

116
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,839
Someone over there accidentally
gave notice on our lease

117
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,124
and I need you to fix it.

118
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:02,126
Oh.

119
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:05,263
Well, actually...

120
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:07,548
Actually what?

121
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,469
You really need
to talk to Jim about it.

122
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:15,056
About what? What the
hell is going on, Ferg?

123
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:16,974
Roger, calm down.

124
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:19,193
I think you'll see
it's all good news.

125
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,980
Go ahead.

126
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:27,401
Well, we're gonna move
your whole office

127
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:28,986
into our building
at the end of the month.

128
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:30,988
Why?

129
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
We don't mind paying people,

130
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:34,959
but it seems ridiculous
to rent two floors

131
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:37,514
of the Time Life Building when we
have plenty of space over here.

132
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:40,414
Hold on, are we
losing the office

133
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,083
or the agency?

134
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:44,051
That's the wrong way
to look at it.

135
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:45,636
We're bringing you home.

136
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:47,421
This is my home.

137
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:49,640
Are you dissolving us?

138
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:51,559
I'm gonna set a meeting
with Jim for tomorrow.

139
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:56,180
Look, this was supposed to be the
last thing done, not the first.

140
00:08:01,738 --> 00:08:03,738
Were you planning this
all along?

141
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,407
Would you stop it?
It's going to be great.

142
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:10,695
<i>Roger.</i>

143
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,369
What do I do?

144
00:08:22,592 --> 00:08:24,759
Can I help you?

145
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:26,844
Really pulled one over on us.

146
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,962
Who?

147
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:32,550
What are you doing here?

148
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:34,635
Roger, you can't just tell Don.

149
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:37,054
- Tell Don what?
- Do you need ice?

150
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:39,357
We're not to be disturbed.

151
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:46,063
- Go ahead.
- No.

152
00:08:48,284 --> 00:08:51,235
McCann's moving us
to their building.

153
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,453
We lost our lease.

154
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:54,622
Everything must go.

155
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:01,162
So we're moving?

156
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:03,331
I'd love a new view.

157
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:05,616
No, Pete, I don't think
that's all there is to it.

158
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:07,451
We're being swallowed up.

159
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,220
We have 30 days.

160
00:09:09,255 --> 00:09:11,505
SC&P has conflicts.
That's why we exist.

161
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:13,758
Don't you understand?
We don't exist.

162
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,676
Our rent is too high.

163
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:23,934
- Anybody else?
- Yes, please.

164
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:27,521
That's it?
Have a drink?

165
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:30,024
Well, I'm not going.

166
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:32,243
You want to give up
the rest of your money?

167
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,829
We all have four-year
contracts and a noncompete.

168
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,280
I did not agree to this.

169
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:37,865
Yes, you did.

170
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:40,284
The minute we sold them the
company, we all agreed to it.

171
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:43,704
After all that, Jim Cutler wins.

172
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:45,756
All that cash and no McCann.

173
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,425
I hate that guy.

174
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,627
I like it over there.

175
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:50,928
Because you're a sheep.

176
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:52,630
Knock it off.

177
00:09:52,632 --> 00:09:54,965
We've got a meeting
with Jim Hobart tomorrow

178
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:57,852
to discuss the details.
Let's try and be dignified.

179
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,137
Keep it in this room
until we have orders.

180
00:10:08,948 --> 00:10:11,282
That explains
the forecast they wanted.

181
00:10:13,319 --> 00:10:15,069
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:17,655
They waited so long,
I thought we were safe.

183
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,165
Betsy Wheeler.

184
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:32,837
Okay, Betsy,
I'm glad that's you.

185
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:38,092
Peggy, may I speak with you?

186
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:41,262
- Maybe later.
- It's very important.

187
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,649
I'll be right back.

188
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:01,499
What's wrong?

189
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,345
I'm telling you this because...

190
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,047
I don't know,
because no one else will.

191
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,216
And you really need to know.

192
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:23,888
We're being absorbed by McCann.

193
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:30,694
Are they letting me go?

194
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,696
No, they'll need you
for a while.

195
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:34,365
Maybe forever.

196
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,283
All I know is having
a leg up on the rats

197
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,069
who fly off this ship
is going to help you.

198
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,821
I would want it.

199
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:42,907
Oh.

200
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,546
Are you going?

201
00:11:48,581 --> 00:11:50,247
I have to.

202
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:55,836
I've never worked anywhere else.

203
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:00,975
You'll do great.

204
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,346
You should get back to work.

205
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:11,185
For your ears only.

206
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,166
Hello. It's me.

207
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:29,370
I love a call from you
in the middle of the day.

208
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:32,206
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

209
00:12:32,258 --> 00:12:35,593
Even better.
What do you want me to say?

210
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:39,346
I got some bad news at work.

211
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:42,216
Hey.

212
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:45,352
I don't care how bad it is.
It's not that bad.

213
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:47,888
You don't know that.

214
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,641
We can talk about it
tomorrow when I'm there.

215
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:52,476
I didn't know you were coming.

216
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:56,196
Lisa, get me on
the redeye to New York.

217
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,033
Now you know.

218
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:13,490
Melanie called. She has two two
bedrooms to show you tonight.

219
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:16,159
And it's five minutes till
the Mohawk status meeting.

220
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,328
Cancel everything.

221
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,946
What's wrong?

222
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:22,532
It's personal, honey.

223
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,342
Don Draper's office.

224
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:34,344
I'll see if he's available.

225
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:38,965
It's Lou Avery calling
from California.

226
00:13:39,017 --> 00:13:40,717
Shit.

227
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,604
I better take it.

228
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,641
Do you mind?

229
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:57,767
- Hello, Lou.
- Don.

230
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,836
I think we need
to have a conversation.

231
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,155
Look, we just found out.

232
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:06,076
I told Dee not to say
anything, but good you know.

233
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:07,627
I'm moving next week.

234
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,546
When did they tell you?

235
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:11,047
A couple weeks ago.

236
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,083
I thought about it for 10
seconds, then I thought,

237
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:16,386
"So what if it's Tokyo?
It's my lifelong dream."

238
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:19,339
They have an office in Tokyo?

239
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,892
They only have an office
in Tokyo.

240
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,144
What are you talking about?

241
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:26,513
Tatsunoko Productions.

242
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,648
They're making "Scout's Honor"
into a cartoon.

243
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,204
What did you think
I was talking about?

244
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,070
It doesn't matter.

245
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:36,406
They made "Speed Racer," Don.

246
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,942
I got a $15,000 advance.

247
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,827
Obviously, my mind's made up.

248
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,696
Obviously.

249
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,915
I wish I could see
the look on your face.

250
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,083
I bet you're not laughing
anymore, are you?

251
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,501
No, Lou, I'm not.

252
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:51,087
Well, sayonara, my friend.

253
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,290
Enjoy the rest
of your miserable life.

254
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,815
Meredith.

255
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,870
If we're trying to keep
the office calm,

256
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:25,488
closing those curtains
is a bad idea.

257
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,710
So spill it.
Have you heard something?

258
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:33,913
Yes, I did.
Lou's moving to Tokyo.

259
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm not even going to
tell you why

260
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,362
because it would
give him pleasure.

261
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:40,971
The point is Sterling
Cooper West is empty.

262
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,807
Of course it's empty. It's the
first drop out of the teapot.

263
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,675
What I'm saying is
it's available.

264
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,677
We can run a business
out of there.

265
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,396
We have no business.

266
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:51,181
I was looking at
McCann's rosters

267
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,817
and there's going to be
a lot of clients

268
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,769
they can't hold on to...
Conflicts.

269
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,687
Take Sunkist for example.

270
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,856
It's 10 million in billings
and growing.

271
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,275
Coca-Cola owns Minute Maid,
so Sunkist is gone.

272
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,160
Burger Chef, it's four million

273
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,329
and they just dumped
McCann for us.

274
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,531
They keep telling me
their future's in California.

275
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,368
Exactly. What's our
square footage out there?

276
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,703
1,485.

277
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:15,789
An old girlfriend measured it.

278
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,874
What I'm saying is there's
business in California.

279
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:19,709
If we can work out
of a bassinet,

280
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,928
we can make McCann money that
they'd have to throw away.

281
00:16:21,963 --> 00:16:24,798
"We"? I don't want
to go back to California.

282
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,384
That's good. You don't have to.
Stay here, they'd like that.

283
00:16:27,436 --> 00:16:28,852
Anyone else want to stay here?

284
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,854
Are we really playing this game?

285
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,356
Dow Chemical.

286
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,309
McCann fired Ken. And I mean
fired him out of a cannon.

287
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,694
He ain't going near that place.

288
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,562
- How much is that?
- Seven.

289
00:16:39,614 --> 00:16:41,281
But Ken doesn't like us either.

290
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:43,733
But he loves feeling the tip of
your nose in the seat of his pants.

291
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:44,951
I'll take care of Ken.

292
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:46,453
What about Avon?

293
00:16:46,488 --> 00:16:48,905
I'm sorry,
but it's not a conflict.

294
00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:50,824
But I have the relationship.

295
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,909
No, that would be
stealing a client.

296
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,578
Avon has to go to McCann and
you have to help them keep it.

297
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:00,300
We're going to hand deliver
all of the clients they want.

298
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:03,970
We're meeting with Jim Hobart
tomorrow and we can't cancel.

299
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,923
You think we can secure
three accounts in 24 hours?

300
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,092
We've done it before.

301
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,776
I'm sorry it's so hot in here.

302
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:28,995
I'm sorry about the intrusion,

303
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,582
but this is the only place where
we know we won't be seen.

304
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:35,001
Well, I'm comfortable here.

305
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:39,289
The question is,
how does it look out there?

306
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:42,041
Considering most firms
are Ivy League only

307
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,210
and you don't even
have a degree,

308
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:46,429
the landscape
looks very promising.

309
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,799
Who wants me?

310
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:51,801
Well, I can list
a bunch of initials

311
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:54,304
or I could tell you
what I really think.

312
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:56,473
You're the expert.

313
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,358
What's the best offer?

314
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,643
McCann-Erickson.

315
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:04,647
I don't want to go there.
That's why I called you.

316
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:06,533
I understand that.

317
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:09,486
Look, I'm foregoing
a commission here

318
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,155
because I'm a career builder.

319
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,959
I want to help you find a
job over and over again.

320
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,660
And sooner or later,

321
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:20,747
you're going to have to go
through a place like McCann.

322
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,166
Big company.
Big products.

323
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,918
National influence.

324
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,253
You shouldn't stay longer
than three years,

325
00:18:27,305 --> 00:18:28,922
but that's where you should go.

326
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,090
But what else is out there?

327
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,725
Plenty.

328
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:36,095
For a lot less money
with a lot less cachet.

329
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:39,899
But you go to McCann
and by 1973,

330
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,569
you'll be looking at
four times the salary.

331
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,072
So that's it?

332
00:18:46,107 --> 00:18:48,191
You could've just called
me and told me this.

333
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:50,527
I want you to consider
it seriously

334
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:52,612
before we take meetings.

335
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:56,783
Because word always gets out
and McCann is vindictive.

336
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,871
You're really selling it.

337
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:04,791
It's a huge opportunity.

338
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,388
Come in.
Glad you could make it.

339
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,473
- I feel like a spy.
- You look like one.

340
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:22,559
We have caviar.

341
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:24,894
Your favorite red.
Chateau Margaux '53.

342
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,446
I'll have a snort.

343
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:29,148
Look, ahem,

344
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,034
they're dissolving the agency.

345
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,902
All the business
is moving to McCann.

346
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:35,405
They finally got you.

347
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:37,574
They ate you up.

348
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:43,546
We know it was hard enough to convince
you to stay when McCann bought us.

349
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,748
I can't imagine how you
feel about things now.

350
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,500
Yeah, I'm not going.

351
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:49,586
So we are proposing

352
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:52,088
that we retain our independence
in our California office

353
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,341
with a few select clients
who've insisted on it.

354
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:57,760
Who else is going?

355
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,179
Burger Chef and Sunkist so far.

356
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,398
It's strictly for conflicts.

357
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,767
And, well, conflicts.

358
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:07,270
Tell your superiors
nothing is going to change.

359
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,157
I know I always
come at you guns blazing,

360
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:15,111
but to them, I'm still the
new guy and Ed's son-in-law.

361
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,363
I can't suggest
a move this bold.

362
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:20,116
Boldness is always rewarded,
am I right, Pete?

363
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:22,919
I don't want to make Ken do
anything he doesn't want to do.

364
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:26,789
Now he obviously thinks it's
less bold to change agencies.

365
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:28,591
You're wrong.
Dow would be thrilled

366
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,177
to finally have all their accounts
at McManus, John & Adams.

367
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:34,347
Kenny, you know that
we know this account

368
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,466
inside and out
and we have Don Draper.

369
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,134
That's why you stayed anyway.

370
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,303
That's true.

371
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:42,522
We've done this before.

372
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,190
You know we can.

373
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:49,228
You know,
I've fantasized that one day

374
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,814
I'd be in this situation
with you, Roger.

375
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:54,067
And, Pete, well,

376
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,735
you're not exactly
an innocent bystander.

377
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,790
I've toyed with you long enough.

378
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,160
No.

379
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:06,212
Sorry about that.

380
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,266
How do I describe California in a
way that doesn't make them jealous?

381
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,152
Tell them my ex-wife
lives there.

382
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:32,238
Mine, too, so what?

383
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:34,607
I know you're attached
to California.

384
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,493
I don't know what it means to you,
but it doesn't mean anything to me.

385
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,780
It does mean something to me.

386
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,667
I always feel bad
about taking your spot

387
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,536
when I saw what happened to you.

388
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,338
It should have been
you out there, not me.

389
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,708
You were very persuasive.

390
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,043
I was misguided.

391
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,466
I met someone.

392
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:05,722
She's not too young and she's
gorgeous and a little bit deep.

393
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,473
Where'd you find
a girl like that?

394
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:10,109
I knew her in college.

395
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,729
She's divorced, too,
but no kids.

396
00:22:14,065 --> 00:22:16,566
I bumped into her
on Third Avenue

397
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:19,736
and we couldn't remember
why it didn't work out.

398
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:21,738
Oh.

399
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,157
Congratulations.

400
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,910
I hope you understand, she can't leave
New York and I can't leave her.

401
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:30,246
Stop it. You're helping
us by staying here.

402
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,551
Roger called.
Dow's a no.

403
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,503
Let me talk to Ken.

404
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:40,173
I suggested that and Roger
said it's quite final.

405
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,642
Well, let's comb
through the small accounts.

406
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:45,678
See if we can cobble
a couple million together.

407
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,730
I'll go get the files.

408
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,927
Do you want more coffee?

409
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:58,629
I want to get on with this.
I have someplace to be, Trudy.

410
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:08,189
- Good morning.
- Peter Campbell.

411
00:23:08,241 --> 00:23:11,192
Sorry to keep you waiting.

412
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:18,082
Well, I assume you know why
we're here, Mr. MacDonald.

413
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:21,502
We feel there's been a mistake
regarding our daughter Tammy.

414
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:23,755
It's a Campbell family tradition

415
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:27,542
to receive the inimitable education
of Greenwich Country Day.

416
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:29,293
But you didn't go here.

417
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:33,714
No, but a Campbell has been in
attendance since it was a barn.

418
00:23:34,968 --> 00:23:38,302
I'm sorry,
but our decision is final.

419
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:42,974
Now, Trudy explained to me that you
said it's a question of space.

420
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:46,144
And I say Tammy would
make it worth your while.

421
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:48,146
She wouldn't feel extra at all.

422
00:23:48,148 --> 00:23:50,281
It's not a question of space.

423
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:54,235
Your little girl scored very
low on her draw-a-man test.

424
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:56,571
Well, that's news to us.

425
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:58,489
And I find it hard to believe.

426
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,042
Your ex-wife and I
discussed this.

427
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:03,661
<i>Children have to draw a man</i>

428
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:06,747
and their development is assessed
based on the volume of details.

429
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,551
Eyes, nose, ears, 10 fingers,
10 toes, et cetera.

430
00:24:10,587 --> 00:24:14,172
Your daughter had only a head,
mustache, and necktie.

431
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:17,091
- Mustache?
- She didn't understand what you wanted.

432
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:19,343
And I've been told anything
beyond a stick figure

433
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:21,813
is considered
advanced for her age.

434
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:25,516
Albert Einstein didn't speak
until he was four years old.

435
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:27,568
This is not about
your little girl.

436
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:32,106
The real problem
is that your former wife

437
00:24:32,158 --> 00:24:34,742
failed to submit applications
to other schools.

438
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,577
That was careless and arrogant.

439
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:39,030
- What?
- How dare you?

440
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:41,115
I think we've said
all there is to say.

441
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:44,619
We're not leaving until
you apologize to Trudy.

442
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:46,921
Peter, it doesn't matter.

443
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:48,422
Einstein.

444
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,875
Would you like to step outside?

445
00:24:50,927 --> 00:24:53,794
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
get me while I'm sleeping?

446
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:55,213
Like a real Campbell?

447
00:24:55,215 --> 00:24:56,881
Are you kidding me?

448
00:24:56,883 --> 00:24:59,267
No MacDonald will ever mix
with a Campbell.

449
00:24:59,302 --> 00:25:01,636
What are you talking about?

450
00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:04,472
It's some stupid story.
It's 300 years old.

451
00:25:04,524 --> 00:25:06,274
He's obviously nuts.

452
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:09,360
You should know that his clan took
advantage of the gift of hospitality

453
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:11,479
and murdered my ancestors
while they slept.

454
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:13,281
The king ordered it.

455
00:25:13,316 --> 00:25:16,817
Just be grateful you can remarry
and get rid of that name.

456
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,819
Oh.

457
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:23,291
Come on, Trudy.

458
00:25:23,326 --> 00:25:26,127
Another sucker punch
from the Campbell's.

459
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:27,662
Coward.

460
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:35,670
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
the auditions are finished.

461
00:25:35,722 --> 00:25:38,472
I already auditioned.
I'm waiting for my mother.

462
00:25:38,508 --> 00:25:40,224
Where is she?

463
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,476
She had to pick up my brother.

464
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:43,928
He has another audition.

465
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,347
Look, Phil, it's a very
simple transaction.

466
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:48,099
We've been doing it for years.

467
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:49,984
Shirley, will you watch her?

468
00:25:51,571 --> 00:25:53,321
I have every right to be upset

469
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:56,157
because I'm an important buyer and
you're acting like an asshole.

470
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:00,328
Maybe we should go downstairs.

471
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:02,947
I'll see if Marsha's
back from lunch.

472
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:04,498
Do you know your phone number?

473
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:06,367
Did I get the part?

474
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:10,454
We haven't decided.

475
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:14,542
Verna?

476
00:26:16,296 --> 00:26:19,630
Her purse is gone. They must be at
the park. You should ice that hand.

477
00:26:19,682 --> 00:26:22,300
No, this was a bad idea.
I really should get going.

478
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:25,469
It was a wonderful idea. Tammy
would love to see you by surprise.

479
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:30,141
Why did you only apply
to one school?

480
00:26:30,143 --> 00:26:32,643
I had a back up,

481
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:34,895
but...

482
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:36,814
I shouldn't tell you this.

483
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:41,369
You can tell me.

484
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:47,325
Well, the head of admissions
was a little fresh with me.

485
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:48,876
What school?

486
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:51,295
Peter, you can't punch everyone.

487
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:54,999
Maybe I should've
never left the city.

488
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:57,001
The city's become a toilet.

489
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:59,337
Well, it's difficult out here.

490
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:01,339
I don't have a lot of friends.

491
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:03,174
I don't believe that.

492
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:04,675
It's the husbands.

493
00:27:04,727 --> 00:27:06,427
I don't want to hear this.

494
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,062
Every time I want
to do something...

495
00:27:08,097 --> 00:27:10,014
Go into town,
any social event...

496
00:27:10,066 --> 00:27:11,515
They won't leave me alone.

497
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:16,404
Then I think, "Who am I kidding?"

498
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:19,857
In 10 years, everyone
will leave me alone."

499
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:22,026
That is not true.

500
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:24,195
You're ageless.

501
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:28,833
I'm feeling sorry for myself.

502
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:30,701
This has been an ordeal.

503
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:34,121
I'll solve the school
problem in 30 days.

504
00:27:34,173 --> 00:27:35,790
All it requires is a check.

505
00:27:35,842 --> 00:27:39,427
- Tell Tammy I love her.
- You never take no for an answer.

506
00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:46,183
- Actually, can I use your phone?
- Yes, of course.

507
00:27:50,857 --> 00:27:53,307
- Where's Pete?
- He may be meeting us there.

508
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:55,643
Good, I made it.

509
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:58,029
- You need anything?
- Not now.

510
00:27:58,064 --> 00:28:00,197
I just talked Secor
Laxatives into joining us.

511
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:04,285
- Go ahead.
- Where they difficult to move?

512
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,570
All I had to do
was not make that joke.

513
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:08,322
Shall we?

514
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:20,751
Hello, Susie's office.
How many I help you?

515
00:28:20,753 --> 00:28:22,803
Okay.

516
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:25,756
We got three boys, three girls.

517
00:28:25,808 --> 00:28:29,093
- Top picks.
- She has a lisp.

518
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,811
Lisps are cute.

519
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:33,431
We could pluck that eyebrow.

520
00:28:33,483 --> 00:28:35,766
You know what? I don't care.
You decide.

521
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:39,820
I know you don't mean that.

522
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:47,027
Okay.

523
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,246
You can't tell anyone.

524
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:52,199
- You can't even tell Elaine.
- That won't be a problem.

525
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:54,785
- Why?
- What is it?

526
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:58,005
McCann's taking over the agency.

527
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:01,041
We're moving over there.

528
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:03,377
- Jesus, to McCann?
- Shh.

529
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:08,182
- What happened?
- I stapled my thumb.

530
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:10,301
Oh, it's okay.

531
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:12,303
I know it hurts.
It happens all the time.

532
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:14,305
Oh, great.
Go get some ice.

533
00:29:14,357 --> 00:29:16,724
- You get ice, I'll pull out the staple.
- No.

534
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:18,526
Oh, here she is.

535
00:29:19,562 --> 00:29:21,312
It was an accident.

536
00:29:21,314 --> 00:29:24,031
- What is going on?
- I'll get the first aid kit.

537
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:27,451
- She stapled her finger.
- Susie Q, let mommy see.

538
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:32,990
- Very sorry.
- We're going to the emergency room.

539
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,992
It's not that bad.

540
00:29:35,044 --> 00:29:38,212
You shouldn't let a child
play with dangerous things.

541
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:41,298
You shouldn't have abandoned her
in a midtown office building.

542
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:44,084
It's nobody's fault.

543
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:46,137
I had to go pick up my son

544
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:48,088
because your audition
ran two hours late.

545
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:50,591
So you just left an eight
year old at a job interview?

546
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:53,093
This is her favorite thing.
She loves it.

547
00:29:53,146 --> 00:29:55,513
- And I bet you love cashing her checks.
- Peggy.

548
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:57,481
You do what you want
with your children,

549
00:29:57,517 --> 00:29:59,099
I do what I want with mine.

550
00:30:05,274 --> 00:30:07,625
How the hell did that
turn into that?

551
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,527
her.

552
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,531
I know you got other things
on your mind, but...

553
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,533
Let's just get back to work.

554
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:18,953
Sure.

555
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:33,210
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting,

556
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,762
but you're 20 minutes early.

557
00:30:34,797 --> 00:30:36,764
We just wanted
to get everything ready.

558
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,632
For what?

559
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:40,968
Gentlemen, would you
please have a seat?

560
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:50,227
You see that? We could use
some manners around here.

561
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,146
I don't know about that,

562
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:55,232
but we are here to discuss everything
we can add to McCann-Erickson.

563
00:30:55,234 --> 00:30:58,569
- So are we.
- Go on.

564
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:02,072
Our agencies compliment
each other in so many ways.

565
00:31:02,124 --> 00:31:05,326
But as we considered this union,

566
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:06,994
we were alarmed
at how much business

567
00:31:07,046 --> 00:31:08,996
we would all be giving up
due to conflicts.

568
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:11,215
There will be casualties.

569
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,251
Sunkist Orange Juice,
Burger Chef, Secor Laxatives,

570
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:15,886
and Tinker Bell Cookies
cannot come along.

571
00:31:15,922 --> 00:31:18,839
$18 million in billings.

572
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:23,644
But what if we could
service those clients

573
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,314
from the modest offices
of SC&P West?

574
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:34,155
The best part is we'd
still be available to you

575
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:36,106
in any capacity you wish.

576
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:43,447
California.

577
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,032
It's a gold rush out there.

578
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:47,001
In fact, we've made several...

579
00:31:47,036 --> 00:31:48,919
Don. Don.

580
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:51,755
Don, stop.
This isn't necessary.

581
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:54,041
Jim, would you let him finish?

582
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:58,679
- Can you give us a minute?
- Yes, absolutely.

583
00:31:58,714 --> 00:32:00,681
- Do you want this?
- No.

584
00:32:08,858 --> 00:32:11,976
This is $275,000 in profit.

585
00:32:12,028 --> 00:32:14,812
All cost covered that you don't
have to lift a finger to earn.

586
00:32:14,814 --> 00:32:18,315
Don, sit down.
Please.

587
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:32,663
I'm sick about the way
this was handled.

588
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:35,716
It made the whole thing
look very capricious.

589
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:38,335
I assure you, it wasn't.

590
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:41,505
And you have to believe me when I say
we're rolling out the red carpet.

591
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:43,674
We're very excited about this.

592
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:47,511
- You can understand our attachment to our clients.
- And our name.

593
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,147
I don't think you
understand what's happened.

594
00:32:50,182 --> 00:32:52,766
It's done.

595
00:32:52,818 --> 00:32:55,269
You passed the test.

596
00:32:58,357 --> 00:33:02,109
You are getting five of the most
coveted jobs in advertising.

597
00:33:02,161 --> 00:33:04,161
And all the resources
that go with it.

598
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:06,196
Travel, adventure.

599
00:33:06,248 --> 00:33:08,832
An international presence.

600
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:13,537
I shouldn't have to
sell you on this.

601
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:17,207
You are dying and going
to advertising heaven.

602
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:19,877
Buick.

603
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:24,631
Ortho Pharmaceutical.

604
00:33:28,304 --> 00:33:30,020
Nabisco.

605
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:39,063
Coca-Cola.

606
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:50,574
Stop struggling.

607
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:52,626
You won.

608
00:33:59,418 --> 00:34:01,635
Take the rest of the day off.

609
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,670
Pop some champagne.

610
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:13,931
<i>"I Followed My Heart" playing</i>

611
00:34:20,773 --> 00:34:22,606
I feel like I should
make a toast.

612
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:24,358
Again?

613
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,660
Well, we didn't drink to Cooper.

614
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:33,617
Glad he missed it.

615
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:43,177
Well, I have to go.

616
00:34:43,212 --> 00:34:45,629
Kevin can wait.
We should get dinner.

617
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:47,297
I have plans.

618
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:49,099
Come back after.

619
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:57,391
Actually, I'll drop you off.
I should call Trudy.

620
00:34:57,443 --> 00:34:59,226
She had quite a day as well.

621
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:05,699
We went down swinging.

622
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:11,205
Don't be a baby.
I'll see you tomorrow.

623
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:20,964
I'm going to get another round.

624
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,417
This is my last one.

625
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:25,135
I have a date.

626
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:30,390
You never worked at a place
this size, have you?

627
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:31,925
It's got a lot of advantages.

628
00:35:31,977 --> 00:35:33,677
You never saw
the old Sterling Cooper.

629
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:35,562
- It was mammoth.
- Not like this.

630
00:35:36,932 --> 00:35:38,599
You're happy about it.

631
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:40,984
That's okay, I understand.

632
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,686
I'm relieved.

633
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:44,655
I'm ready to let someone
else drive for a while.

634
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:50,577
I'd like to make a toast
to Lou Avery.

635
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:52,496
The Japs are going to
eat him alive.

636
00:35:59,038 --> 00:36:00,871
What a disaster.

637
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:02,673
Come on, Joan.

638
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:05,042
I need you to be the voice
of the bright side.

639
00:36:06,846 --> 00:36:10,681
Hobart listed off accounts
for everyone but me.

640
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:13,800
Put you on Ortho Pharmaceutical.

641
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:15,719
No.

642
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:18,105
And I wouldn't count
on anything he said.

643
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:23,610
I don't know.

644
00:36:23,646 --> 00:36:27,231
For the first time, I feel like
whatever happens is supposed to happen.

645
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:29,650
That's nice.

646
00:36:29,702 --> 00:36:31,618
That's what you should've said.

647
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:34,788
Well, we both know

648
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:37,407
they're never going to take
me seriously over there.

649
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:40,878
They don't know
who they're dealing with.

650
00:36:55,844 --> 00:36:57,678
I can't do any work.

651
00:36:59,815 --> 00:37:01,598
Look, I've hunted
for a job before,

652
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,818
and I may not have to,
but I appreciate the warning.

653
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:07,104
No, I keep thinking
about that woman.

654
00:37:07,106 --> 00:37:09,606
Her kid got hurt.
She felt guilty.

655
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,441
I know what she felt.

656
00:37:11,443 --> 00:37:14,661
I understand the entire
psychological situation.

657
00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:16,780
She shouldn't have talked
to me that way.

658
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:18,615
She shouldn't have kids.

659
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,584
That's not for you to say.

660
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:23,620
Ah, Jesus, I can't
even agree with you.

661
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:27,174
I don't hate kids.

662
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:32,546
Look, you got to a certain
point in your life

663
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,264
and it didn't happen.

664
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,016
I understand
you're angry about it,

665
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:38,135
but you've got
a lot of other things.

666
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:40,270
- Don't do that.
- I mean it.

667
00:37:40,306 --> 00:37:42,472
You couldn't have done
all you've done otherwise.

668
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:44,942
I guess that's the secret
to your spectacular career?

669
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:46,297
The fact that
you don't have kids?

670
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:48,061
Not that I know of.

671
00:37:48,113 --> 00:37:49,813
That's funny to you.

672
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:52,366
Because it wouldn't matter if you did.
You can walk away.

673
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,701
I would never do that.

674
00:37:54,737 --> 00:37:57,154
But you may not even know.
That's what you said.

675
00:37:57,206 --> 00:37:59,239
<i>"Stranger on the Shore" playing.</i>

676
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,959
It's been a long day.

677
00:38:01,994 --> 00:38:03,994
You're right.

678
00:38:05,214 --> 00:38:06,713
I didn't mean to judge her.

679
00:38:06,749 --> 00:38:09,499
But you did and you don't
understand it at all.

680
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:12,502
I had a mother.
And she wasn't great.

681
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:15,589
And I don't know that she wanted
me, so I understand something.

682
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:17,424
But you don't understand
your mother.

683
00:38:17,476 --> 00:38:19,009
Well, maybe I don't want to.

684
00:38:19,061 --> 00:38:21,511
Maybe she was very young.

685
00:38:21,563 --> 00:38:24,097
And followed her heart
and got in trouble.

686
00:38:24,149 --> 00:38:26,733
And no one should
have to make a mistake

687
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:30,070
just like a man does
and not be able to move on.

688
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:33,940
She should be able to live the rest
of her life just like a man does.

689
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,699
You're right.

690
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,701
I know.

691
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:51,708
Maybe you do what you
thought was the best thing.

692
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:59,349
What did you do?

693
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:10,360
I'm...

694
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,479
I'm here.

695
00:39:15,901 --> 00:39:17,901
And...

696
00:39:20,406 --> 00:39:21,905
Oh.

697
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:25,375
He's with a family somewhere.

698
00:39:32,134 --> 00:39:33,717
I don't know,

699
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:37,003
but it's not
because I don't care.

700
00:39:38,841 --> 00:39:41,808
I don't know because you're
not supposed to know.

701
00:39:43,262 --> 00:39:45,095
Or you can't go on
with your life.

702
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:55,939
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.

703
00:40:00,946 --> 00:40:02,779
Well, ahem,

704
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:04,781
you don't know lots of
things about lots of people.

705
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,833
That's the point.

706
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,039
No, it's not.

707
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:17,127
I'm fine.

708
00:40:17,179 --> 00:40:19,679
I have work to do.

709
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:32,603
You know, I made a deal with
God that if this worked out,

710
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,272
I would give up smoking.

711
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,975
Message received.

712
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:41,612
You're a young man with an
incredible future ahead of you.

713
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:47,118
No more Sterling Cooper

714
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,070
and no more Sterlings.

715
00:40:49,122 --> 00:40:52,456
Margaret is the only daughter
of an only son of an only son.

716
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:56,994
All that's left is
a mausoleum at Greenwood.

717
00:40:58,297 --> 00:41:00,414
What's in a name?

718
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:03,968
Every copywriter
thinks they're Shakespeare.

719
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,003
It's something to aspire to.

720
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,757
I always envied that.

721
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:11,342
The way you're always reaching.

722
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:13,844
I always envied
you didn't have to.

723
00:41:13,896 --> 00:41:16,764
In another lifetime,
I'd have been your chauffeur.

724
00:41:16,816 --> 00:41:19,266
Then you would've been
screwing my grandmother.

725
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,270
- Do you have somewhere to be?
- I'm afraid so.

726
00:41:23,322 --> 00:41:25,322
Tell her to join us.

727
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,274
She wouldn't like it.

728
00:41:27,326 --> 00:41:29,110
You wouldn't like it.

729
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:32,196
Now I've got to meet her.

730
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,616
You have.

731
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,119
It's Marie.

732
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,287
Marie Calvet.

733
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:44,375
You're serious?

734
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:47,845
Guess I should've
asked your permission.

735
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,214
Just warn me
before you tell Megan.

736
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:52,883
- I want to leave the country.
- She knows.

737
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,936
Then why didn't you tell me?

738
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,556
I wanted to make sure
it wasn't going away.

739
00:42:00,193 --> 00:42:01,525
She's crazy, you know?

740
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,395
When I married my secretary,

741
00:42:04,447 --> 00:42:06,363
you were hard on me.

742
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,699
And then you went
and did the same thing.

743
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:12,820
You know what?

744
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,456
For the second time today,
I surrender.

745
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,992
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

746
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:23,214
You are okay.

747
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:51,942
Can I help you?

748
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:54,778
I'm sorry. I must have
the wrong apartment.

749
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,699
Kenneth, do you know this guy?

750
00:42:58,751 --> 00:43:01,118
I've never seen him before.
I swear.

751
00:43:02,922 --> 00:43:06,040
No, I was looking for Diana Baur.
She used to live here.

752
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,542
Oh. Well, we just moved in.

753
00:43:08,594 --> 00:43:10,961
Do you know how to reach her?

754
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:14,548
She left her furniture. The
manager told us to sell it.

755
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,384
Sorry to bother you.

756
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,220
You want another drink?

757
00:43:27,947 --> 00:43:29,613
Good morning.

758
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,367
What did Caroline say?

759
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,202
They're making lists.

760
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,987
Somebody's not going.

761
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:39,873
The last thing they need
is another office manager.

762
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,709
Or another black girl.

763
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,911
I'm Roger Sterling's
second secretary.

764
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:46,080
Caroline's going to
elbow me out the window.

765
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:48,549
What are you talking about?

766
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,217
My goodness, Meredith.

767
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,219
We should put a bell on you.

768
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:57,007
Good morning.

769
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,012
What is going on?

770
00:44:02,064 --> 00:44:04,765
There are rumors flying
like bats around here.

771
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,483
What have you heard?

772
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,519
Nothing from you.

773
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:11,855
Are we going to McCann
and am I going with you?

774
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:13,490
Meredith, sweetheart...

775
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,359
Don't "sweetheart" me.

776
00:44:16,662 --> 00:44:18,696
In a month, you're not
going to have an office

777
00:44:18,748 --> 00:44:20,781
and you're not going to
have an apartment.

778
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,583
Do you want to lose me, too?

779
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,201
I was going to tell you today.

780
00:44:24,253 --> 00:44:26,287
You are coming with me
if you want to go.

781
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,840
Now, can I get
some Alka-Seltzer?

782
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,761
No.
It is not a normal day.

783
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,297
Everyone's living in a fright.

784
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:38,549
You're right.

785
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,802
Get Mr. Sterling
on the line.

786
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,060
Marsha.

787
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,283
- This is Peggy.
- It's me.

788
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,152
Where are you?

789
00:44:58,204 --> 00:44:59,820
Locked in my office.

790
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,324
Bourbon with my breakfast.

791
00:45:03,376 --> 00:45:05,376
Did you figure out
what you're going to do?

792
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,379
I'm going to McCann.

793
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,415
Really?

794
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:14,585
And you can too if you want.

795
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:16,754
You think I should?

796
00:45:16,806 --> 00:45:19,640
Everything's going to be fine.

797
00:45:23,062 --> 00:45:25,346
I'm so dumb, I believe you.

798
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:27,514
Stay on the phone, will you?

799
00:45:29,485 --> 00:45:31,101
Sure.

800
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,696
Can I have your attention,
everyone?

801
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,498
<i>Some of you
may have heard already,</i>

802
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,368
but we're proud to announce
that Sterling Cooper & Partners

803
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,787
will be moving
to McCann-Erickson.

804
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,341
Now our president,
Roger Sterling,

805
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,510
would like to say a word.

806
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,879
We know this news
may come as a surprise,

807
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,599
but McCann has assured us the transition
will be as smooth as possible.

808
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:10,557
They've already
set aside room for us.

809
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:18,031
This is good news.

810
00:46:19,452 --> 00:46:21,735
We didn't do this.

811
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,492
Hold on.

812
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:31,412
This is the beginning
of something...

813
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:34,164
not the end.

814
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:45,274
