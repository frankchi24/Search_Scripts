00:00:02,216 --> 00:00:04,546
— I have a two-year contract.
— Calm down.

3
00:00:04,753 --> 00:00:06,883
I'll find out what's going on
and I'll take care of it.

4
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:08,193
I forgive you.

5
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:09,595
And I forgive you.

6
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:11,503
Well, we're not winning.
We don't have a computer.

7
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:12,700
What?

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,657
There are some stipulations.

9
00:00:14,812 --> 00:00:17,613
Outside of client hospitality,
there will be no drinking in the office.

10
00:00:17,743 --> 00:00:19,205
You'll be in Lane's old office.

11
00:00:19,356 --> 00:00:21,506
And you will report to Lou.

12
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:25,634
Our fortunes are
in other people's hands...

13
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:29,365

Catalina, which
includes a boat ride

00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:13,747

20

or Palm Springs, which--

21
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:20,832
are you listening to me?

22
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:24,305
Don't look.
Turn around.

23
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,581
That man is staring at me.

24
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:29,449
Well, I'm relieved that you weren't
looking for a better conversation.

25
00:01:29,482 --> 00:01:32,554
It's a little rude,
but I'm fine.

26
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:35,928
— What were you saying?
— Very well.

27

28
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:41,334
George?

29
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:44,477
I didn't want to bother you.

30
00:01:44,514 --> 00:01:46,615
You're obviously
here on business.

31
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,685
What?

32
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,355
No.

33
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,196
Trudy and I are divorced--
getting divorced.

34
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:55,467
I've relocated to our
West Coast office.

35
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:58,211
George Payton, this is Bonnie,
my real estate agent.

36
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:00,749
I wish you would stop
introducing me that way.

37
00:02:00,783 --> 00:02:02,753
Why? It's good
for business.

38
00:02:02,788 --> 00:02:04,792
Okay, what if I say,

39
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:08,036
«Bonnie, my girlfriend,
<i>your</i> real estate agent»?

40
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,773
— Nice to meet you.
— Charmed.

41
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:12,545
What brings you to LA?
There's no cough-and-cold season.

42
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:14,946
— George works for Vicks.
— Oh.

43
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,548
Actually, I left.
Please, sit.

44
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm working
for Burger Chef now.

45
00:02:21,355 --> 00:02:22,824
You can't be in
the hamburger business

46
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:24,260
without taking a swing
at Disneyland.

47
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:26,427
When did that happen?

48
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,429
Right after Tom's heart attack.

49
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:30,331
I thought of you.

50
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:33,004
— Tom who?
— Tom Vogel.

51
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,343
He had a heart attack?

52
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:37,380
Who's that?

53
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:39,750
My father-in-law.

54
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,251
I hadn't heard about that.

55
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:43,755
He's fine.

56
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,391
Who knew he had a heart?

57
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,496
Yes, right.

58
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,031
You know we're putting
McCann in review.

59
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:52,266
Be nice for us to work together
without old Tom in the way.

60
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,737
Hm.

61
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,140
It would kill him.

62
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:58,074
( chuckles )

63
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:00,444
Do you want to join us?

64
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,017
How about I give you a call

65
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,152
when I get back
to the home office?

66
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,490
Of course.

67
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:11,063
Have a wonderful evening.

68
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,538
I love watching you work.

69
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,442
That was skillful.

70
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:21,346
Those conversations
happen all the time.

71
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,949
Doesn't mean anything.

Where are we supposed to work?

77
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:36,275
You all have offices.

78
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,345
Lloyd, from LeaseTech,
has informed us

79
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,082
that the footprint of the
machine was prohibitive.

80
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:43,319
<i>And then it occurred to us,</i>

81
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,957
why not let every client
who sets foot in that door

82
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:48,792
know that this agency
has entered the future?

83
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:50,725
( applause )

84
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,067
And please, we will try
and keep the construction

and installation process
as brief as possible,

You might want to wear shoes.

88
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,482
Thank you all.

items in the creative lounge,

90
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:14,123
please remove them immediately.

91

They're driving us underground.

93
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,333
You know Lou didn't
fight for our space.

94
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:23,636
He doesn't believe in creative because
he doesn't know how to do it.

95
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,605
Trust me, you're going
to use that computer

96
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,941
more than you use that lounge.

97
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:31,780
Did he hear me?

98
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:38,589
Why were you late?
You know that's a no-no.

99
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:40,189
I wasn't late.
I didn't get a memo.

100
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,489
I don't even know
what's going on.

101
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:43,323
Well, we're getting a computer.

102
00:05:43,357 --> 00:05:45,192
It's going to do
lots of magical things,

103
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:46,928
like make Harry Crane
seem important.

104
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:49,329
This decision must have been
made at the partners' level.

105
00:05:49,363 --> 00:05:52,564
It preceded you. You got a
problem, take it up with Cutler.

106
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:57,464
Think it's too early

107
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,698
to come in and celebrate our
technological advancement?

108
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,666
I think that's worse than
being late, isn't it?

109
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,868
You're right.
Good thinking.

110
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:06,269
Maybe later, off campus.

111
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:18,580
Harry Crane took a huge dump,

112
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:20,281
and we got flushed
down the toilet.

113
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:23,352
Ginsberg, don't you
believe in advertising?

114
00:06:23,386 --> 00:06:25,156
That computer
is the «Mona Lisa».

115
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,124
People pay entry
to the whole Louvre

116
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:28,793
just to walk by that thing.

117
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:33,061
This is what was unique
about this place.

118
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:35,764
I want the couch.

119
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,833
That is not going to
fit in our office.

120
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,435
Why don't we switch it with
the one in Lane's office?

121
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,004
Because that one's really good.

122
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:42,905
You mean Don's office?

123
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,075
Don! Will you take
the other end of this?

124
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:49,345
Okay.

125
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:57,956
You gotta hold your
side a little lower.

126
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,291
I'm on the heavy side of
the seesaw right now.

127
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,364
A little to your right.

128
00:07:03,398 --> 00:07:05,298
My right.

129
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,365
Damn it, Ginsberg.
Put it back.

130
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,132
It's too big for our office.

131
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,631
Come on, Stan.
I wanna try.

132
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,098
The other one's full of farts.

133
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:15,871
You're on your own.

134
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:20,844
Ginsberg:<i> Let me put this in terms
the art department can understand--</i>

135
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:23,881
they're trying to erase us!

136
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:26,853
( yells ) But they can't
erase this couch!

137
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:00,585
( sighs )

138
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:03,653
So, in addition
to the fruitful nature

139
00:08:03,687 --> 00:08:05,288
of our previous
relationship at Vicks,

140
00:08:05,323 --> 00:08:08,661
George is very excited about
our bicoastal presence.

141
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:12,734
Are we concerned about a conflict
with H Salt Fish & Chips?

142
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:15,436
Pete:<i> — Ted?</i>
— H Salt views themselves

143
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:17,706
as a specialty restaurant,
not fast food.

144
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:19,910
( chuckles )
That's a joke, right?

145
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:23,747
Pete, what did your friend
at Burger Chef say?

146
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,020
They're going to open
their thousandth store

147
00:08:26,054 --> 00:08:27,955
and that's across 45 states.

148
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:30,157
<i>George Payton knows</i>
<i>who his competition is</i>

149
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:32,792
and he loves that we
understand the franchise game.

150
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:35,224
Well, Ted, you're the
king of fish and chips,

151
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:37,158
but I don't want you running
the team from out there.

152
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:39,495
We're calling you home.

153
00:08:40,863 --> 00:08:42,962
Sorry, Jim,
I'm not going anywhere.

154
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:44,899
I think we should
put Peggy on it.

155
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:47,102
This is a national campaign.

156
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:48,903
It's almost three million
in billings.

157
00:08:48,937 --> 00:08:50,669
The whole thing's
about the kitchen

158
00:08:50,703 --> 00:08:52,601
and the cleanliness and
getting to the homemakers.

159
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:54,436
They'll want a woman.

160
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,742
Lou?

161
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:00,607
I think Peggy
is the right choice.

162
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,374
Well, I'm glad all agree the
client is going to love

163
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,808
having a woman's
point of view--

164
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,744
or whatever
Peggy counts as--

165
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:11,111
but is Don not even
on the list?

166
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:12,945
I was thinking the same thing.

167
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:15,180
He's spent three weeks
alone in that cave,

168
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:16,679
and he hasn't clubbed
another ape yet.

169
00:09:16,713 --> 00:09:19,348
High praise indeed.
Lou?

170
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:23,518
Don's a very valuable
piece of talent.

171
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,019
He should be put
to work already.

172
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,222
Absolutely.

173
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:29,993
Roger: — <i>Good work all around.</i>

174
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,294
That's what I always say,

175
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:33,095
this business
is about relationships.

176
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,430
Bye-bye, boys.

177
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:37,234
Ted: — Dee, we're done.

178
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:39,804
Let's see them give<i> that</i>
to Bob Benson.

179
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,309
We done here?

180
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:49,151
I thought we had an
understanding about Don.

181
00:09:49,186 --> 00:09:51,253
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

182
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:54,454
He's an exquisite copywriter,
if nothing else.

183
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:56,092
He's gonna implode.

184
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:58,530
That's a distinct
possibility, isn't it?

185
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,531
On the other hand, you
might get some good work.

186
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:08,338
( squealing )

187
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,844
Hey, spud.
Get over here.

188
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:19,050
— What's going on?
— We're playing «hide-and-go-seek».

189
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,754
You hear that, Caroline?
Someone's hunting big game.

190
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,956
And someone's looking for<i> you.</i>

191
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:27,260
— Is Mommy here?
— No, Daddy and Nana.

192
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,430
They're in there.
Ellery and I are supposed to «go play».

193
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:32,633
See ya later, alligator.

194
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,203
( rattles )

195
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,177
Mona, Brooks.

196
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:44,081
What a pleasant surprise.

197
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:47,318
Mona: — Margaret's run away.
— To where? Bergdorf's?

198
00:10:47,352 --> 00:10:49,455
It's not a joke.
She's upstate

199
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,122
with some sort of
religious cult.

200
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:53,222
— What?
— It's a commune.

201
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:55,658
Mona: — You don't know that.
— What the hell happened?

202
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:57,193
I can't get a straight story.

203
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:58,927
Because I don't know
why you need to know.

204
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,793
Apparently, she
woke up one morning

205
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,660
and got in a van with some
hippies that she barely knew.

206
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,196
She's only been gone
a few days.

207
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,998
10. Brooks and I
think it best

208
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,432
if you go up there
and retrieve her.

209
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,103
The only reason I even told you

210
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,808
is because I need someone
to watch my son,

211
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:15,208
and I thought it best
it be family.

212
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:17,941
If you don't want to do it, I've got
a long list of strangers I can pay.

213
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,873
You're upset.

214
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:22,844
You're not thinking right.

215
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:25,677
We can't help you if you
don't tell us what happened.

216
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,982
Look, she hasn't
been herself lately

217
00:11:33,016 --> 00:11:36,485
and we went to this
marriage encounter group.

218
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,287
( chuckles )
You're kidding.

219
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:39,989
She wanted to, and I thought

220
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,758
it would be good for her
to talk to people.

221
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,192
That's always a mistake.

222
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:45,828
Roger!

223
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,332
Brooks, sweetheart,

224
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:50,532
I don't mind watching
my grandson,

225
00:11:50,566 --> 00:11:52,100
but it sounds like
you tried to stop her

226
00:11:52,134 --> 00:11:54,104
and you obviously failed.

227
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:57,210
— A father is a powerful thing.
— What are you doing?

228
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:59,378
Of course, she'll watch him.
Let the man be a man.

229
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,348
I appreciate that, sir.
I'm gonna go say goodbye.

230
00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:06,348
I'm telling him that I'm
joining her on vacation.

231
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,685
Good idea.

232
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:15,456
— <i> ( door closes )</i>
— What kind of a sales pitch was that?

233
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,557
— That was terrible.
— I agree with him.

234
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,962
She is off her rocker

235
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:21,599
and she has run away with,

236
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:23,867
from what I can glean,
more than one lover.

237
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:26,636
I only know one other person who
would do something like that.

238
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,305
How is this my fault?

239
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,440
Because she is a perverse child
who only thinks of herself.

240
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:33,009
Look, I know you're upset.

241
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,446
I am terribly worried.

242
00:12:36,415 --> 00:12:39,184
It'll be fine.

243
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:45,588
<i>( door closes )</i>

244
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:48,561
( whirring )

245
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,527
Harry: — <i>Well, it was
a variety show,</i>

246
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,863
and it featured this computer

247
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,533
that was programming
the variety acts.

248
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:55,504
And they had a lot of
psychedelic graphics.

249
00:12:55,538 --> 00:12:57,040
It was obvious that
whoever did the sets

250
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:59,242
had never seen the
IBM 360, I can say.

251
00:12:59,276 --> 00:13:01,744
Lloyd: — <i>Maybe I'll go buy a TV.
I can catch it.</i>

252
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:04,647
You should get a TV, but it got
cancelled 11 minutes into the premiere.

253
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:07,652
Tim Conway plays a guy who's trying
to kill himself the whole show.

254
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,320
Probably to get out
of his contract.

255
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:11,088
Don Draper, this is
Lloyd Hawley.

256
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,689
— Lloyd's with LeaseTech.
— I saw you at the announcement.

257
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:14,491
And what do you do
around here, Don?

258
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:16,861
Oh. Don is,
uh, a partner

259
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:18,397
and our creative director.

260
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,801
I thought Lou was
the creative director.

261
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:22,801
— We have two.
— We have three.

262
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,501
I mean, there's Ted, too.

263
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:28,036
You must have a hell of
a business right now.

264
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:30,039
We'll see.
It's tough,

265
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:33,003
because we both sell IBM's
product and compete with them.

266
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:36,638
Who's winning? Who's
replacing more humans?

267
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,141
Listen, I apologize
about your work area.

268
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:42,307
It wasn't my idea.

269
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:44,740
Look, I'm sorry
you lost your lunchroom.

270
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:47,110
— It's not symbolic.
— No, it's quite literal.

271
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,712
I'll talk to you later, Lloyd.

272
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,512
Some of us have work to do.

273
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:55,317
This is why I supervise
the installations.

274
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,786
There's always
some kind of trouble.

275
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,586
Don't worry,
that goes back years.

276
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,386
Well, I go into
businesses every day,

277
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:02,754
and it's been my experience

278
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:04,257
these machines
can be a metaphor

279
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,893
for whatever's
on people's minds.

280
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:07,360
Because they're
afraid of computers?

281
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:10,263
Yes. This machine
is frightening to people,

282
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:11,965
but it's made by people.

283
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,433
And people aren't frightening?

284
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:15,537
It's not that.

285
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:18,307
It's more of
a cosmic disturbance.

286
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:20,176
This machine is intimidating

287
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:22,913
because it contains infinite
quantities of information,

288
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,215
and that's threatening,

289
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:27,185
because human existence
is finite.

290
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:29,020
But isn't it godlike

291
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:31,390
that we've mastered
the infinite?

292
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:34,224
The IBM 360 can count
more stars in a day

293
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,424
than we can in a lifetime.

294
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,892
But what man laid on his back

295
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:40,062
counting stars and
thought about a number?

296
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,163
He probably thought about
going to the moon.

297
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:48,265
Pleasure to meet you, Lloyd.
I should get back in there.

298
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,572
— You wanted to see me?
— Close the door.

299
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,174
<i>( hammering fades )</i>

300
00:15:09,446 --> 00:15:12,449
<i>( faint drill whirring )</i>

301
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:14,220
It's quite a view, isn't it?

302
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:16,989
I like to think of myself
as a leader, Peggy,

303
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:18,722
and that means
doling out discipline.

304
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:21,089
But it also means tempering it

305
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:23,759
with encouragement.

306
00:15:23,793 --> 00:15:27,095
Which should I be prepared for?

307
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,965
I didn't hire you,
but I would have,

308
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:31,871
and I would've paid you
as befits your senior status.

309
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:38,109
I'm giving you
$100 more a week.

310
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:42,017
I'm writing it
on this piece of paper

311
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:45,451
because I've found that
saying things around here...

312
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,390
is useless.

313
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,595
Well, I...

314
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,232
appreciate that.
Very much.

315
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:00,034
Well, with it comes a mission.

316
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:01,736
I'm putting you
in charge of Burger Chef.

317
00:16:01,771 --> 00:16:03,803
Really?

318
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,303
Carve out hours for whomever
you want on the team.

319
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:08,573
And Don.

320
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:11,511
— Don Draper?
— He's the one.

321
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:19,517
Thank you so much, Lou.

322
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,922
Knock 'em dead.

323
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:23,323
Have you told Don?

324
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,658
You're in charge, sweetheart.

<i>( hammers banging )</i>

327
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:48,376
— Is he in?
— He never leaves.

328
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:06,463
Marsha, can you bring Don
and Mathis to my office?

329
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:08,962
<i>Certainly.</i>

330
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,865
— <i> ( knocking on door )</i>
— Come in.

331
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:16,369
Please don't eat that.
You're so trim.

332
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:21,374
— Anything else?
— Miss Olson would like to see you.

333
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:25,278
— Send her in.
— No, I'm to send<i> you</i> in.

334
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,816
Okay.

335
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:42,300
— You wanted to see me?
— Can I offer you something?

336
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:44,737
It was a long walk, but no.

337
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,006
I have what I think
is very good news.

338
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,808
I hope you'll see it that way.

339
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:51,277
Hey, Don.

340
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:05,457
I don't know if you've
heard the rumors,

341
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:08,960
but Pete Campbell has gotten us a
presentation with Burger Chef.

342
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:11,262
All I know is it's
national fast food.

343
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,630
— They run a new spot every month.
— That's right.

344
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:15,632
But we have to win it first,

345
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:17,401
and that's why I wanted
you both on my team.

346
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:19,671
Congratulations.

347
00:18:19,705 --> 00:18:22,172
Congratulations to you.

348
00:18:22,206 --> 00:18:24,139
Mathis: — <i>How long do we have?</i>

349
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:27,406
I don't know yet, but I want
to get started right away.

350
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,310
I think 25 tags
should get the ball rolling.

351
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:32,346
— I'll get right on it.
— Apiece.

352
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,382
That's 50 total
between the two of you.

353
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:43,597
— What's the strategy?
— Lou likes to start with the tags

354
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:45,766
and then sneak up
on a strategy.

355
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,502
You'll get used to it.

356
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:52,606
Well, that'll do it.

357
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:59,246
— Thanks for thinking of me.
— I look forward to your work.

358
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,249
Monday.

<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

363
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:46,529
— How was your weekend?
Don: — Lonely.

364
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:48,898
— How was yours?
— Wouldn't you like to know?

365
00:19:50,698 --> 00:19:54,170
Oh, I'm sorry. You have a
meeting with Miss Olson,

366
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:57,472
and the Burger Chef
research came in.

367
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:09,487
— Is he in?
— Yes.

368
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,624
Good.

369
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:26,230
Oh, good.

370
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:27,564
Don't act like you
were looking for me.

371
00:20:27,598 --> 00:20:29,097
I was looking for you.

372
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:31,167
I need coffee.
I didn't sleep last night.

373
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:32,868
Well, Mona called,

374
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:35,871
and I'm supposed
to read you this message.

375
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:39,406
«Hey, genius!
Brooks is in jail in Kingston».

376
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,874
From now on, you don't listen
to her, you listen to me.

377
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:54,144
And what I really like
is no matter what you order,

378
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,612
they give you
a side of spaghetti,

379
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,312
even if you order spaghetti.

380
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:58,681
What, Burger Chef does?

381
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,618
No, Vito's.

382
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:04,388
I can go get him.

383
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,073
Don: — <i>Come in.</i>

384
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:20,114
It's time for the meeting.

385
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,216
I can't make it.

386
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,518
Oh.

387
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:25,920
Do you want me
to turn in your tags?

388
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:27,254
Nope.

389
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:28,822
Okay.

390
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,893
He's not coming.

391
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,664
— What?
— That's what he said.

392
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:41,069
Is that right?

393
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:43,904
I guess he's not ready.

394
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:45,404
I mean, we did
just get the research.

395
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,752
I would really appreciate a chance
to beef these up, as it were.

396
00:21:52,786 --> 00:21:55,221
I mean, if Don's
going to get more time.

397
00:21:57,725 --> 00:21:59,560
Here's a better idea.

398
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:01,929
Why don't we move the meeting
to the end of the day,

399
00:22:01,963 --> 00:22:04,867
and you give me what you've
got now plus 25 more?

400
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:07,399
That's going to be 50.

401
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:09,198
But now you have the research.

402
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:24,948
<i>( bangs glove box )</i>

403
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:27,786
— Hey.
— Nothing works.

404
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,788
You need to calm down.
I don't want this

405
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:31,789
turning into «The Guiding
Light» the moment we get there.

406
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:34,492
Ha. I'm worried,
but you're angry.

407
00:22:34,526 --> 00:22:36,427
Don't lose your temper.

408
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:37,862
How much cash do you have?

409
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:39,729
Why don't you reach in
and check?

410
00:22:40,831 --> 00:22:42,428
His bail is 180.

411
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,462
Let Brooks spend another day
in the slammer.

412
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:46,797
— He'll just get in the way.
— No, obviously.

413
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,033
I meant we should spring
him on the way back.

414
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,707
He's a bum. If he wasn't a bum,
she wouldn't have left him.

415
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:54,209
She told him she was
never leaving that place

416
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:55,711
and that he and Ellery
could stay there.

417
00:22:55,746 --> 00:22:57,612
And what was he supposed to do?

418
00:22:57,646 --> 00:22:59,278
He was supposed to get into
a fight with those hippies,

419
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:01,748
not some rednecks in a
bar three hours later.

420
00:23:01,783 --> 00:23:04,218
It's my fault.

421
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:06,021
I always let her
out of everything.

422
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:08,825
She only had one job and
that was to find a husband,

423
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:11,796
— and she mucked it up.
— You liked him.

424
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:15,566
I thought he was good
enough for the time being.

425
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,101
( sighs )

426
00:23:17,135 --> 00:23:19,170
I wanted her to wait
like I did.

427
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:22,639
You only waited
because<i> I</i> wasn't available.

428
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:24,842
Well, look how that worked out.

429
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:27,245
What was she supposed to think?

430
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,880
«Things are hard, I'll
just find another man».

431
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,949
That can't be it.

432
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:34,789
Oh, God, I hope she's
not a drug addict--

433
00:23:34,824 --> 00:23:37,692
although they usually
stay in the city.

434
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:41,096
— How do you know that?
— «Life» magazine.

435
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:44,500
It's probably another man,
who probably has drugs.

436
00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:46,999
You and me is not
such a bad example.

437
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:49,002
I mean, what psychiatrist is
Ellery going to be telling one day

438
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,971
about the weekend
his dad was in jail

439
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:52,771
and his mom was in a commune?

440
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,138
I'm sure you can recommend one.

441
00:23:57,507 --> 00:23:58,975
You know, I haven't
seen her in a while,

442
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:00,342
because the last time I did,

443
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:03,644
she was so cruel and so serene.

444
00:24:03,678 --> 00:24:06,381
She<i> has</i> been strange lately.

445
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,449
And a little bit philosophical?

446
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:12,621
Yes.

447
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,857
( chuckles )

448
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:17,725
I thought she was
finally happy.

449
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:26,132
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

450
00:24:29,998 --> 00:24:32,231
Come in.

451
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:34,632
Sorry to bother you.

452
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:37,069
Do you have a light?
Mine crapped out on me.

453
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:39,006
The perils of technology.

454
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,174
It's 1969 and you're
unable to make fire.

455
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,243
Human error.
Forgot to fill it.

456
00:24:46,247 --> 00:24:48,215
You're the only one here.
It's lunchtime.

457
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:51,784
— I'm not hungry.
— Probably have too much to do.

458
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:53,953
I'm not doing anything.

459
00:24:53,987 --> 00:24:56,657
Look, I don't want
to put you out,

460
00:24:56,691 --> 00:24:57,691
but if you have
a second--

461
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:00,829
I have an advertising question.

462
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,436
Go ahead.

463
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,806
Advertising--
does it work?

464
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,107
On some people.

465
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:14,577
It helps to have
a good product.

466
00:25:14,611 --> 00:25:16,245
I'll tell you how great it is.

467
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,415
I started LeaseTech
with two old friends,

468
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,887
and six months later,
we have 19 new employees

469
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,155
and three new competitors.

470
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,724
Well, the first question

471
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,294
is how is what
you're selling unique?

472
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,896
IBM's leases
are short and expensive

473
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,763
because they're always
replacing the equipment

474
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,330
with the newest model.

475
00:25:35,365 --> 00:25:37,132
Ours are cheaper
because we don't do that.

476
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,134
Don't yours become obsolete?

477
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:41,503
They all become
obsolete eventually.

478
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:44,173
The question is,
how long does that take?

479
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:47,345
IBM doesn't care because
they just sell new machines.

480
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:50,880
At this point, I usually ask,

481
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:52,918
«How did you get
into this business?»

482
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:56,054
Well, I was at IBM
for a few years.

483
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,988
— I knew it.
— Yes.

484
00:25:58,022 --> 00:26:00,325
And I saw that they
have got a great product,

485
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,295
but they don't trust it.

486
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,362
I've worked
with these machines.

487
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:05,997
I know how resilient they are.

488
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,669
I don't want to find them
in a junkyard in two years.

489
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,940
So you're betting that
they'll last longer

490
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:14,075
— than even IBM thinks?
— Yeah.

491
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:17,346
But the problem is, so are a
bunch of other companies.

492
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:19,649
But they don't have you,

493
00:26:19,684 --> 00:26:21,585
and they don't advertise.

494
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:26,055
Very nice.

495
00:26:27,557 --> 00:26:29,424
What's IBM like?

496
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,861
Oh, there you are. I thought
we were going to lunch.

497
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:36,696
Thanks for the light.
Pleasure to talk to you.

498
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,166
You were going to give me the
name of a good keypunch service.

499
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,203
<i>( door closes )</i>

500
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,404
— When's Roger back from lunch?
— He's gone for the day.

501
00:26:58,013 --> 00:26:59,449
— ( knocks )
— You got a second, Bert?

502
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:01,516
Of course.

503
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:04,320
LeaseTech--

504
00:27:04,354 --> 00:27:06,226
the company that we're leasing
the computer from — is a virgin.

505
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,961
And I think we should
prepare a presentation

506
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:10,428
while their guy is hanging around.
Push him over the edge.

507
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,597
New business?

508
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,367
That whole industry
is exploding.

509
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:17,136
This guy has
exponential growth.

510
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,139
Have you forgotten
the stipulations?

511
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:20,941
Fine, tell somebody else.

512
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:22,543
I mean, the apple
is right there.

513
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:25,047
You have a fundamental
misunderstanding

514
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:27,484
of what went wrong here.

515
00:27:27,518 --> 00:27:29,152
So, that's it? You want
me to be a janitor?

516
00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:31,120
Whistle while I work?

517
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:33,056
You thought
there was going to be

518
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,995
a big creative crisis and
we'd pull you off the bench,

519
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,498
but in fact, we've
been doing just fine.

520
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,301
So, why am I even here?
I could've gone anywhere.

521
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:45,205
— Why<i> are</i> you here?
— Because I started this agency!

522
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,210
Along with a dead man--
whose office you now inhabit.

523
00:28:02,393 --> 00:28:04,961
I left something in there.

524
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,663
When?

525
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:20,943
Thank you, Caroline.
I got it.

526
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:43,342
( trickling )

527
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:55,491
What are you doing?

528
00:29:16,415 --> 00:29:18,015
Are you looking
to buy some jelly?

529
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:19,516
The stand's up the road.

530
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,019
No, we're looking
for Margaret Sterling.

531
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,090
Hargrove.
Margaret Hargrove.

532
00:29:24,125 --> 00:29:27,530
I know who
you're talking about.

533
00:29:27,564 --> 00:29:30,100
Marigold?

534
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:33,472
She doesn't want any trouble,
and we don't want any trouble.

535
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:35,442
Nor do we.

536
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:37,276
These two are looking for you.

537
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:39,178
You know 'em?

538
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:42,015
Of course I do.

539
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:45,050
This is my mother and father.

540
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,125
— Mother, you look wonderful.
— Stop it.

541
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,594
I know why you're here,

542
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:54,498
and I just want to welcome you.

543
00:29:59,973 --> 00:30:02,674
Margaret, darling,
we just--

544
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:06,244
Could you call off your dogs?

545
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:08,180
I'd like to have
a private conversation.

546
00:30:08,214 --> 00:30:10,983
Hey, everybody, I understand
the dry cleaning's ready,

547
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,352
but can you bring it
back in an hour?

548
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:14,121
There's 50 bucks in it for you.

549
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:17,423
I'm fine, everyone.
These are my parents.

550
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:28,309
Will you let me show
you around at least,

551
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:31,681
before you start railing against
something you don't understand?

552
00:30:31,715 --> 00:30:34,052
I don't know what happened
between you and Brooks,

553
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:35,888
but your son misses you.

554
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:39,190
Things have never been better
between me and Brooks.

555
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:41,123
Ever.

556
00:30:41,158 --> 00:30:43,459
And...

557
00:30:43,494 --> 00:30:46,096
I miss Ellery so much.

558
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,931
I think about him all the time,

559
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:51,872
but he can't be happy
if I'm not happy.

560
00:30:51,906 --> 00:30:53,806
I didn't know how dire it was,

561
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,606
but if you need money, whatever
you want, whatever you need.

562
00:30:56,641 --> 00:31:00,344
She doesn't want money.
Margaret, listen.

563
00:31:00,378 --> 00:31:04,947
Sugarplum, these people
are lost and on drugs,

564
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:06,749
and they have
venereal diseases.

565
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,286
That's not for you.

566
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,488
You don't know them.

567
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:12,456
And I'm tired of accepting

568
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:15,660
society's definition of me.

569
00:31:15,694 --> 00:31:17,861
I don't pray to that anymore.

570
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:21,329
Darling, I understand.

571
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:23,464
Being a young mother
can be overwhelming,

572
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:25,132
even with help.

573
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:27,401
You sit with your child
at the end of the day

574
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:29,536
and you're exhausted

575
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:31,672
and you don't even know
what you did.

576
00:31:31,706 --> 00:31:34,107
And everything you do
seems wrong.

577
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,441
It's hard to accept that
those are the definitions,

578
00:31:36,476 --> 00:31:38,077
but they are.

579
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:40,115
I'm sorry you had
nothing to live for.

580
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:43,885
I did. I had you,
and I was grateful.

581
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,186
I'm grateful.

582
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,923
I don't have to lock
myself in a bathroom

583
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:49,893
with a pint of gin every day.

584
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:51,628
I ought to slap you.

585
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:53,163
Why are you talking
to your mother like that?

586
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:56,968
Daddy, I'm–I'm sorry.

587
00:31:57,003 --> 00:31:58,603
I'm telling her the truth,

588
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:00,471
and she doesn't
want to hear it.

589
00:32:00,505 --> 00:32:02,605
Let's go!

590
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,650
You didn't even
let me talk to her.

591
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:10,518
There's no more point
in talking.

592
00:32:10,552 --> 00:32:12,752
I'd think she was brainwashed,
but there's nothing to wash.

593
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:15,390
You can't make her turn on a dime.
You'll embarrass her.

594
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:18,295
Fine. You want to wine and
dine the account, Roger?

595
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:19,995
Knock yourself out.

596
00:32:20,029 --> 00:32:21,695
There's a four-year-old
in Manhattan

597
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,029
crying himself to sleep.

598
00:32:24,795 --> 00:32:26,930
I'll get «Cletus»
to drive me to the train.

599
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:36,703
( door slams, engine starts )

600
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:45,145
Marigold!

601
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:47,146
You want to show me around?

602
00:32:50,173 --> 00:32:52,506
( sighs )

603
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:56,179
<i>( hammering )</i>

604
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:58,650
<i>( saw whirring )</i>

605
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:23,115
Hey, it's Don.

606
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:25,117
Look at that, I got you.

607
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:26,718
I didn't know where you'd be.

608
00:33:26,752 --> 00:33:28,753
You're here, there, everywhere.

609
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,959
No, I'm not in the bag.
I'm in the office.

610
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:36,762
Listen, let's go to Shea.

611
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:40,931
Let's go see a game, I mean it.

612
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:42,900
Is there a game today?

613
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,236
You shouldn't have
told me that,

614
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,140
because now we're really going.

615
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:50,342
Okay. Your wish is my command.
I will not move.

616
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:53,880
Can I hang up the phone?

617
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:56,016
( chuckles )

618
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:06,559
( groans )

619
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:12,265
When you're done with that,

620
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:14,833
one of us should
find some firewood.

621
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:16,633
When he's done with that,
he's not going to be able

622
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:19,170
to find his ass
with both hands.

623
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:20,840
I'll tell you what, Clay,

624
00:34:20,874 --> 00:34:22,376
why don't we switch jobs?

625
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:25,012
You want to get firewood,
help yourself.

626
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:26,612
There's no hierarchy, man.

627
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,081
Believe me, there's
always a hierarchy.

628
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:31,919
We do things
by true consensus here.

629
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:33,719
If we can't all agree
on something,

630
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:35,519
we think of something else.

631
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:39,025
Everyone does what they want.

632
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:40,827
Good.

633
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:42,128
Because I haven't felt
this at one with nature

634
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:43,663
since I was in the Navy.

635
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,739
Go ahead, it's dynamite grass.

636
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:55,073
Now, I see why
we're eating so early.

637
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:57,408
No, it's because

638
00:34:57,442 --> 00:34:59,209
we follow the cycles
of the Earth.

639
00:34:59,243 --> 00:35:00,876
It's gonna get dark.

640
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,508
Electricity and all that?

641
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:07,280
It just brings problems.

642
00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:09,182
But you've got a truck.

643
00:35:09,216 --> 00:35:12,149
Yeah.

644
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:14,451
That's been up for debate, man.

645
00:35:14,486 --> 00:35:17,557
Doesn't it get cold up here?

646
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:19,561
Margaret: — We light a campfire.

647
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:26,500
And there's other ways
to keep warm.

648
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:34,071
It's all right, sweetheart.
He's expecting me.

649
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:39,577
Freddy, what
a pleasant surprise.

650
00:35:39,611 --> 00:35:43,451
— You know you called me.
— I sure do.

651
00:35:43,486 --> 00:35:45,718
— There's someone I want you to meet.
— Who?

652
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:48,755
I want you to...
♪ meet the Mets ♪

653
00:35:48,789 --> 00:35:52,429
Meet the Mets!
♪ Step right up and greet the Mets. ♪

654
00:35:52,463 --> 00:35:54,963
Great idea.
Can you walk?

655
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:04,607
Hello again.

656
00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:06,842
Meredith, we're off
for the day.

657
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:10,478
— Way off.
— Okay. You two have fun.

658
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,949
<i>( saw buzzing )</i>

659
00:36:16,388 --> 00:36:18,322
Where are you going?

660
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:20,991
<i>( hammer rapping )</i>

661
00:36:23,831 --> 00:36:26,263
Don, I didn't hear you.

662
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:28,063
No, I didn't hear you.

663
00:36:28,097 --> 00:36:30,666
Come on, Don, we're
gonna miss the game.

664
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:37,608
You talk like a friend,
but you're not.

665
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:40,944
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

666
00:36:40,978 --> 00:36:43,544
I know your name.

667
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:45,246
It's Lloyd.
I told you.

668
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,447
No, you go by many names.

669
00:36:47,482 --> 00:36:50,450
I know who you are.

670
00:36:50,484 --> 00:36:52,219
Don, let's go.

671
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,721
Why don't you listen
to your friend?

672
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:55,922
You don't need a campaign.

673
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:58,123
You've had the best campaign
since the dawn of time.

674
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:02,492
Pull yourself together.

675
00:37:07,563 --> 00:37:10,132
Freddy?

676
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:11,968
We're knocking off early.

677
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:14,737
— Okay.
— Ball game.

678
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,148
I just wanted to make sure you
saw the memo from the partners.

679
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:23,319
Your raise was approved.
Congratulations.

680
00:37:23,353 --> 00:37:25,121
What?

681
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:29,995
Oh, yes — thank you.
This office is so great.

682
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:32,000
Everyone can just drop by
on their way out.

683
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:34,436
Don't worry,
it won't happen again.

684
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:36,939
Joan!

685
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:41,774
I'm sorry.
I'm just having a day.

686
00:37:41,808 --> 00:37:44,476
I have exactly two minutes.

687
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:46,481
It won't take that long.

688
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,784
You already know the problem.

689
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:50,818
Burger Chef's a big account,

690
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,785
but they obviously thought
you were ready for it.

691
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:54,751
They didn't want to give me
Burger Chef.

692
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:56,486
They wanted to give me Don.

693
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:58,156
What are you talking about?

694
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,925
You didn't hear?

695
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:01,927
Lou put Don on my team.

696
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:04,163
To cowardice.

697
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:05,865
Mine or theirs?

698
00:38:09,973 --> 00:38:14,144
He owes me work, and he's
going to the ball game?

699
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:17,848
And there's nothing I can
do, and he knows that.

700
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:20,815
Have you told Lou?
You don't know this,

701
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,688
but there were rules
set for Don.

702
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:27,390
— Is he breaking them?
— I don't know.

703
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:30,863
( sighs )

704
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:34,002
So, they just
dropped it in my lap,

705
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:36,334
hoping one of us would fail.

706
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:42,546
Well, Peggy, I don't know if
this makes you feel better,

707
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:45,015
but I don't think they
thought about it at all.

708
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:51,255
Roger: — I can't believe my
little «princess and the pea»

709
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,692
is sleeping like this.

710
00:38:53,727 --> 00:38:56,164
You never even wanted
to go camping.

711
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:58,066
Margaret: — Well...

712
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,743
I used to think
the country was lonely.

713
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:05,779
Now I realize the city is.

714
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:08,647
I mean, look at that.

715
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:15,090
It's beautiful.

716
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:17,255
You think we'll put
a man up there?

717
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,627
With all the brainpower
around here?

718
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:23,099
I'm certain you'll put
a man on the roof.

719
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:28,267
I'd like to go to the moon.

720
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:31,440
Well, I guess if you can make
an allowance for a truck,

721
00:39:31,474 --> 00:39:33,808
you can make an allowance
for a rocket.

722
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:35,778
Don't you want to go?

723
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:37,647
Of course.

724
00:39:37,682 --> 00:39:39,882
Every little boy
wants to be an astronaut.

725
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:42,951
Astronauts didn't exist
when you were a little boy.

726
00:39:42,986 --> 00:39:45,457
Jules Verne--

727
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:47,623
«From the Earth
to the Moon».

728
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:50,791
You read that to me.

729
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:53,262
They shot a cannon into space.

730
00:39:53,296 --> 00:39:56,433
I don't think so.

731
00:39:56,468 --> 00:39:58,267
Must've been your mother.

732
00:40:08,848 --> 00:40:11,218
I'm really happy here, Daddy.

733
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:17,656
I know.

734
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:38,346
Oop, oop...

735
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,282
Get my binoculars.
They're in the hallway closet.

736
00:40:40,316 --> 00:40:42,184
Good idea.

737
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:46,218
We're going to miss
the national anthem.

738
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,694
<i>( door closes )</i>

739
00:40:58,728 --> 00:41:01,598

<i>Stop it, not here.</i>

740
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:19,008

741
00:41:21,484 --> 00:41:23,718
<i>( car horn honks )</i>

742
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:28,522
Come on.

743
00:41:28,557 --> 00:41:31,025
It's as black and strong
as Jack Johnson.

744
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:38,498
Thank you.

745
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,534
How'd you get in?

746
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:45,037
I'm glad you passed out.
I got a lot less to explain.

747
00:41:46,973 --> 00:41:49,541
Did the Mets win?

748
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,512
What the hell are you doing?

749
00:41:54,547 --> 00:41:56,147
Aren't they giving you
a second chance?

750
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:58,383
They weren't serious about it.

751
00:41:58,417 --> 00:42:00,651
They finally gave me
something to do,

752
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:04,021
and it was write
25 tags for Peggy.

753
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:07,391
— What's the account?
— Burger Chef.

754
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:10,160
Hm — Peggy.

755
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,195
Have you been
to the restaurant yet?

756
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,998
What, and have some pimply kid

757
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,200
who should be writing taglines
hand me a milk shake?

758
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,467
How would you rather have it?

759
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,202
Would you rather be
in my situation--

760
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,704
bouncing from office to office?

761
00:42:21,738 --> 00:42:24,006
«Ding-dong,
Don Draper calling».

762
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,540
I want my job back.

763
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:27,042
How the hell do you think
that's going to happen

764
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:29,477
when you're at
the bottom of a bottle?

765
00:42:29,512 --> 00:42:31,379
You know you never have to
have another drink again.

766
00:42:31,413 --> 00:42:33,314
I don't want to hear
that right now.

767
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:35,416
You're hungover. It's the
best time to hear it.

768
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,420
I mean, are you
just going to kill yourself?

769
00:42:39,454 --> 00:42:41,755
Give them what they want?

770
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:44,691
Or go in your bedroom,
get in uniform,

771
00:42:44,726 --> 00:42:48,061
fix your bayonet,
and hit the parade?

772
00:42:49,096 --> 00:42:50,930
Do the work, Don.

773
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,908
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

774
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:11,283
You're up early.

775
00:43:11,317 --> 00:43:12,951
Where's my daughter?

776
00:43:12,985 --> 00:43:15,854
She's probably at the
creek getting water.

777
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:17,156
I don't think so.

778
00:43:18,759 --> 00:43:21,764
It's a beautiful night
and a beautiful morning.

779
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,234
Did you see the sunrise?

780
00:43:29,341 --> 00:43:31,576
It's a beautiful
morning, isn't it?

781
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,278
It's time to leave
Shangri-La, baby.

782
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:35,781
Take a good look, say
goodbye to your friends.

783
00:43:35,815 --> 00:43:37,783
You were doing so well, Daddy.

784
00:43:37,817 --> 00:43:39,552
Fine, you don't want to say goodbye?
Let's go.

785
00:43:39,586 --> 00:43:42,255
Hey, man, leave her be.

786
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:44,791
Come on, Sprout, feel like
driving the truck today?

787
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:47,861
No one's going to help you
take me away from here.

788
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,030
They know this is
where I want to be.

789
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:51,598
I don't care what you want, and
I don't care what they want.

790
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:53,533
It's over.
Let's go.

791
00:43:53,568 --> 00:43:56,070
I don't know why I assumed
you were more open-minded.

792
00:43:56,104 --> 00:43:58,973
Well, I'm not. I
understand the temptation,

793
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:00,941
and I know everyone your
age is running away

794
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:03,611
and screwing around, but you can't.
You're a mother.

795
00:44:03,645 --> 00:44:06,948
— Ellery has everything he needs.
— He needs his mother.

796
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:09,251
I'm sorry, but you
don't get to do this!

797
00:44:09,284 --> 00:44:11,352
Goodbye, Daddy.

798
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:16,858
Let me go!
Let me go right now!

799
00:44:21,797 --> 00:44:24,032
( grunts )

800
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:31,406
How could you just leave him?

801
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:33,075
He's your baby.

802
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:35,177
How did you feel

803
00:44:35,211 --> 00:44:37,479
when you went away
to work, Daddy?

804
00:44:37,513 --> 00:44:40,849
Your conscience must
have been eating you alive.

805
00:44:40,884 --> 00:44:43,252
Calling your secretary
from a hotel

806
00:44:43,286 --> 00:44:45,754
to pick out a birthday
present for me?

807
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:48,991
I'm sure you were<i> sick.</i>

808
00:44:49,025 --> 00:44:51,827
It's not that hard, Daddy.

809
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:54,396
He'll be fine.

810
00:45:20,824 --> 00:45:22,825
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

811
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:39,242
You sure you don't
want a Danish?

812
00:45:39,276 --> 00:45:41,377
Nope.

813
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:48,518
— Coffee?
— Yes, please.

814
00:46:03,033 --> 00:46:04,300
Good morning.

815
00:46:05,602 --> 00:46:07,603
I'll have your tags by lunch.

816
00:46:08,606 --> 00:46:10,774
Great.

817
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:14,243
