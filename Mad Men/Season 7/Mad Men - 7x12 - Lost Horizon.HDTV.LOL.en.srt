2
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:45,252
Good morning,
Mr. Draper.

3
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:47,088
Morning.

4
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:49,256
It's Beverly, isn't it?

5
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,058
He's on 19.

6
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,194
Thank you.

7
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,631
Good morning.

8
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:00,266
You don't have to
do this every day.

9
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,202
I won't have you lost again.

10
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:04,870
I wasn't lost. I was late.
I was fibbing.

11
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:06,439
Well, you can't do that.

12
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:08,741
It throws off
a very busy schedule.

13
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:11,244
Not to mention
everything, et cetera.

14
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:13,346
Can you call housekeeping
and ask them

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,680
not to make up my bed
while I'm still in it?

16
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:17,382
Well, you won't have
to endure the hardships

17
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:18,950
of The Plaza much longer.

18
00:01:18,985 --> 00:01:21,420
The floors of your apartment
will be done Monday.

19
00:01:21,454 --> 00:01:23,888
If you pick paint, you
could move in next week.

20
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:25,890
That's great.

21
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,962
Honey, you can just have
this waiting on my desk.

22
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:33,431
Does it smell
any better in here?

23
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:35,433
If you like Airwick.

24
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,268
Fruit.

25
00:01:37,302 --> 00:01:39,870
When I was packing,
well, I think these

26
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:41,506
were best kept from the movers.

27
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:47,211
<i>Have you thought about</i>
<i>new furniture?</i>

28
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:50,079
I think it looks great in here.

29
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:53,082
No, for your apartment.
You only have a bed.

30
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:56,253
I made dinner reservations
in Farmington tomorrow.

31
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:58,688
You're taking Sally
back to school.

32
00:01:58,722 --> 00:02:00,023
Oh, thank you.

33
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:02,058
Jim Hobart's back
from vacation.

34
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:04,093
No napping.

35
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,784
You and the computer gonna
share an office over there?

36
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:33,154
No, the old girl
served her purpose.

37
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,156
McCann is Mission Control.

38
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,991
Statisticians, programmers,

39
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:39,760
five men and 10 women
just handling data.

40
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:42,596
Maybe they can keep track of your hat size.
Seems to be growing.

41
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,665
Why are you still here?

42
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,000
Somebody's got to
hand over the keys.

43
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,936
Well, I'm on 24
and you're on 26,

44
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,371
but I'll be up there
all the time.

45
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:53,574
There's an executive
dining room.

46
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:57,110
You know, I once rode on a bus to
camp sitting next to a guy like you.

47
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,512
We're not going
to be bunkmates, Crane.

48
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,614
I'll make them build
another floor if I have to.

49
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,583
I'm not going to let you
spoil the moment.

50
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,050
My moment.

51
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:07,186
See you in the funny papers.

52
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,624
I don't know what's keeping
the building representatives,

53
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,891
but I feel perfectly
comfortable--

54
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,559
Forging my signature?

55
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,261
No, that's okay.
You can go.

56
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:19,631
Well, this is my last day
and I wanted to thank you.

57
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:21,633
Bullshit.
They can't fire you.

58
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,302
Actually, I took another job.

59
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,038
Travelers Insurance.
My cousin works there.

60
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:29,841
- Look, I hate Caroline, too.
- No, it's--

61
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:31,908
- Did I do something?
- No.

62
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:35,912
It's just I kept thinking about
walking into a new office.

63
00:03:35,947 --> 00:03:37,781
I'm doing it, too.

64
00:03:37,815 --> 00:03:39,650
And now there's going to be
one less person I know.

65
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:42,085
Mr. Sterling,
it's not you.

66
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,490
Advertising is not a very
comfortable place for everyone.

67
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:49,492
Oh.

68
00:03:49,526 --> 00:03:52,662
That in mind,
I have to say thank you.

69
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:55,097
You're very amusing.

70
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,301
Fat lot of good it did me.

71
00:04:02,873 --> 00:04:05,340
Hello, neighbor.

72
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,477
We're the welcome wagon.
We heard you had a window.

73
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:10,512
Aren't you sweet to come by?

74
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:12,748
This is Beverly.
And who are you?

75
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:15,584
- I'm Libby Blum.
- Karen Schmidt.

76
00:04:15,618 --> 00:04:17,686
Can we have a minute?

77
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:21,690
- We're copywriters.
- I recognized the names.

78
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:23,291
I was just going over Tampax.

79
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:25,125
We also did the pill
for Ortho, and--

80
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,728
If it's in it, near it, or makes
you think about it, we're on it.

81
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:33,901
So Topaz Pantyhose and Butler
Shoes set off an alarm.

82
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,103
But we really love Avon.

83
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:38,138
This is incredible.

84
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:41,608
So you just came in here
to get on my business.

85
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:43,543
And to say hello.

86
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:45,912
Well, I'm flattered by both.

87
00:04:45,946 --> 00:04:48,615
If you want us, just ask
Frank in the studio.

88
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:50,183
He'll ask Bobby in traffic,

89
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:52,251
and he'll tell Carl the
associate creative director.

90
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:54,387
You can put a request in
however you want.

91
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:56,255
We'll let the Soviets
deal with it.

92
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,391
You're aware that Peggy Olson
handles all of those accounts?

93
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,461
See, I told you.

94
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:04,930
Well, we'd love to share
the crumbs with her.

95
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,734
Thank you so much
for the plant.

96
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,036
Oh, we're going to
the Oyster Bar tonight.

97
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,205
We have an informal
ladies' club.

98
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,172
It's not women's lib,
just a bitch session.

99
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:17,842
We are strictly
consciousness lowering.

100
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:20,044
When I get settled in.

101
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:35,759
Incredible.

102
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,594
Did you come to get
your furniture?

103
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,363
There was a mix-up.

104
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:41,465
My office isn't ready.

105
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,533
Why are you still here?

106
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:45,068
Well, I'm not going to McCann.

107
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:46,636
And so far I'm not
going anywhere.

108
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:48,671
And I'm being paid through
the end of the week,

109
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:50,406
so I thought I'd make some
long-distance phone calls.

110
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,274
Oh.

111
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,081
- We lost Dow.
- We still owe them work.

112
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:01,116
Could you get Mr. Kreutzer
at Sugarberry Ham for me?

113
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,518
Why would I do that?

114
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:04,486
Because Marsha's sorting
things out over there

115
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,954
and I'm not calling myself.

116
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:16,631
I'm giving you
a standing ovation.

117
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,133
How was the Bahamas?

118
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:22,002
Oh, it's everything
we say it is in print.

119
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:28,709
I hope you're finding
everything satisfactory.

120
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:30,811
Ferg's been
an excellent tour guide.

121
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:34,180
He's just following you around because
he's our resident impressionist.

122
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:36,216
Do you do an imitation
of Don yet?

123
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,886
"I'm, um, working
very diligently

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,754
on the, um,
matter at hand."

125
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:45,525
Well, you better not
make a joke of this man.

126
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:48,394
We've lined up coffee
and baloney with Nabisco,

127
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:51,731
National Cash Register, and
your old friend Conrad Hilton.

128
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:53,299
He bought you a gift.

129
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,000
That's never good.

130
00:06:55,035 --> 00:06:56,902
And we just bought
an entire agency

131
00:06:56,936 --> 00:06:58,737
in Milwaukee
to get Miller Beer.

132
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:00,539
For me?

133
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,741
When I want something,
I get it.

134
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:05,310
And I've been trying
to get you for 10 years.

135
00:07:05,344 --> 00:07:07,145
You're my "white whale," Don.

136
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:09,448
Well, maybe you should
send <i>me</i> to the Bahamas.

137
00:07:09,482 --> 00:07:11,783
In due time.
The important thing is

138
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:14,618
we're expecting you to bring
things up a notch around here.

139
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:18,756
Jim, I don't know what to tell you.
I'll do my best.

140
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,459
And, Don, this is
a shirtsleeves operation.

141
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:22,793
We want you relaxed.

142
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:24,595
And should you ever need
anything in this city,

143
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:26,330
dinner reservations,
parking tickets...

144
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:29,299
Just drop our name into yours.

145
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,434
I will.

146
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:38,307
Oh, Miller Beer
is coming in tomorrow

147
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:40,543
for handshakes
on their new idea--

148
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:41,978
diet beer.

149
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:43,680
For ladies?

150
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,048
For men watching
their waistlines.

151
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,583
Why don't we call it "Tub"?

152
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:51,887
- Have you said it yet?
- What?

153
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,389
Have you introduced yourself?

154
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,094
I'm Don Draper
from McCann-Erickson.

155
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:08,335
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

156
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,170
<i>Mostly because it's hard</i>
<i>for me to walk around here</i>

157
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:11,939
<i>acting like nothing's changed.</i>

158
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:13,641
Only some things have changed.

159
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:16,544
Avon will be serviced
by the exact same personnel.

160
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:18,713
Creative handled by
Ted Chaough and Peggy Olson.

161
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:21,414
Forget about personnel.
Every dollar you spend

162
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:23,884
will now get you
five times the audience.

163
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,085
And once we get you on TV...

164
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,121
<i>Well, we already are on TV.</i>

165
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:31,090
We know that.
What Dennis is saying is--

166
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,859
You know, I'm in Atlanta
all the time.

167
00:08:32,894 --> 00:08:35,395
How about a trip to
Augusta, play a few holes?

168
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,263
You any good?

169
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:38,564
<i>No.</i>

170
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,568
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

171
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:46,471
<i>Listen, my girl is telling me that
it's time for our staff meeting.</i>

172
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:48,106
<i>Thanks again for the call.</i>

173
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:50,843
Of course.
Such a pleasure, Barry.

174
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:52,878
Bye.

175
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:57,081
- Who's next?
- I don't know what to say,

176
00:08:57,115 --> 00:08:59,116
except Barry
is in a wheelchair.

177
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:01,686
- <i>What?</i>
- I told you that.

178
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,655
And I wrote it down.

179
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,624
Oh, I thought that
was Charlie Butler

180
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:08,693
from the shoes.

181
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:11,795
No, it's not.
And it's <i>Charles</i> Butler.

182
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,664
And it's <i>footwear.</i>

183
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:15,231
I can't believe you.

184
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:16,800
It's an honest mistake.

185
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,969
You heard him say he was
"walking around the office."

186
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:20,571
It's an expression.

187
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,139
Which he shouldn't
be able to use.

188
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:25,609
I stayed up all night
preparing those briefs.

189
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:28,911
Mr. Donnelly said you'd be on the
call to help with the transition.

190
00:09:28,946 --> 00:09:31,647
But you seem like you don't even
care about keeping these accounts.

191
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:35,184
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:38,253
Who told you you got
to get pissed off?

193
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:48,897
All I ask is that you please read
the brief before our next call.

194
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:51,365
You know what?

195
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,434
Do it yourself.

196
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,037
I thought you were
going to be fun.

197
00:10:23,764 --> 00:10:25,564
I'm sorry to drop by.

198
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:29,836
Oh, Marsha.
That's so sweet of you.

199
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,872
You didn't have to come up here.
It's not your fault.

200
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:34,874
Those are actually from McCann.

201
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:37,308
An apology.
That's classy.

202
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:39,244
How do I explain this?

203
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:41,246
All the SC&P girls got flowers.

204
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,682
It's still classy.

205
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:46,184
Well, all the new secretaries.

206
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:49,254
They thought I was a secretary?

207
00:10:50,422 --> 00:10:52,124
Did you tell Don what happened?

208
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,025
- Do you want me to?
- No.

209
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,293
Maybe I should call Joan.

210
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:57,995
That's not her job there.

211
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,931
- I know that, Marsha.
- I am taking care of it.

212
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:03,134
As well as your mail
and memos regarding

213
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,469
Peter Pan Peanut Butter
and Tampax.

214
00:11:05,503 --> 00:11:07,204
What happened to all my things?

215
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:08,973
They're putting
your boxes in storage.

216
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:10,407
You will have
an office any minute.

217
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,776
In the meantime,
you can work in the pool.

218
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,444
I am a copy supervisor.

219
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:19,215
I am not setting foot in there
until I have an office.

220
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:21,718
If they want me,
they can reach me here.

221
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:23,920
At home?

222
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:28,724
No. No.
I'll be at SC&P.

223
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:30,793
Hell, that's where
my furniture is.

224
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,394
I will let them know.

225
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:44,106
<i>Could you hold that?</i>

226
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:48,910
Good morning.
How are you, stranger?

227
00:11:48,944 --> 00:11:51,278
Homesick.

228
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:55,683
Well, takes some time
to settle in.

229
00:11:55,718 --> 00:11:57,518
I know.

230
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:59,153
You should come by for a drink.

231
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:01,988
When am I going to do that?

232
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,862
Put me on your calendar.

233
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,663
We don't share any accounts.

234
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:12,032
You're too important.

235
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,299
Not for you.

236
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,868
Believe me,

237
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,070
I'd involve you if I could.

238
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:19,371
It's been a little bumpy.

239
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,241
I can still interfere.

240
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,543
No, I'll figure it out.

241
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,846
Of that I am certain.

242
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,917
Let's make a date for lunch.

243
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,786
Soon.

244
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,290
<i>Tell me if you
like the general idea</i>

245
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:49,092
<i>so I can take a few risks.</i>

246
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:50,393
Where did you learn to do this?

247
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,162
I'm an army brat, remember?

248
00:12:52,196 --> 00:12:53,695
New base every year.

249
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,398
I want to live here.

250
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:58,768
You're my decorator.
I'll pay you in cash.

251
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:00,669
Nonsense.
I love it.

252
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:03,873
Lunch in the executive
boardroom with Miller Beer.

253
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:05,908
They asked if roast beef
was okay.

254
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,977
Perfect.

255
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:16,017
Joan, it's nice
to see you up here.

256
00:13:16,051 --> 00:13:18,486
Are you coming to the Sears briefing?
That's a good idea.

257
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,222
No, I was actually
looking for Mr. Donnelly.

258
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:23,057
- But if now is a bad time--
- Ferg.

259
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:25,827
Pete, it's your meeting.
You can start without me.

260
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:28,595
I'm gonna put in a request to
get you involved with this.

261
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:31,965
Thank you.
That's thoughtful.

262
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,400
So what can I do for you?

263
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:35,803
It's just--

264
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:37,905
regarding the Avon transition,

265
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:40,573
I thought maybe Pete
could be an asset.

266
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:43,476
Pete's a vice president.
What's wrong with Dennis?

267
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,411
I like Dennis personally.

268
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:48,347
I'm not sure the client
responded to him.

269
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:50,382
Say no more.

270
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,185
I'll take care of it.

271
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,627
Hello?

272
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:12,670
Are those my boxes?

273
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:16,574
I gotta go.
I gotta go.

274
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:19,143
Yeah, I signed for them, but I
was wondering what happened.

275
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:21,212
Ugh, you've got
to be kidding me.

276
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:23,347
You know we're
the only ones here.

277
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,216
Have you been on
the phone all morning?

278
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,719
Stan called.
He doesn't have a phone yet.

279
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:31,521
He's on the 14th floor.
Come by and say hi.

280
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:32,890
And...

281
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:35,892
I prepared this
for your approval.

282
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:40,163
_

283
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:43,132
- What is this?
- <i>Do you think "quagmire" should be plural?</i>

284
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,501
We can't do this.

285
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:47,737
They're never going
to look at it.

286
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:50,974
Ed, you could easily end up
working for Dow again,

287
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,507
or Ken Cosgrove.

288
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,209
You could even end up
working for me.

289
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:00,648
That's not very subtle.

290
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:03,986
I asked you to do one damn thing
and you didn't even do it.

291
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,421
Fine. I quit.

292
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:14,228
Well, thanks for everything.

293
00:15:16,164 --> 00:15:20,034
When you get settled in over
there, which will happen,

294
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,903
give me a call?

295
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,105
I promise.

296
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:45,791
I'm sorry.
It's Bob, right?

297
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,492
Yes. Don,
good to see you.

298
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:49,328
We've got the best
box lunch around.

299
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,297
It should have your name on it.

300
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:52,764
Is this the Miller
Beer meeting?

301
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,935
It certainly is. Bill
Phillips, Conley Research.

302
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:58,037
Don Draper and Ted Chaough.

303
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:00,271
- A pleasure.
- Shall we?

304
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:04,175
Is this every creative
director in the agency?

305
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:06,177
It's only half of us.

306
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:11,182
So are you here to
"bring us up a notch," too?

307
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,750
So they tell me.

308
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,490
Good morning, gentlemen.

309
00:16:20,524 --> 00:16:22,459
As you know this
is Bill Phillips,

310
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:25,095
Senior Director
at Conley Research.

311
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:29,032
Bill, why don't you tell us a little
bit about this exciting new beverage?

312
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:34,170
Despite that pile of facts
and figures in front of you,

313
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:36,872
I don't look at this as
a presentation of research.

314
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:40,076
To me, this is
an opportunity to stimulate

315
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,845
some of our industry's
finest imaginations.

316
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:46,015
<i>I'm going to describe</i>
<i>a man to you</i>

317
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:48,351
of very specific qualities.

318
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:51,386
He lives in Wisconsin,

319
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,655
Michigan, Ohio.

320
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,724
Some call it
"the Heartland."

321
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:59,227
Some call it
"the Beer Belt."

322
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:01,629
He has some college.

323
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:04,032
<i>Makes a good living,</i>

324
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:07,702
<i>but it doesn't feel like it</i>
<i>because he works long hours.</i>

325
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:11,205
He has a lawn mower.

326
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,474
<i>Wants a hammock.</i>

327
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:17,444
<i>Bunch of power tools in the
garage that he never uses.</i>

328
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:20,147
He loves sports because
he used to play 'em.

329
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:23,583
And he loves dogs
because they don't talk.

330
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:28,321
We all know this man.

331
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:31,190
Because there are
millions of him.

332
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:33,493
<i>And he drinks beer.</i>

333
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,428
<i>Not just any beer.</i>

334
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:38,097
<i>No, it has to be his brand.</i>

335
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:41,534
<i>And what is his brand?</i>

336
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:43,701
<i>The one he drank in college?</i>

337
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:45,803
<i>The one his dad drank?</i>

338
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:49,107
<i>The one that comes in</i>
<i>the best bottle, can, tap?</i>

339
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:52,710
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>because that's it</i>

340
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:55,547
<i>and it's not open</i>
<i>for discussion.</i>

341
00:17:55,581 --> 00:17:58,183
<i>Now you all know</i>
<i>that that's not true.</i>

342
00:17:58,217 --> 00:18:00,751
<i>But how do you get him</i>
<i>to open his mind?</i>

343
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:03,120
<i>Better have something more.</i>

344
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:06,323
<i>Or in this case, less.</i>

345
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,292
And that's tricky.

346
00:18:08,326 --> 00:18:12,063
When we talk about
a low-calorie beer,

347
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:14,432
we immediately become feminine.

348
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:17,067
It's the word
"calorie."

349
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,569
<i>It makes you think</i>
<i>of a reducing plan.</i>

350
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:22,905
<i>A note on the fridge</i>
<i>to remind her about her diet.</i>

351
00:18:27,244 --> 00:18:28,578
Your girl still at lunch?

352
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,081
Beverly always takes the whole hour.
I insist.

353
00:18:34,784 --> 00:18:36,251
I have a little news for you.

354
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:38,187
Oh, I hope I didn't
'cause any trouble.

355
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,854
Too early for you?

356
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:41,957
No, of course not.

357
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:48,263
So, I spoke with Dennis.

358
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:50,298
I hope I didn't
ruffle any feathers.

359
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:55,536
Well, here's how it looks.

360
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:57,871
Like some junior
account man came in

361
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:59,407
and started
swinging her elbows.

362
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:02,610
He didn't read the brief.
And I'm not Dennis's junior.

363
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:05,113
Joan, see it from his side.

364
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:06,880
He has a wife
and three children.

365
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:08,648
He's not going
to work for a <i>girl.</i>

366
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:10,250
What's he gonna say
to a client?

367
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,252
"She's my boss"?

368
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,921
It happens all the time now.

369
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:17,491
Peggy Olson was our copy chief.

370
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:20,494
It's different with a bunch of
writers fresh out of Columbia.

371
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:23,196
And honestly, I doubt that's
gonna continue here anyway.

372
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,298
I see.

373
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:30,035
Joan, I didn't come
down here to upset you.

374
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,104
I agree that the best way
to keep the business

375
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:34,140
is to keep your status
on your accounts.

376
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,774
Oh.

377
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,709
And you'll certainly get
the respect you desire,

378
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,378
now it's just you and me.

379
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:42,913
You don't have to do that,
but I accept.

380
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,253
Mm, good.

381
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,688
Now, first thing we have to
do is pay this guy a visit.

382
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,990
- Who?
- Barry from Avon.

383
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,626
We owe him an apology.

384
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,794
And let's face it, it would
be good to get out of town,

385
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,262
even if it's to Atlanta.

386
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:00,930
I appreciate that, but I
don't want to put you out.

387
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:05,502
Look, I know a good job
when I see one.

388
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:10,907
No, it's just
that might be too much.

389
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:12,609
He'll be in New York soon

390
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,811
and Avon corporate
is blocks away.

391
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:16,812
Hey, I'm easy.

392
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,681
I'm not expecting anything
more than a good time.

393
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:21,284
Excuse me?

394
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:24,387
I mean, I want to get
to know you, of course.

395
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,390
Of course.

396
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:29,325
Good.

397
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,026
For my first act
of benevolence,

398
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,494
you can call Charles
Butler on your own.

399
00:20:32,528 --> 00:20:33,861
We'll take him
to lunch next week.

400
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:35,863
Thank you.

401
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,570
From now on, no one comes
between me and your business.

402
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:43,905
I appreciate that.

403
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,943
We can't lose those accounts.

404
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:52,079
What would you do around here?

405
00:21:02,516 --> 00:21:04,583
Loretta.

406
00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:10,755
Here she is.

407
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,759
- Sally left?
- Yes.

408
00:21:14,794 --> 00:21:16,461
She got a ride with her friend.

409
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:18,797
And no one thought
to call me, I guess.

410
00:21:18,831 --> 00:21:20,399
Do you want something to drink?

411
00:21:20,433 --> 00:21:22,934
- No.
- They left after lunch.

412
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:24,902
I told her to call your office.

413
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:26,804
Your secretary is a moron.

414
00:21:26,838 --> 00:21:29,506
I was out of the office. I
wanted to get the car washed.

415
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:32,009
She comes and goes
as she pleases.

416
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:34,211
We can't get mad at her
for being independent.

417
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:35,846
It's normal.

418
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:39,483
That what Freud says?

419
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:43,086
So far I haven't come
across anyone normal.

420
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,790
You okay?

421
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:51,361
I carried $100 worth
of textbooks yesterday

422
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,129
during registration.

423
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,168
Maybe you're getting old.

424
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:02,104
- I'm younger than you.
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:04,406
Always have been,
always will be.

426
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:09,178
Maybe you could find some nice
freshman to carry your books.

427
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:13,382
That's fine.

428
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,989
When do the boys get home?

429
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:23,824
Gene's at Cub Scouts

430
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:25,460
and Bobby's got baseball.

431
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:27,661
They won't be back
until 6:30.

432
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:35,335
I'll let you get back
to your studies.

433
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,971
I've always wanted to do this.

434
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:41,741
Knock 'em dead, Birdie.

435
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:45,512
Bye.

436
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:06,797
Shit.

437
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:43,132
Your stomach is grumbling.

438
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,601
You never let me eat.

439
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:47,703
I can make fried chicken.

440
00:23:49,073 --> 00:23:50,440
I don't mind playing house,

441
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:52,108
but as long as your mother
and Kevin are away,

442
00:23:52,142 --> 00:23:54,243
why don't you call in sick?

443
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:56,445
Let me take you to Bermuda.

444
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,979
No.

445
00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:00,815
Cape Cod?

446
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:02,917
I don't want to go anywhere
I don't want to go.

447
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:05,053
Don't make plans for me.

448
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:07,622
All right.
All right.

449
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,360
I have a lot of work.

450
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:16,397
Look, I know I told you
not to complain,

451
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:18,999
but that doesn't mean I don't
want to hear about it.

452
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:24,037
But you really don't.

453
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,374
What happened?

454
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,245
It's a big place and I asked
the wrong person for help.

455
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,715
And I don't think
I can get out of it.

456
00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:39,119
Well, if you don't like that
job, you don't have to do it.

457
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:43,289
You got enough and you got me.

458
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:45,858
They still owe me
over half a million dollars.

459
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:47,526
I'm not walking away from that.

460
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,028
So this is a business problem.

461
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:52,664
Now I can help.

462
00:24:56,736 --> 00:24:58,303
You're already helping.

463
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:01,840
There's two ways I deal
with disagreeable people.

464
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:04,542
One, you can call a lawyer,

465
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:07,044
throw a bunch of paper at them,

466
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:10,148
tie them up in court,
cost them some money.

467
00:25:10,182 --> 00:25:12,750
Nobody wins,

468
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:14,952
but it loosens the earth.

469
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:17,054
What's the second?

470
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:19,423
You can call a guy.

471
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,391
"A guy"?

472
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:24,161
I'm a developer.
Men get stubborn.

473
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:26,829
What does "a guy" do?

474
00:25:26,864 --> 00:25:30,099
You get the right guy, all
they have to do is show up.

475
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:33,537
You've really done that?

476
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:36,839
You seem to like it,
so I'm gonna say yes.

477
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:41,076
You're disturbed.

478
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,012

Where are you going?

494
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:30,756
Racine, Wisconsin.
Ever been there?

495
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:33,426
No.
What's in Racine?

496
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,429
Maybe some waitress

509
00:27:38,554 --> 00:27:41,022
- Yes. Who is this?
- It's Marsha.

510
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:43,224
I thought I would try this
before I ran over.

511
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,194
- Your phone's dead.
- What do you want?

512
00:27:46,228 --> 00:27:48,697
Well, on behalf
of McCann-Erickson,

513
00:27:48,731 --> 00:27:50,699
I want to welcome you
to your new office.

514
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,434
<i>When can you come over?</i>

515
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:54,135
Well, I guess right now.

516
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,970
Wonderful. Can you work
at a drafting table

517
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:58,906
until they bring your things
over tomorrow?

518
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,609
Yes. Thank you.

519
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:10,118
Hello?

520
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,454
Is someone there?

521
00:28:49,955 --> 00:28:52,857
- Roger.
- Oh, Christ!

522
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:55,025
I have a heart
condition, you know.

523
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,562
Believe it or not,
I'm not scary.

524
00:28:57,596 --> 00:29:00,264
Organ music is scary.
What are you doing here?

525
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:02,799
I told Caroline I wanted
to pack my personal things,

526
00:29:02,834 --> 00:29:04,901
which I will eventually do

527
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:07,036
as soon as I figure out why she
thought my bar wasn't personal.

528
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:09,105
Did you try Don's office?

529
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:10,874
All I found was lighter fluid.

530
00:29:10,908 --> 00:29:12,141
I'm not there yet.

531
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:13,844
Mine's gone.

532
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:17,180
I don't want to go to a bar.
I did that yesterday.

533
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,448
Listen, sweetheart,
if you don't mind...

534
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:22,251
I'm not running an errand.
I have to go to McCann.

535
00:29:22,285 --> 00:29:24,152
Three days ago.

536
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:26,722
They screwed up
my office--

537
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:29,392
It doesn't matter.
They're finally ready.

538
00:29:29,426 --> 00:29:31,594
I'd do it for you.

539
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:33,429
Would you drink vermouth?

540
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,298
Yes, I'm afraid I would.

541
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:45,487
_

542
00:29:51,781 --> 00:29:53,347
I'll be along in a minute.

543
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:56,016
Oh, Mr. Hobart.
Can I help you?

544
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,684
You're sitting in his chair.

545
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,286
You're obviously
not expecting him.

546
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,688
I told Daphne I don't
know when he'll be in.

547
00:30:01,723 --> 00:30:03,089
Can I take a message?

548
00:30:03,124 --> 00:30:05,025
Sure.

549
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:08,361
Tell him he missed Nabisco
and National Cash Register just left,

550
00:30:08,396 --> 00:30:10,297
so he might as well take
the rest of the day off.

551
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:13,365
Thank you.
I'll let him know.

552
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,604
Is he on a bender, sweetheart?

553
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:20,372
I haven't heard from him,

554
00:30:20,407 --> 00:30:22,141
but he went to take
his daughter to school.

555
00:30:22,175 --> 00:30:23,810
I'm not concerned.

556
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:50,059
Look at this.
"Christmas Day, 1951."

557
00:30:51,294 --> 00:30:54,663
- Who's Roberta?
- I don't know.

558
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:57,933
Oh.

559
00:30:57,968 --> 00:31:00,168
Roberta.

560
00:31:00,203 --> 00:31:01,836
Hmm.

561
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,972
We had our drink.

562
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:07,374
You clearly don't need help.
You need an audience.

563
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:10,078
McCann made you wait.
You can make them wait.

564
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:12,580
I'm not enjoying this.

565
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:20,587
Oh, my God.
What is this?

566
00:31:20,622 --> 00:31:22,789
It's an octopus
pleasuring a lady.

567
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,458
It was Cooper's.

568
00:31:25,493 --> 00:31:28,028
It was in his office forever.
You can have it.

569
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:29,429
You can put it in <i>your</i> office.

570
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:32,365
No. They won't
take me seriously.

571
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,167
That's pretty serious.
It's 150 years old.

572
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:38,337
You know I need to make
men feel at ease.

573
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:40,039
Who told you that?

574
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:41,540
So now I gave you something,

575
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:43,575
you can sit tight
and keep me company.

576
00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:49,148
You think you're gonna have
fun like this over there?

577
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,019
This is more attention than
I've ever gotten from you.

578
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:56,621
You should see the floor I'm on.
It's a nursing home.

579
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:59,557
What the hell happened?

580
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:02,093
You're acting like you
had nothing to do with this.

581
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,796
I'll have you know,
I held this place together.

582
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,399
I know you think that,
but you actually sold it.

583
00:32:08,433 --> 00:32:10,968
You were supposed
to watch out for us.

584
00:32:11,002 --> 00:32:14,471
This business
doesn't have feelings.

585
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:17,041
You get bought, you get
sold, you get fired.

586
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:20,310
If the account moves, you move.

587
00:32:20,344 --> 00:32:22,012
Even if your name's
on the damn door,

588
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:25,615
you should know better than to
get attached to some walls.

589
00:32:27,284 --> 00:32:30,119
Well, hopefully I'll have
that problem someday.

590
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:33,890
Okay, hot stuff.

591
00:32:36,093 --> 00:32:38,061
It's exciting.

592
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:41,430
I mean, I know it's going
to be challenging,

593
00:32:41,464 --> 00:32:45,767
but I needed that.
So do you.

594
00:32:48,571 --> 00:32:51,306
In the summer of '44,
it was over 100 degrees

595
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,141
every day in the Pacific.

596
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:56,211
So we dropped anchor in the
Ulithi Lagoon to go for a swim.

597
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:58,413
And you can imagine
the men--

598
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:00,981
it was bedlam.

599
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:04,284
But...
I couldn't do it.

600
00:33:06,188 --> 00:33:07,321
Can't you swim?

601
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:09,456
Did I mention
I was in the navy?

602
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,293
No, the real problem was it was a
two-story drop off our cruiser.

603
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:16,530
We all have regrets.

604
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:19,665
No, I did it.

605
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,367
I just needed a push.

606
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,908
This was a hell
of a boat, you know?

607
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:33,279
Come on.

608
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,787
It just looks good now,

609
00:33:41,821 --> 00:33:45,257
but it was miserable when
you were in it. Trust me.

610
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,692
Is that really how you're
gonna remember this place?

611
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:52,163
No.

612
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,465
Good.

613
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,405
This is the one
for the road, okay?

614
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,641
You gonna show up drunk

615
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,943
at 4:00
on your first day?

616
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,950
You know any Freemasons?

617
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,391
Yes?
Can I help you?

618
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,693
I'm looking for
Mrs. Baur.

619
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:25,694
I'm Mrs. Baur.

620
00:34:25,728 --> 00:34:28,330
Good evening. I hope I'm not
disturbing your dinner.

621
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:31,200
Not yet. My husband will
be home any minute.

622
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:34,270
Well, I really just need
to talk to you.

623
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:37,639
I'm Bill Phillips
from Conley Research.

624
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:41,243
We represent an array
of American companies

625
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:43,111
including Miller Beer.

626
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:45,479
And out of over 900 entries,

627
00:34:45,514 --> 00:34:47,648
you, Diana Baur,
were chosen to win

628
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:51,252
a brand-new Westinghouse
refrigerator full of Miller Beer.

629
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:53,654
Oh.

630
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:57,125
Now, you have your choice,
white or harvest gold.

631
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,726
That's the fridge,
not the beer, of course.

632
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,963
Well, that sounds wonderful,

633
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:06,033
but I'm not Diana, I'm Laura.

634
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:07,767
Can I still accept it?

635
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:09,669
I don't know.

636
00:35:09,704 --> 00:35:12,472
I'm supposed to speak to Diana.

637
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:14,274
Is your mother home?

638
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,712
You really should
speak to my husband.

639
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:22,281
She's his ex-wife.

640
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:25,718
I guess if he knows where
she is, I could come back.

641
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:28,888
Or wait in the car.

642
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:32,225
My neighbors have seen you
on the porch long enough.

643
00:35:32,259 --> 00:35:34,326
Come on inside.

644
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,935
Have a seat. Would you
like some iced tea?

645
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,904
- I don't want to be a bother.
- It's no bother.

646
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:47,505
I have to check on the chicken.

647
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,288
Are you looking for my mother?

648
00:36:06,224 --> 00:36:08,358
Diana is your mother?

649
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:11,294
If she won something,
I should get it.

650
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,900
Yes, that makes sense.

651
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,510
Sorry to keep you waiting.

652
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,045
It was no problem at all.

653
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:37,719
I hope you're finding
everything satisfactory.

654
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:40,155
Well, I'm here
because I need your help.

655
00:36:40,189 --> 00:36:42,356
I'm at your disposal.

656
00:36:42,391 --> 00:36:45,793
I don't know how to put this,

657
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:47,561
but I don't feel
that my accounts

658
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:49,663
are getting the right
kind of attention.

659
00:36:49,697 --> 00:36:51,399
<i>Our</i> accounts.

660
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:53,234
Well, that's just it.

661
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:56,237
I fully expect to service clients
with the help of your personnel.

662
00:36:56,271 --> 00:36:59,505
But as a partner at SC&P,

663
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,975
I had a certain amount
of status.

664
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:04,144
You know, more independence.

665
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,480
What's the problem?
You can speak freely.

666
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:10,716
Well, I don't think that Ferg
Donnelly is a good match.

667
00:37:12,386 --> 00:37:14,421
Ferg's very
important around here.

668
00:37:14,455 --> 00:37:17,689
Frankly, you're lucky he's taken
an interest in your business.

669
00:37:17,723 --> 00:37:20,225
I understand that,
but it's not necessary.

670
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,494
I don't mean to brag, but I've
been handling this account

671
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:24,163
on my own
since I brought it in.

672
00:37:24,197 --> 00:37:26,198
I'm sure that's true.

673
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:30,102
But you're gonna have to get used
to doing things the way we do them.

674
00:37:30,136 --> 00:37:32,603
Well, I don't know
how to say this,

675
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:34,738
but I can't work with him.

676
00:37:36,442 --> 00:37:38,242
Joan, it may not have sunk in,

677
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:41,245
but your <i>status</i> has changed.

678
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,016
Avon, Butler Footwear,
Topaz Pantyhose--

679
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,750
I guess you don't need
those accounts.

680
00:37:48,887 --> 00:37:50,920
I've tried to be patient,

681
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:55,258
but I don't care about
your SC&P partnership.

682
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:57,961
I don't know if somebody left
it to you in their will,

683
00:37:57,996 --> 00:38:00,630
but your little stake
doesn't mean anything here.

684
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:03,266
Is that what you want?

685
00:38:03,301 --> 00:38:05,635
Because I'm perfectly happy

686
00:38:05,669 --> 00:38:08,504
to take my half a million
dollars and be on my way.

687
00:38:10,107 --> 00:38:12,475
I'll bet people always say
you're the kind of gal

688
00:38:12,509 --> 00:38:15,711
who doesn't take no
for an answer.

689
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:19,882
But no, you're not telling
me how to run my business.

690
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,951
Now find a way to get along

691
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:25,520
or you can expect
a letter from our lawyer.

692
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:29,790
I wonder how many women around here
would like to speak to a lawyer.

693
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,763
I think the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission has one.

694
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:39,800
Women love it here.

695
00:38:39,835 --> 00:38:43,737
You want to threaten us?
You'll be all alone.

696
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:45,239
No.

697
00:38:45,273 --> 00:38:47,707
I think the second
I file a complaint,

698
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,244
I'll have the ACLU in my office

699
00:38:50,278 --> 00:38:51,978
and Betty Friedan in the lobby

700
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:54,481
with half the women
who marched down Fifth Avenue.

701
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:57,583
I guess you didn't see the headlines about
what happened at "Ladies' Home Journal."

702
00:38:57,617 --> 00:38:59,818
Or "Newsweek."

703
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:02,355
Do you have any idea
how much space

704
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:04,757
McCann buys in "The New
York Times" every year?

705
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:08,261
We could get them to print "Mein
Kampf" on the front page.

706
00:39:08,295 --> 00:39:11,230
Yes, I'm sure I'll find it
difficult to find a reporter

707
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,466
who wants to embarrass
you this deeply.

708
00:39:19,972 --> 00:39:23,341
Look, you're unhappy.

709
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:25,544
And now I'm unhappy.

710
00:39:25,578 --> 00:39:27,679
So how about this--

711
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:30,148
I'm willing to give you
50 cents on the dollar

712
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:32,583
to never see your face again.

713
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:35,453
I guess I wasn't clear.

714
00:39:35,487 --> 00:39:38,355
I'm not negotiating.

715
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:44,395
Then you should get out
of my office immediately.

716
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:53,169
Go ahead.

717
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:56,473
I'd rather give it to a lawyer.

718
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:11,520
So you get to drive
all over America

719
00:40:11,554 --> 00:40:12,754
giving people prizes?

720
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:14,957
That sounds like fun.

721
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:17,460
Well, I also give a lot
of boring presentations.

722
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,864
- Hello.
- Hello, honey.

723
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:24,833
This is Bill Phillips.

724
00:40:24,868 --> 00:40:27,902
He says Diana won
some kind of prize.

725
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:30,138
A refrigerator
full of Miller Beer.

726
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:32,907
Really?

727
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:36,211
Well, there's been
some confusion

728
00:40:36,245 --> 00:40:39,780
because a Mrs. Diana Baur
entered our contest

729
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,083
and, well, she's
nowhere to be found.

730
00:40:42,118 --> 00:40:44,918
Diana never entered
any contest.

731
00:40:44,952 --> 00:40:47,321
Well, I guess it's a mistake.

732
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:50,690
Yeah, letting you in our house.

733
00:40:50,725 --> 00:40:53,027
And my wife, she doesn't
know any better,

734
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:55,295
- but I guess you knew that.
- Cliff, please.

735
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,897
Let him answer.

736
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:00,967
Who the heck are you?

737
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:02,902
Or do I have to call
the police?

738
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:10,543
You're right.

739
00:41:10,577 --> 00:41:13,879
I'm deeply sorry
for the ruse, ma'am.

740
00:41:13,914 --> 00:41:15,915
But I work for
a collection agency.

741
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:19,751
Clearly you're not responsible
for Mrs. Baur anymore,

742
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:22,987
but I need to know
her whereabouts.

743
00:41:25,891 --> 00:41:28,160
Last I heard,
she was in New York.

744
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,895
- Do you have an address?
- No.

745
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,731
That's all I got.

746
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,667
I apologize for the intrusion.

747
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,180
Guess we're not as dumb
as you think we are.

748
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:52,015
- I'm leaving.
- The clothes, the shoes, the Caddy?

749
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:55,851
- You're no collection agent.
- I am.

750
00:41:55,886 --> 00:41:58,121
You think you're the first one
that came looking for her?

751
00:41:58,155 --> 00:42:00,022
She's a tornado

752
00:42:00,057 --> 00:42:02,492
just leaving a trail of
broken bodies behind her.

753
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:08,198
I didn't mean to disturb you.

754
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:10,732
Yeah, but you did.

755
00:42:10,766 --> 00:42:13,202
I am just starting
to get back on my feet.

756
00:42:13,236 --> 00:42:16,538
Just starting to get back to even
part of the way to where I was.

757
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:18,940
Look, I'm sorry.

758
00:42:18,975 --> 00:42:21,176
I was worried about her.

759
00:42:24,247 --> 00:42:26,680
She seemed so lost.

760
00:42:26,715 --> 00:42:29,317
Well, I lost my daughter to God

761
00:42:29,351 --> 00:42:30,751
and my wife to the devil.

762
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:32,753
I lost everything.

763
00:42:32,787 --> 00:42:34,322
That what you wanted to know?

764
00:42:34,356 --> 00:42:36,957
No.

765
00:42:36,992 --> 00:42:40,428
You can't save her.

766
00:42:40,462 --> 00:42:42,830
Only Jesus can.

767
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:44,664
He'll help you, too.

768
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:46,166
Ask Him.

769
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,669
- Look, I--
- And don't come back.

770
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:59,078
Come on, once more
from the top.

771
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,383
Where the hell have you been?

772
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,385
I had a lot of stuff to move.

773
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:43,520
Are any of you
planning to work here,

774
00:43:43,555 --> 00:43:45,522
or is this the con
of the century?

775
00:43:45,557 --> 00:43:48,225
Look, calm down.
We're all just settling in.

776
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,327
Calm down?
Where the hell is Don?

777
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,761
He walked out of a meeting
Wednesday and hasn't come back.

778
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,630
He does that.

779
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:58,133
Well, you may have
sold me a rotten apple,

780
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,469
but it's not too late
to let the ax fly.

781
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:02,104
Starting with that redhead.

782
00:44:02,138 --> 00:44:03,306
Joan?

783
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,942
I don't want to hear
her name again.

784
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:34,101
Good morning.
You made it.

785
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:37,104
You just come to work
like nothing happened?

786
00:44:37,138 --> 00:44:39,740
I'm here and I'm doing my job.

787
00:44:39,774 --> 00:44:42,209
Get the door.

788
00:44:47,814 --> 00:44:50,116
Jim Hobart's not afraid of you.

789
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:51,584
Then why'd he send you?

790
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:53,185
To tell you I can't help you.

791
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,688
Well, thank you very much.

792
00:44:55,723 --> 00:44:57,423
Listen to me.

793
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:59,791
You're not going to do better
than 50 cents on the dollar.

794
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:01,460
It's not about the money.

795
00:45:01,494 --> 00:45:03,061
It's only about the money.

796
00:45:03,095 --> 00:45:04,696
Don't hide behind politics.

797
00:45:04,731 --> 00:45:06,798
Take the money
and be done with them.

798
00:45:06,832 --> 00:45:08,933
Take half my money?

799
00:45:08,968 --> 00:45:12,504
I know it's all my fault and
I'm trying to take care of it.

800
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:14,573
You've started something that
could leave you with nothing.

801
00:45:16,408 --> 00:45:17,908
It's plenty.

802
00:45:17,942 --> 00:45:20,210
I made sure he's good for it.

803
00:45:45,603 --> 00:45:47,604
Tell him he has a deal.

804
00:46:16,031 --> 00:46:18,433
- Where you headed?
- St. Paul.

805
00:46:19,835 --> 00:46:21,502
I can go that way.

806
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:23,671
Great.

807
00:46:32,647 --> 00:46:35,048
I don't want to take you
out of your way, man.

808
00:46:35,082 --> 00:46:37,083
It's not a problem.
