I need your license
and registration

8
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:26,470
and I need to know
what you were doing.

9
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:27,805
I'm driving.

10
00:01:27,857 --> 00:01:29,773
Don't get smart with me.

11
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:31,809
We've been looking for you.

12
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:35,195
There's been a mistake.

13
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:38,982
You knew we'd catch up
with you eventually.

14
00:01:57,753 --> 00:01:59,219
I can't find any baking soda.

15
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:01,004
We're gonna have
to make do with Colgate.

16
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:03,223
On my arm?

17
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,677
Well, you're back early.

18
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:08,846
Well, we had to skip lunch.

19
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:11,348
- Hello, Sherry.
- Hello.

20
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,016
I got stinged.

21
00:02:13,068 --> 00:02:15,686
Oh, sweetheart.

22
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:18,906
We were up at Lyman Orchards.
It's mostly bees.

23
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:21,525
Daddy put toothpaste on it.

24
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:23,193
Yes, and you're
no worse for wear.

25
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:24,578
Not allergic, thankfully.

26
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,497
I'm terribly so.

27
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,000
I have an hour. I suppose
we could still grab lunch.

28
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:32,336
No, this is fine.
She should probably rest.

29
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:34,505
I'll see you Thursday,
Wonder Woman.

30
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,874
We'll go to Friendly's.

31
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:43,680
Well, I'm off.

32
00:02:47,853 --> 00:02:49,853
Go inside and lay down,
sweetheart.

33
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:54,141
Every time Bill has the kids,

34
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:55,642
something terrible happens.

35
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,063
The incredible thing is
I make her lunch,

36
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:02,733
I take her to school,
I read to her every night,

37
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:04,902
and he spends Sunday
and Thursday night with her

38
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:06,403
and that's all I hear about.

39
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:08,071
Well, I admire you.

40
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,458
Are you trying to get me
to make you lunch?

41
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:15,329
No, I think it's admirable that you
haven't poisoned her against him.

42
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:17,881
I don't know if I could
have that restraint.

43
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:19,583
Yes, you would.

44
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:21,501
Because you'd be concerned
about your child

45
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:23,670
and do your best
to forget things.

46
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:27,591
And not expect your friends
to remind you all the time.

47
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:30,177
I am so sorry.

48
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:32,429
That is not what
I was trying to say.

49
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,482
I know.

50
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:40,437
Would you like some of these?

51
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:44,107
So what happened
to field hockey?

52
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:47,277
If I'm on the yearbook,
I won't be a benchwarmer.

53
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,447
Well, can you quit before I buy
you cleats and a stick next time?

54
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:52,366
I'm going to sell everything.

55
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:54,284
You know how much
Madrid's going to cost?

56
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,336
I'm not gonna back out of that.

57
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:57,921
I want to go to Spain.

58
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,590
I want to go to Spain.

59
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,509
You think it'll be more
interesting than Wyoming?

60
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:06,129
I don't know.
Wyoming had a two-headed cow.

61
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:07,631
You'll see it on the postcard.

62
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:10,133
So where's next?

63
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:13,937
Well, I'm in Kansas right now.

64
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,891
I'm going to take Route 35.

65
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:20,394
Then over on 40.

66
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:23,647
<i>Then 89 to the Grand Canyon.</i>

67
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:26,149
I feel like I'm sitting
right next to you.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,786
Is it cold yet?

69
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:32,205
A little.
I wouldn't rush home.

70
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:34,992
Well, I want to get your brothers
before they go to sleep.

71
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:36,877
<i>I'll call you next week.</i>

72
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,879
I really want you
to sell that equipment.

73
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:40,547
You have no idea about money.

74
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:43,083
I will. Bye.

75
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,002
Bye, sweetheart.

76
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,484
Are you lost?

77
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,403
No, I'm a student here.

78
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,822
Well, see you around.

79
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:12,279
Oh!

80
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:13,914
Hey, give her some room.

81
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,783
You okay, lady?

82
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:19,953
Just my pride.
New shoes.

83
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:23,757
I think I need a minute.

84
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,348
Duck, how are you?

85
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:33,216
Fit as a fiddle, thank you.

86
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,555
28th?
That's top brass.

87
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,474
Actually, it's none
of your business.

88
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:43,860
Don't be coy. You're helping
them replace Don, aren't you?

89
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:47,064
I've done it before.

90
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:58,408
Is it true he left behind
a couple million bucks?

91
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,045
Nice to see you.

92
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:04,915
Actually, let me
ask you something.

93
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:06,917
Morning, John, Norm.

94
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,418
One month and you're
already the mayor.

95
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,003
They've been very hospitable.

96
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:11,722
Of course I delivered everyone.

97
00:06:11,757 --> 00:06:13,473
I even brought
Burger Chef back.

98
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,343
And after Joan cashed in,
I saved Avon.

99
00:06:16,395 --> 00:06:17,761
There have been whispers
about Coca-Cola.

100
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:20,097
No need to impress me.

101
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:21,815
What do you want?

102
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,433
Not here.

103
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:28,155
This will just
take a moment, Sarah.

104
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:32,109
You can't be in here.

105
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:34,277
Everyone's going to think
I'm looking for a job.

106
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,113
You mind?

107
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,282
They should always
think you're unhappy.

108
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:42,119
You're wrong. And for the
first time, they don't.

109
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:45,372
Now go outside and tell everyone you
staggered into the wrong office.

110
00:06:45,424 --> 00:06:48,291
- They'll believe you.
- Look, this isn't about you.

111
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:52,295
I've been trying to get this
private aviation company

112
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:53,797
to have me do all their hiring.

113
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,098
But before any of that happens,

114
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:57,134
they want to review
their overall strategy.

115
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:59,302
So I want you to go
to dinner and recommend

116
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:01,438
that they hire an in-house
senior marketing man.

117
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,106
And I'm the guy to find him.

118
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:04,558
Because you're the best?

119
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,976
Yes.

120
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:07,978
And then you can extoll
the wonders of McCann.

121
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,312
Everybody wins.

122
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:10,897
I don't need to poach.

123
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,483
You know, I helped you for
free after that stupid merger.

124
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:16,870
And then you sent Peggy to Gerald
what's-his-name when she was in need.

125
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,572
This is how I make
my living, Pete.

126
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:20,407
I've paid you at some point.

127
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,993
You'd want this business if you
knew you couldn't have it.

128
00:07:22,995 --> 00:07:25,796
Learjet is private,
luxury air travel.

129
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:33,336
Look, Pete, I just have
to fill this one position

130
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,338
and I'll make it
through the winter.

131
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,891
For old times' sake.

132
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:41,311
Fine. Who is he?

133
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:45,182
His name is Mike Sherman and he moved
to Wichita from Philly four years ago.

134
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:47,601
Princeton '52. You should
have a lot in common.

135
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,686
I'm Dartmouth '56.

136
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:51,354
I know that.

137
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:53,190
Don't pretend like you're not
gonna jack each other off.

138
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:56,993
- Sarah.
- Yes, Mr. Campbell?

139
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:59,996
Would you remind me that I need to
make a donation to Lincoln Center?

140
00:08:00,032 --> 00:08:01,781
Mr. Phillips
was very persuasive.

141
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,167
Thank you for your generosity.

142
00:08:10,425 --> 00:08:12,509
<i>KOMA, fun-loving 1520.</i>

143
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:13,960
<i>The capital radio...</i>

144
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:16,963
<i>...for the capital city,</i>
<i>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.</i>

145
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,970
Shit.

146
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:30,560
<i>Look for clear skies with
a high temperature today of 75.</i>

147
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:32,729
<i>A pleasant day</i>
<i>here in this pleasant city.</i>

148
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:34,364
<i>Current temperature is 73.</i>

149
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,066
<i>Beautiful weather</i>
<i>out there today.</i>

150
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,904
Dr. Buckley will be right
with you, Mrs. Robinson.

151
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:42,873
It's Mrs. Francis.

152
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:45,742
Oh, the boys who dropped you
off said that was your name.

153
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:48,461
I think that was a joke.

154
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:50,130
Oh.

155
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:52,048
Nurse, could you excuse us?

156
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:56,920
Mrs. Francis, is it possible
to get your husband down here?

157
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:58,838
I can drive with a broken rib.

158
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,423
It's not even that sore.

159
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:02,509
Well, I took a look
at your X-ray

160
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:05,262
and it may be more serious
than just the rib.

161
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,932
How serious?

162
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:12,519
You can use the phone
at the nurses' station.

163
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:23,914
I'm gonna sue them.

164
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,532
First I'm gonna go through
the Health Commission

165
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,284
and I'm gonna look
into their funding.

166
00:09:27,286 --> 00:09:30,253
That quack has some nerve
scaring you like that.

167
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:32,789
What happens to my car?

168
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,759
I'll send my secretary up here
in a cab tomorrow morning.

169
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:39,045
And I'm gonna call--
call-- call Jim.

170
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:40,964
Call--

171
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:42,632
You know what?

172
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:44,968
I'll just call Rocky's office.
That's what I'm gonna do.

173
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,470
Henry, I want to go home.

174
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:50,307
Babe, look at me.

175
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:54,277
You're gonna be just fine.

176
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:22,589
Afternoon.

177
00:10:22,641 --> 00:10:24,507
Wyatt called from
the service station.

178
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:26,643
We've got our best
available for you.

179
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:30,180
If you threw a rod,
it's gonna take some time.

180
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:32,148
It's the rocker arm.

181
00:10:32,184 --> 00:10:36,519
Well, I've got a weekly for
$37 or a daily for six.

182
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:38,238
Let's take it
a night at a time.

183
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:39,689
I'm an optimist.

184
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:42,859
Oh, hello.

185
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,661
This is my wife Sharon.

186
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:46,613
Of the Sharon Motel.

187
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:48,581
This is Donald from New York.

188
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:50,700
- Don.
- Pleasure to have you with us.

189
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:53,620
Do you know where
I could get a meal?

190
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:55,789
There's a cafe a couple
of miles up the road.

191
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,507
He's got car trouble.

192
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,093
Well, I made a roast.

193
00:11:00,128 --> 00:11:02,212
How'd you like leftovers
as room service?

194
00:11:02,264 --> 00:11:04,631
I don't want you
to go to the trouble.

195
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:06,132
Do you have vending machines?

196
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:07,801
You can have both.

197
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:10,887
Give him some change and
have Andy take his luggage.

198
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:12,305
This is all I got.

199
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:14,307
Here's two dimes and a nickel.

200
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,859
There you go.

201
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,201
I believe that's one of the
best steaks I've ever had.

202
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:28,071
Well, it's the best because
they flew it out from Kansas.

203
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:29,906
Isn't Wichita cattle country?

204
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,241
It sure is.

205
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:32,742
But I was disappointed
when I got there

206
00:11:32,744 --> 00:11:34,327
that I didn't see
more ten-gallon hats.

207
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,297
But your company is very glamorous.

208
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:41,384
As far as I can tell, its entire public
reputation is based on Hollywood.

209
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,887
Well, we thought we'd go with
our most exciting customers.

210
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:48,341
Elizabeth Taylor.
Danny Kaye.

211
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:50,343
Somebody you want to meet?

212
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:52,395
Not really.

213
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:54,814
In fact, I think that's the
problem if you have one.

214
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,933
I have one, or I wouldn't
be talking to you.

215
00:11:56,935 --> 00:12:00,070
Corporate executives should
be your core business.

216
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:02,572
You can read that
without glasses?

217
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:06,576
I've looked at your business
and I think Duck's right.

218
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:08,695
You need a senior
marketing executive.

219
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:10,163
And not just anyone.

220
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,781
You need someone comfortable

221
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:15,085
with the kind of boardroom leaders
that see Learjet as a tool,

222
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,121
not a frivolous extravagance for
movie stars and their pets.

223
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:21,791
McCann could run circles
around Carson Roberts.

224
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:23,293
But we wouldn't
even be interested

225
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:25,795
unless Duck found the right
man for your company.

226
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:29,099
I don't understand.

227
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:31,634
Are you advocating for
your agency or for yourself?

228
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,603
We're one and the same.

229
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:35,555
Well, the jobs are not
one and the same.

230
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,974
You can't work for McCann
and work for us.

231
00:12:40,145 --> 00:12:42,228
I'm aware of that.

232
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,448
But I couldn't agree with
you more about who we need.

233
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:48,284
I told Duck I was looking
for a real knickerbocker.

234
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,820
Right schools, right family.

235
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:52,822
Someone who can rap
his ring on the table

236
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:55,291
and let everyone know
they're with a friend.

237
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:57,710
Well, I'm flattered.

238
00:12:57,746 --> 00:13:00,797
But I'm afraid Duck Phillips has
tricked me into a job interview.

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,750
I stand by my analysis,

240
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:06,252
but I'm very happy where I am.

241
00:13:06,304 --> 00:13:08,588
I expect him to lie to me.

242
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,140
I didn't expect him
to lie to you.

243
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:11,641
I'm glad we got to meet.

244
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:14,010
Likewise.
That's never a mistake.

245
00:13:16,014 --> 00:13:17,480
You want a brandy?

246
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:18,932
Because Duck's going
to get the check.

247
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:26,189
<i>Well, unfortunately,
we've discovered</i>

248
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:28,274
<i>that the cancer has spread</i>
<i>from the lung</i>

249
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,944
<i>and metastasized to the bones</i>

250
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:33,413
<i>and to lymph nodes</i>
<i>in the mediastinum.</i>

251
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:35,949
<i>I don't understand
what you're saying.</i>

252
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:39,118
It's aggressive
and it's very advanced.

253
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:41,838
I wish there was better news.

254
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:43,957
What do we do?

255
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,543
Well, I'm going to recommend
a radiation oncologist

256
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:48,127
for therapy to help
mend the rib.

257
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,048
It won't heal without it.
Then a medical oncologist.

258
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,385
She could have
nine months to a year,

259
00:13:55,437 --> 00:13:58,771
but these treatments
are usually palliative.

260
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:02,141
I'm so sorry.

261
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:13,364
Oh, sorry about that.

262
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,033
You should put the sign out.

263
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:17,118
You're the maid?

264
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:19,203
And the messenger.

265
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,542
I guess they didn't know
you were in here.

266
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:27,128
Wyatt called. It's a
bushing on the rocker arm,

267
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,080
but it's got
to come from Tulsa.

268
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:31,716
So I'm gonna need another book.

269
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,635
The chlorine's killed
the piss in the pool by now.

270
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,003
You can go for a swim.

271
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:37,889
Anything else
to do around here?

272
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:42,143
There's football at the
high school Friday night.

273
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:44,846
Revival church every night.

274
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:46,431
Fairview's got
a drive-in,

275
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,016
but you don't have a car.

276
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:50,985
Where can I get a drink?

277
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:53,655
That's a little complicated.

278
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,274
But I probably can
rustle up a bottle.

279
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,162
That'd be great.

280
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:02,830
Andy.

281
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:04,115
You want me to clean up?

282
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,417
Don. Maybe tomorrow.

283
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:42,120
<i>There she is.</i>

284
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:44,155
<i>Don't run.</i>

285
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:00,922
I'm in Grand Central.
Come down.

286
00:16:00,974 --> 00:16:03,057
Only to throw you
under a train.

287
00:16:03,093 --> 00:16:04,976
Come on.

288
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:06,594
I only have one question.

289
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:08,613
I better have gotten
that lousy job.

290
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,515
You did, and it's not lousy.

291
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,984
I haven't even negotiated,
we're already at 100 a year.

292
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,154
All benefits and unlimited
private jet travel.

293
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:18,022
It's a flying limousine, Pete.

294
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:20,191
You can have lunch in New
York and be back for dinner.

295
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:22,693
Good, because I live here.
I have to go.

296
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,663
- He wants to have dinner with wives.
- No.

297
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:27,582
He's only meeting
with you and one other guy.

298
00:16:27,617 --> 00:16:29,200
Two last-round dinners.

299
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:30,952
Help me turn it
into a horse race.

300
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,788
How many times do you think
you can lie to this man?

301
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,591
We both told him you didn't want the job.
What's the lie?

302
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:39,710
Well, for one thing,
I don't have a wife.

303
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:42,547
For the other,
I have four years left

304
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,132
on my contract with McCann

305
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:47,018
and a million dollars
contingent on my presence.

306
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:50,772
Uh-huh, so now we know
there's a price.

307
00:16:50,807 --> 00:16:53,191
You're talking to yourself.

308
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:54,976
Have dinner.
Yuck it up.

309
00:16:55,028 --> 00:16:56,727
Don't you want
to sign him one day?

310
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:59,147
You know the corporate royalty
on those planes?

311
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,699
<i>7:30 Saturday.</i>

312
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:03,401
Grill Room at the Four Seasons.

313
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:05,736
Your wife's under the weather,
but you didn't want to miss it.

314
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,084
There's two guys. Hy Epstein wants
to start treatment immediately

315
00:17:20,136 --> 00:17:22,587
<i>and he's conducting a study</i>
<i>at New York Hospital.</i>

316
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,505
The other one--

317
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:26,340
can't read my own writing.

318
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:28,759
He's a surgeon.
Very aggressive.

319
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,261
But he's in Bethesda.

320
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:33,397
Stop brushing your hair.
How's the rib gonna heal?

321
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,149
My rib's not
going to heal, Henry.

322
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:37,935
You can't waste any more
time being in shock.

323
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:40,521
- You have to do something.
- Do what?

324
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:43,024
What do you think would happen
if Nelson Rockefeller got this?

325
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:44,775
He would die!

326
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:47,495
Betty, do you want the kids
to hear you talk that way?

327
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,115
I don't want them to hear anything
until I've decided what to tell them.

328
00:17:51,117 --> 00:17:53,117
That's what's
on my mind, Henry.

329
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:55,786
Do you want to help with that, or do
you want to keep chasing your tail?

330
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:57,371
You're being morose.

331
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,841
You're a very lucky woman.
You have been your whole life.

332
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:01,843
Stop yelling at me.

333
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,311
Thanks for the books.

334
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,315
It's $10.

335
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:26,150
I gave you $10.

336
00:18:26,152 --> 00:18:27,785
It was hard to get.

337
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:31,289
I'm not paying $20
for a bottle of whiskey

338
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:33,074
and a couple of paperbacks
somebody left behind.

339
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,792
You've got the money.

340
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:36,994
I walked into town.
And it's hard for me.

341
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,579
I got flatfeet.

342
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:56,314
- You want one?
- No, sir.

343
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:59,066
I'm one-eighth Comanche.
Can't ever touch it.

344
00:18:59,102 --> 00:19:01,852
Folks know the hustle you're
running out of their motel?

345
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,604
My folks are over in Woodward.

346
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:06,490
And ain't none of their
business how I get rich.

347
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:08,075
That's true.

348
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:11,412
How'd you get rich?

349
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:14,332
I was in
the advertising business.

350
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,450
You make commercials on TV?

351
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:17,702
Lots of them.

352
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,870
So many you don't
have to work no more?

353
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:21,455
Anymore.

354
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,759
All right.
Well, I'm around.

355
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:41,025
Don't forget to take
the pie Tammy made you.

356
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:27,817
Sorry to bother you,
but my TV just died.

357
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:29,940
Oh, well, we'll get
you a new one.

358
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:32,943
Soon as I'm done
fighting this battle.

359
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:50,544
There you go.

360
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:52,963
Then it comes loose.

361
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:11,782
You're the quick brown fox.

362
00:21:11,818 --> 00:21:13,367
Did you learn to type
in the army?

363
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:15,152
No, night school.

364
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:16,654
Were you in the service?

365
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:18,789
Yes.

366
00:21:18,825 --> 00:21:21,959
Well, everybody who's a vet
and likes drinking

367
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:23,744
will be at the Legion
on Saturday night.

368
00:21:23,796 --> 00:21:26,464
My husband would be tickled
if you joined him.

369
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:28,049
Why didn't he ask me?

370
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:31,419
Oh, he's gonna.
Soon as he spies a chance.

371
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:34,755
He could sure use someone new
to tell his stories to.

372
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,424
I don't know that I'll be here,

373
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:38,142
unless you know something
about my car that I don't.

374
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,679
Wyatt's gonna overcharge you,
but he'll get the work done.

375
00:21:41,731 --> 00:21:43,347
Let's get that TV

376
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:45,933
so you can get back
to relaxing.

377
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,408
Hello?

378
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:00,948
The whole pie is for you.

379
00:22:03,202 --> 00:22:04,452
Eat with me.

380
00:22:05,705 --> 00:22:07,254
There were two pies.

381
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,290
I'm not gonna tell you what
happened to the other one.

382
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:16,764
I have a favor to ask of you.

383
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,432
I can repay you.

384
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:21,051
I'll take her for a weekend next month.
You can go away.

385
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:22,853
What?

386
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:26,023
I have a dinner
with a potential client

387
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:27,441
and I'd love for you
to join me.

388
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:28,859
No.

389
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:31,445
Thankfully, that's no longer
one of my obligations.

390
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:33,114
You used to love it.

391
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:37,151
I daresay it got you excited
trying to close over coffee.

392
00:22:37,203 --> 00:22:38,869
I never closed anything.

393
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:40,571
I was just trying
to stay awake.

394
00:22:40,623 --> 00:22:44,241
Trudy, you understand
my business.

395
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:45,793
No one else ever really has.

396
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:49,630
Well, I'm not comfortable being
your date under any circumstances.

397
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:52,716
Well, then,

398
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:55,586
how about for old times' sake?

399
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:04,929
You know, I'm jealous
of your ability

400
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:07,681
to be sentimental
about the past.

401
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:09,567
I'm not able to do that.

402
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:11,852
I remember things as they were.

403
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:17,408
It's late.

404
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:19,243
I'd like to turn off
the lights.

405
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:25,082
Well, good night, then.

406
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:26,750
Good night.

407
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:37,704
Because she got kicked
out of Brearley.

408
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,540
Hold on. Easy.

409
00:23:40,626 --> 00:23:42,375
What are you doing here?

410
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:44,377
You're not supposed
to be in here.

411
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:46,213
Could you leave us
alone, sweetheart?

412
00:23:47,216 --> 00:23:49,216
Oh, of course.

413
00:23:52,604 --> 00:23:54,721
Come have a seat.

414
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:06,283
I have some serious news.

415
00:24:06,318 --> 00:24:08,068
It's bad news.

416
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:15,959
Your mother is sick.

417
00:24:15,994 --> 00:24:19,045
She has lung cancer
and it's very advanced.

418
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:22,966
I'm very sorry.

419
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,219
I've got to call her.

420
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:27,754
She doesn't want
you kids to know.

421
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:29,089
Then why are you telling me?

422
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:31,258
Because there's hope
she could have more time.

423
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,511
People do. It's a tough
road, but it's a chance.

424
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:37,013
Well, that's good.

425
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:39,099
But she won't do it.

426
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:41,268
I don't know if she's just
being stubborn or vain,

427
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,819
but she won't even hear of it.

428
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:45,405
Henry, my ears
are still buzzing.

429
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,607
I don't understand you.

430
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:50,243
I breached her confidence
because I want you

431
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:52,612
to talk some sense into her.

432
00:24:52,614 --> 00:24:54,614
She'll listen to you.

433
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:59,619
I wouldn't know what to say.

434
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:06,042
It's okay for you
to cry, honey.

435
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,627
Jesus, what am I going to do?

436
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:05,735
How's she running?

437
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:07,854
Good as new.

438
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:10,273
I suppose you're gonna
be on your way, then.

439
00:26:10,325 --> 00:26:11,441
I should settle up.

440
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:13,526
Sure I can't talk you
into joining us tonight?

441
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,946
I should get going.

442
00:26:15,998 --> 00:26:18,198
Mister, I know
you're not in a rush.

443
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,834
We got plenty of tourists
with cars in the shop.

444
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:23,670
You made two phone calls
in six days.

445
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:25,171
Wyatt thought you ran away.

446
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:27,424
I don't know.

447
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:29,376
Tell you what.

448
00:26:30,712 --> 00:26:32,345
I'll throw in the room tonight

449
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:35,015
and I'll give you another night
if you fix the Coke machine.

450
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,517
I don't think I can
help you with that.

451
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:39,719
I know you were right
about your car.

452
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:41,972
And Sharon said she
caught you being handy.

453
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:43,940
Don't they fix it?

454
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:46,109
They want to give me a new one,

455
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,561
but I like this one.
I'll get my tools.

456
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,325
<i>Hello?</i>

457
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:04,411
<i>Smells good.</i>

458
00:27:06,214 --> 00:27:08,298
I brought you a surprise.

459
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,014
Betty.

460
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:28,852
What are you doing here?

461
00:27:28,904 --> 00:27:30,937
I got in trouble
at school again.

462
00:27:32,274 --> 00:27:33,907
What'd you do?

463
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:35,859
I don't want to talk about it.

464
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:39,362
Are we supposed to eat?

465
00:27:39,414 --> 00:27:42,198
Genie, come over here.

466
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,559
So, I'm going to tell you
in advance

467
00:28:09,611 --> 00:28:12,362
that I know we seem
like fine people,

468
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:14,364
but I've been
a little dishonest.

469
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,899
Okay.

470
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:18,568
This is a fundraiser

471
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,986
for Al Bettendorf over there.

472
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:22,572
His house burned down.
Well, the kitchen.

473
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:25,208
The most expensive room.

474
00:28:25,243 --> 00:28:27,327
There's a fine jar.

475
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:36,252
We're just strangers,
but it does include barbecue

476
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:37,804
and I'm getting your drinks.

477
00:28:42,427 --> 00:28:44,511
$40 for Don!

478
00:28:47,315 --> 00:28:49,983
What's your rank
and where did you serve?

479
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:51,651
7th Infantry.
Korea.

480
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:53,186
Rank?

481
00:28:54,606 --> 00:28:55,905
Lieutenant.

482
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:58,741
Lieutenant,
7th Infantry, Korea.

483
00:28:58,777 --> 00:29:00,994
Shit, we should be paying him.

484
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:05,999
That's $5 for swearing.

485
00:29:07,002 --> 00:29:08,368
What are you drinking?

486
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,377
I'll just have
the shrimp cocktail.

487
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:21,297
Well, as Mother used to say,
"You're not that fat."

488
00:29:22,684 --> 00:29:25,351
No, I have a--
well, something came up.

489
00:29:25,387 --> 00:29:28,354
Since I invited you?

490
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,024
You're always complaining
we never see each other.

491
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:33,526
Then I ask you to dinner,
miss a very important meeting,

492
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:35,228
and you have other plans?

493
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,231
It was very short notice.

494
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:42,402
If you need an alibi,
you're going to have to ask.

495
00:29:42,404 --> 00:29:44,654
Please.

496
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,575
Now, what did you want
to talk about?

497
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:52,245
Let me ask you something.

498
00:29:52,297 --> 00:29:55,165
How do you know when something's
really an opportunity?

499
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:58,468
I'm wrong sometimes,

500
00:29:58,503 --> 00:30:00,720
but the girls
aren't shy nowadays.

501
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:03,973
No, I meant in your career.

502
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:08,178
Oh. Well, in banking there's a
road and you just stay on it.

503
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,647
Still, you're required
to assess risk.

504
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:12,599
Pete, I don't buy
or sell anything.

505
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:15,652
I just distribute
and it's never up to me.

506
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:18,821
Fine, forget your business.

507
00:30:18,857 --> 00:30:20,857
You're taking a risk tonight.

508
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:24,611
So now you're jealous and you're
trying to ruin my evening.

509
00:30:24,663 --> 00:30:26,446
Your wife knows.

510
00:30:26,498 --> 00:30:27,947
I'm not asking you
to imagine it,

511
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:29,449
I'm telling you she knows.

512
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:32,085
And how do you feel
now that you know that?

513
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,288
Judy's always loved that I was
attractive to other women.

514
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,873
It's part of what
she likes about me.

515
00:30:36,925 --> 00:30:38,374
I'm just supposed
to turn that off?

516
00:30:38,426 --> 00:30:40,376
You're not supposed
to act on it.

517
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:43,429
But I always have.
That's the way we are.

518
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:46,933
But why? Always looking
for something better.

519
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:49,185
Always looking
for something else.

520
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:51,387
Because Dad was like that.

521
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,641
He really was, wasn't he?

522
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,479
You know, once at
the polo grounds,

523
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:03,483
some jeweler thanked him profusely
for buying a diamond necklace.

524
00:31:03,535 --> 00:31:07,120
Dad got very cross and called off
the sale right in front of me.

525
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:10,907
He kept muttering
how the man was indiscreet.

526
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:13,126
I looked it up.

527
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,213
I didn't need
any detective work.

528
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:19,048
I just saw the way
women looked at him.

529
00:31:22,837 --> 00:31:24,671
You really think she knows?

530
00:31:24,673 --> 00:31:27,590
I think it feels good
and then it doesn't.

531
00:31:29,227 --> 00:31:31,811
I have to make a phone call.

532
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,730
Don't listen to me.

533
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:35,982
I'll be right back.

534
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,715
And Wayne's dad ran
the drugstore before Wayne.

535
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,301
He was all 10 Commandments
rolled into one.

536
00:31:47,554 --> 00:31:51,940
He caught us smoking,
stealing, cussing.

537
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:54,109
My wife went to high
school with these two.

538
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:55,777
They were hooligans.

539
00:31:55,812 --> 00:31:59,314
I didn't break the real
Commandments till I was in Europe.

540
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,533
Were you in Europe, Don?

541
00:32:01,568 --> 00:32:03,618
Don was in Korea.

542
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:06,821
You don't just need new glasses,
you need a new hearing aid.

543
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:09,708
Well, he hasn't said anything.

544
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:11,793
Did you
introduce him to--

545
00:32:11,828 --> 00:32:14,913
Hey, Jerry!
Jerry Fandango!

546
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:16,081
Get over here.

547
00:32:17,668 --> 00:32:19,751
Jerry served in Korea.

548
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:22,504
So, you know, maybe
you've seen him before.

549
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:24,339
What the fuck
do you farts want?

550
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:28,009
- Gerald Fanning, this is--
- Don was in Korea.

551
00:32:28,011 --> 00:32:30,512
You two can reminisce.

552
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:33,148
I don't want to talk about it.

553
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:36,568
Jerry Fanning.
PFC, 34th Infantry.

554
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:38,687
Come on, let me see your face.

555
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,826
When and where?

556
00:32:44,861 --> 00:32:47,662
It was before they called it a war.
Near the Yalu River.

557
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:49,781
Oh, hell.

558
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:53,284
I wasn't there
till Christmas '53.

559
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,705
I was home by then.

560
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:58,957
Have a seat.

561
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,592
No, I got one.

562
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,794
Tell you one thing about Korea.

563
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:04,546
They can keep it.

564
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:08,977
Go away.

565
00:34:09,029 --> 00:34:10,478
<i>What the hell happened to you?</i>

566
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,196
<i>You stood me up.</i>

567
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:15,483
Get in here.

568
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:19,287
I never said I would go.

569
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:22,573
You did, and Mike was waiting
with Charlene at the Grill Room

570
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:24,292
for an hour!

571
00:34:24,327 --> 00:34:26,661
For heaven's sake,
you're drunk.

572
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:29,547
And you're being
very menacing right now.

573
00:34:29,582 --> 00:34:31,916
I'm happy.
Listen to me.

574
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:33,251
You're on a streak.

575
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:35,053
You're on one
of those magic--

576
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:36,838
we used to call it a trend.

577
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,891
You know, because of the graph
where the line just goes up.

578
00:34:39,926 --> 00:34:42,393
I don't know what
you're talking about.

579
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:44,846
Mike called me
from his hotel room.

580
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:46,230
He was pretty sore.

581
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:47,849
So I told him that
you wanted to come,

582
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,600
but you were insulted
by the offer.

583
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:51,686
- You what?
- He wants to do it all.

584
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:54,155
Company car, company
plane, signing bonus.

585
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,490
And he's gonna get you
out of McCann.

586
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:57,275
He's gonna give me
a million dollars?

587
00:34:57,327 --> 00:34:59,327
He's gonna get very close
with stock options

588
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:01,029
and McCann's gonna
cut a deal for the rest

589
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,747
because you're gonna help them.

590
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:05,249
Learjet's a tiny account.
It's peanuts to them.

591
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:07,585
You're not the client.
Your passengers are.

592
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,672
Jim Hobart's very excited about
who flies on those planes.

593
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,957
Every important CEO in America.

594
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,926
You talked to Jim Hobart?

595
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:16,878
You know what $100
buys you in Wichita?

596
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,379
A two-bedroom house.

597
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:19,797
You stupid wino.

598
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:22,433
You're going to
destroy everything!

599
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:24,552
Who's going to win
the World Series this year?

600
00:35:24,604 --> 00:35:26,104
I don't know.

601
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:28,056
You are!

602
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:29,891
Because you are charmed,
my friend.

603
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,693
Good night, Duck.

604
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:36,948
I've been there.
It doesn't last long.

605
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:49,077
So the doctor says,
"Sorry, son,

606
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,329
but your pecker's got gangrene.

607
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:53,047
We're gonna have
to amputate."

608
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:56,467
So the GI goes
to the Jap doctor.

609
00:35:56,503 --> 00:36:00,138
"Oh, good news.
No need to amputate.

610
00:36:00,173 --> 00:36:02,807
In three days will
fall off by itself."

611
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:08,730
To Don!

612
00:36:08,765 --> 00:36:12,350
For being generous
and not saying shit.

613
00:36:12,402 --> 00:36:14,819
I don't know that many jokes.

614
00:36:14,854 --> 00:36:16,521
Oh, just leave him alone.

615
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:18,406
Don, you're not allowed to say,

616
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:20,825
"I don't want to talk
about it" in this place.

617
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,443
That's why I never joined.

618
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:24,912
You're not listening to me.

619
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:28,116
You're among friends.

620
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:30,251
Floyd, tell him.

621
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:34,756
- Floyd!
- What?

622
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,341
Tell him about
the Hurtgen Forest.

623
00:36:38,795 --> 00:36:40,711
Give me a drink.

624
00:36:40,764 --> 00:36:42,263
Tell him the story first.

625
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:45,099
Oh, shit.

626
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:50,772
You know where it is?

627
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:55,810
It's on the border
between Belgium and Germany.

628
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:06,204
We were cut off.

629
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,239
Three of us.

630
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:11,659
Actually...

631
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:14,078
there were nine of us
originally.

632
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:21,085
We came on a machine gun nest.

633
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:26,891
There were four Krauts in
there looking to surrender.

634
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:30,595
They had their hands in the
air with their papers.

635
00:37:30,647 --> 00:37:33,848
They were starving.
Don't skip that.

636
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,818
We were starving.

637
00:37:36,853 --> 00:37:39,020
Scrounging for grub.

638
00:37:39,022 --> 00:37:41,489
We were boiling bark.

639
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:48,029
So there's three of us,

640
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:50,498
four of them,

641
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,500
and more snow coming.

642
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,372
You did what you had to do.

643
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:03,294
What did you do?

644
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:09,100
Someone made them
start digging.

645
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:11,886
And we bounced them.

646
00:38:11,938 --> 00:38:13,938
One at a time.

647
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:19,360
Took a couple of hours.

648
00:38:19,395 --> 00:38:22,146
One of them was so skinny,
he tried to run away,

649
00:38:22,198 --> 00:38:24,398
his pants fell down.

650
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:30,538
You know they all
got blue eyes.

651
00:38:35,578 --> 00:38:38,412
You just do what you
have to do to come home.

652
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:45,753
I killed my CO.

653
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:55,346
We were under fire.

654
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,317
Fuel was everywhere.

655
00:39:01,437 --> 00:39:03,854
And I dropped my lighter.

656
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:08,442
And I blew him apart.

657
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,083
And I got to go home.

658
00:39:20,206 --> 00:39:24,592
That is the name of the game.

659
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:31,265
Hey, where is that kid?

660
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:33,134
We need a bottle over here!

661
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:35,019
Over here!

662
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:37,972
Over here!

663
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:41,359
♪ Get that kid
with the booze over here... ♪

664

672
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:18,229
- Did I wake you?
- No.

673
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:31,158
Henry shouldn't
have scared you.

674
00:40:31,194 --> 00:40:33,995
I wanted to tell you myself.

675
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,447
He doesn't know
you won't get treatment

676
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:38,416
because you love the tragedy.

677
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:40,618
Sally, I've learned

678
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,170
to believe people when
they tell you it's over.

679
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:47,124
They don't want to say it,
so it's usually the truth.

680
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:49,377
Henry said you could
have a year.

681
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:51,462
And what would
that year be like?

682
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:53,381
I'll be with you.

683
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:55,049
I won't let you give up.

684
00:40:56,302 --> 00:40:58,102
I know that.

685
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:02,306
But I watched my mother die.

686
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:04,275
I won't do that to you.

687
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:08,396
And I don't want you
to think I'm a quitter.

688
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:11,232
I fought for plenty in my life.

689
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:14,201
That's how I know
when it's over.

690
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:16,487
It's not a weakness.

691
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:18,205
It's been a gift to me.

692
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:22,743
To know when to move on.

693
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:31,919
These are instructions.

694
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:34,004
Open it the minute
you know I'm gone.

695
00:41:36,059 --> 00:41:38,426
- No.
- Listen to me.

696
00:41:38,478 --> 00:41:41,095
Things happen very quickly
when people die.

697
00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:44,148
Henry's not going to
be able to handle things.

698
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:51,522
You're going back
to school in the morning.

699
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:53,741
I don't want you
alarming your brothers.

700
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,366
Go back to sleep.

701
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:21,852
What the hell?

702
00:42:21,888 --> 00:42:23,437
We want our money.

703
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:24,855
What?

704
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:26,190
We know you took the money.

705
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:29,777
Let me go!
Sharon, what's going on?

706
00:42:29,812 --> 00:42:32,480
Your car was fixed. You
should have been on your way.

707
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:36,817
Now, I don't know
who the hell you are,

708
00:42:36,819 --> 00:42:39,954
but you've got five Mississippi
to get our money back.

709
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:41,956
I didn't take your money.

710
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:44,458
You threw all that money around

711
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:45,993
'cause you knew
you'd get it back.

712
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:53,918
I mean business!

713
00:42:55,254 --> 00:42:57,588
You really think I need
your spare change?

714
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:13,270
Give us the cash and you
can have your car back.

715
00:43:13,322 --> 00:43:16,740
- Probably stolen.
- We'll find out.

716
00:43:40,832 --> 00:43:42,631
My God, what's wrong?

717
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:44,416
I need to speak with you.

718
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:45,918
My goodness,
it's 4:00 in the morning.

719
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,503
Is everything all right?

720
00:43:53,227 --> 00:43:55,344
You're scaring me.
Please, what is it?

721
00:43:55,396 --> 00:43:57,596
It's good news.
Catch your breath.

722
00:43:57,648 --> 00:44:01,233
What on earth is going on?

723
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:03,936
I was offered a job tonight.

724
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:06,105
Because its origins
were supernatural,

725
00:44:06,157 --> 00:44:08,774
I realized that its
benefits might be as well.

726
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,945
I want you and Tammy
to come with me.

727
00:44:12,947 --> 00:44:16,282
I want you to relocate to
Wichita, pick out a house,

728
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:19,118
and be my wife
and family again.

729
00:44:21,122 --> 00:44:24,707
Peter, I'm not
dismissing you...

730
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,127
I'm saying with
respect to whatever

731
00:44:28,129 --> 00:44:30,296
is happening in
your eyes right now,

732
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:33,048
we both know things
can't be undone.

733
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,184
Says who?

734
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:37,770
We're not even through
half our lives.

735
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:41,557
And even if we are,
we're entitled to more.

736
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:43,309
Of what?

737
00:44:44,812 --> 00:44:47,112
Then we're entitled
to something new.

738
00:44:49,483 --> 00:44:51,233
I want to start over.

739
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,154
And I know I can.

740
00:44:56,324 --> 00:44:58,123
I'm not so dumb anymore.

741
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:01,126
I'm not ignoring the fact that I
could actually lose your love.

742
00:45:02,914 --> 00:45:04,880
You never lost it.

743
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,800
But I will never allow you
to hurt me again.

744
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:11,637
I love you, too.

745
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,507
I always have.

746
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:18,143
I've never loved anyone else.

747
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:19,845
Never.

748
00:45:25,736 --> 00:45:28,270
You think you can come in here

749
00:45:28,322 --> 00:45:30,189
when I'm all disoriented

750
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:33,025
and say the things I wanted you
to say to me two years ago

751
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:34,827
and make me run away with you?

752
00:45:34,862 --> 00:45:38,447
I said it to you 10 years
ago and I'll say it again.

753
00:45:38,499 --> 00:45:40,115
I do.

754
00:45:44,038 --> 00:45:46,205
Wichita is beautiful.

755
00:45:46,207 --> 00:45:48,340
And wholesome.

756
00:45:48,376 --> 00:45:51,210
And not the city
and not Cos Cob.

757
00:45:51,262 --> 00:45:53,595
And you'll have a plane
to use at your disposal.

758
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:54,847
We will.

759
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:58,550
To pick up and go anywhere
anytime we want.

760
00:45:58,552 --> 00:46:01,387
Like driving to Montauk.

761
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:03,856
I want to go
everywhere with you.

762
00:46:09,447 --> 00:46:12,448
Say yes with your voice,
not just your eyes.

763
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:16,235
Oh!

764
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:36,422
How will I explain
this to Tammy?

765
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:42,177
Tell her her birthday
wish came true.

766
00:46:48,602 --> 00:46:51,020
I'm gonna go.

767
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:53,939
And we're gonna have
dinner on Saturday night.

768
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:55,858
The three of us.

769
00:46:56,944 --> 00:46:58,861
Like it was the first time.

770
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:17,546
Good morning.

771
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:47,159
This one's on the house.

772
00:47:49,997 --> 00:47:52,581
What do you want to know?
You want to know what I told them?

773
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:54,416
I'm just being
a good citizen, man.

774
00:47:54,468 --> 00:47:57,169
You don't know anything about me.
I could kill you right now.

775
00:47:57,171 --> 00:47:58,971
You took that money
and you set me up.

776
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:02,224
I don't know what
you're talking about.

777
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:04,176
You have shitty instincts
for a con man.

778
00:48:05,646 --> 00:48:07,346
You're lucky you feel guilty.

779
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:08,931
That's the one difference between
you and those animals right now.

780
00:48:08,983 --> 00:48:11,517
I don't feel guilty
taking that drunk's money.

781
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:13,185
He burned his own house down.

782
00:48:13,187 --> 00:48:15,821
He doesn't deserve a pot to
piss in, let alone 500 bucks.

783
00:48:15,856 --> 00:48:17,322
You're gonna get me that money,

784
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:19,108
pack your bag,
and get out of town.

785
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,860
I can't leave
without that money.

786
00:48:21,862 --> 00:48:24,413
I know you think
you know how to hustle,

787
00:48:24,448 --> 00:48:27,533
but this is a big crime,
stealing these people's money.

788
00:48:27,535 --> 00:48:30,953
If you keep it, you'll have
to become somebody else.

789
00:48:31,005 --> 00:48:33,288
And it's not
what you think it is.

790
00:48:35,342 --> 00:48:38,260
You cannot get off
on that foot in this life.

791
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:40,095
What do you care?

792
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:42,381
You got money.
I know you got money.

793
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,850
I cleaned your room
and didn't take nothing.

794
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:46,051
Anything.

795
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:47,553
You think this town is bad now?

796
00:48:47,555 --> 00:48:49,471
Wait until you can
never come back.

797
00:48:49,523 --> 00:48:51,306
Can I go?

798
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:53,225
Go get the money.

799
00:49:25,893 --> 00:49:27,759
I'm not paying for the room.

800
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:40,606
Could you drop me off
at the bus stop?

801
00:49:44,828 --> 00:49:46,111
Get in.

802
00:49:59,627 --> 00:50:01,677
I'm off.

803
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:04,046
- Where are you going?
- I have class.

804
00:50:05,382 --> 00:50:07,015
Why are you doing that?

805
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:09,935
Why was I ever doing it?

806
00:50:30,374 --> 00:50:31,990
<i>"Dear Sally,</i>

807
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,792
<i>I know that you're frightened</i>

808
00:50:33,827 --> 00:50:36,912
<i>and there are many decisions</i>
<i>I can't prepare you for,</i>

809
00:50:36,964 --> 00:50:38,964
<i>but you must immediately</i>
<i>tell the hospital</i>

810
00:50:38,999 --> 00:50:42,000
<i>and the funeral director</i>
<i>that I'm to be interred intact</i>

811
00:50:42,002 --> 00:50:44,469
<i>in the family plot</i>
<i>in West Laurel.</i>

812
00:50:44,505 --> 00:50:48,056
<i>Uncle William has the details</i>
<i>from Grandpa Gene's burial.</i>

813
00:50:49,226 --> 00:50:50,676
<i>I've also enclosed a portrait</i>

814
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:53,562
<i>from the 1968 Republican</i>
<i>Winter Gala.</i>

815
00:50:53,597 --> 00:50:56,848
<i>The blue chiffon I wore</i>
<i>is my very favorite.</i>

816
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:00,769
<i>I hung it in a gold garment bag in
the hall closet beside the mink.</i>

817
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:04,740
<i>Please bring them the lipstick</i>
<i>from my handbag</i>

818
00:51:04,775 --> 00:51:07,159
<i>and remind them</i>
<i>how I like to wear my hair.</i>

819
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,529
<i>Will you show them the picture?</i>

820
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:15,367
<i>Sally, I always</i>
<i>worried about you</i>

821
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:18,503
<i>because you march</i>
<i>to the beat of your own drum.</i>

822
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:22,007
<i>But now I know that's good.</i>

823
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:24,543
<i>I know your life</i>
<i>will be an adventure."</i>

824
00:51:27,715 --> 00:51:30,382
<i>"I love you. Mom."</i>

825
00:52:02,082 --> 00:52:03,915
Pink slip's in the glove box.

826
00:52:05,419 --> 00:52:06,885
What?

827
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,221
Don't waste this.
