3
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,654
I've never worn mink before.

4
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,239
It's chinchilla.

5
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:00,441
And it costs $15,000.

6
00:01:00,443 --> 00:01:02,443
How does that make you feel?

7
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:04,278
Nervous.

8
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,030
You're not supposed to talk.

9
00:01:07,617 --> 00:01:09,500
Show me how you feel.

10
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,207
Walk over to the mirror.

11
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,879
Look at yourself.

12
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,932
<i>You like what you see.</i>

13
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,436
Don't open the whole coat.

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,441
Just try and make it look like

15
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:35,810
you're just wearing the fur.

16
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:48,990
Very good.

17
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,661
Now, I want you
to close your eyes

18
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,914
<i>and take a deep breath.</i>

19
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:59,500
<i>And when I tell you,</i>
<i>you're gonna put your leg</i>

20
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:01,919
<i>up on that chair,</i>

21
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:04,756
<i>let the coat slide down,</i>

22
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:07,642
and show me how smooth
your skin is.

23
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,154
<i>I remember
when I was a little girl</i>

24
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,323
<i>our house caught on fire.</i>

25
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:25,159
<i>I'll never forget the look</i>
<i>on my father's face</i>

26
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,195
<i>as he gathered me up</i>
<i>in his arms</i>

27
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:31,499
<i>and raced through the burning
building onto the pavement.</i>

28
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:35,203
<i>And I stood there</i>
<i>shivering in my pajamas</i>

29
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:38,289
<i>and watched the whole world</i>
<i>go up in flames.</i>

30
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,043
<i>And when it was all over,</i>
<i>I said to myself,</i>

31
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:45,546
<i>"Is that all there is</i>
<i>to a fire?"</i>

32
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:50,718
<i>Is that all there is?</i>

33
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:57,058
<i>♪ Is that all there is? ♪</i>

34
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:01,279
<i>♪ If that's all there is,</i>
<i>my friends ♪</i>

35
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:06,367
<i>♪ then let's</i>
<i>keep dancing... ♪</i>

36
00:03:06,402 --> 00:03:08,569
Very good, Cindy.

37
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,738
Thank you very much, Cindy.

38
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,657
We'll let you know.

39
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:18,212
<i>♪ If that's all ♪</i>

40
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,383
<i>♪ there is... ♪</i>

41
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:23,885
<i>So, what happened?</i>

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,888
Well, no woman, even
living in that shithole,

43
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,973
wants a toaster
for her birthday.

44
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,008
- Can you freshen this?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,978
And Abigail wasn't shy.

46
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,013
- That's your mother?
- Stepmother.

47
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:39,400
So she put the toaster
in the middle of the table

48
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:42,270
and all the boarders come
down for breakfast, see it.

49
00:03:42,272 --> 00:03:44,405
They weren't
particularly impressed.

50
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,108
And every day one of them
would trip over that wire

51
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,443
and yank it off the table.

52
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,028
Don't go back there.
A lot of roaches.

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,447
- Are you surprised?
- Only by the size.

54
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:54,949
There was one
making a phone call.

55
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:57,418
Get up, I want my seat back.

56
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:03,507
Now, toasters were
indestructible back then,

57
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,293
except for the cord,

58
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:08,012
which was suffering from being yanked
out of the wall every morning.

59
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:11,015
My Uncle Mack was cheap and
thought he could fix things.

60
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,385
So he wrapped a piece
of copper wire around it.

61
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:16,470
And, sure enough,
he plugged it in

62
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,522
and it blew him
into the parlor.

63
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,475
He was unconscious.

64
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:24,111
All the boarders got up,
ran to his aid,

65
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:25,646
but Abigail didn't move.

66
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,899
She just looked down
at him and said,

67
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,984
"Happy birthday."

68
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,986
Then put the kettle on.

69
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,956
He loves to tell stories
about how poor he was.

70
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,407
But he's not anymore.

71
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:38,242
Is that your way of saying you
want me to get the check?

72
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,544
Hey, Mildred Pierce,
can I get the check?

73
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:44,165
- Come on.
- Be polite.

74
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,050
Oh.

75
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,802
Can I get you something else?

76
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:51,138
No, just the check. And do you
have anything by John Dos Passos?

77
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,810
I'm sorry about my friend.
He's...

78
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:57,061
Witty.

79
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,063
Do I know you?

80
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,315
I don't think so.

81
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,320
She's a little old for NYU.

82
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,190
$11.60.

83
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,158
You must have had a lot
of hash browns, sweetheart.

84
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,526
Probably only eats once a week.

85
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,028
Let's split it five ways.

86
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,865
No, I think I owe
someone an apology.

87
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,500
That ought to do it.

88
00:05:20,536 --> 00:05:22,670
That's $100.

89
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,373
Well, I suppose I'm gonna
have to drop one of you off.

90
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,124
You decide who.

91
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,140
Don.
Let's go.

92
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:00,708
<i>Good evening, Mr. Draper.</i>

93
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:02,576
- Who am I speaking with?
- <i> It's Joanne.</i>

94
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,579
<i>You have four messages.</i>
<i>At 7:30, Laura called</i>

95
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,298
<i>and said she has a photo shoot</i>
<i>in the morning,</i>

96
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>so don't call</i>
<i>after 11:00.</i>

97
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:10,885
- What time is it?
- <i> It's 10 past,</i>

98
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,838
<i>but she called again at 8:00</i>
<i>and said midnight was fine.</i>

99
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,424
What else?

100
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:18,509
<i>9:30, Maxine called.</i>

101
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:20,644
<i>She met you two weeks ago</i>
<i>at "Cosmopolitan"</i>

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,481
<i>and remains intrigued</i>
<i>by your proposition.</i>

103
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,434
<i>And last, at 10:00,</i>
<i>Tricia from TWA.</i>

104
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,935
<i>She's on a layover.</i>

105
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,487
And what are you
doing tonight, Joanne?

106
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,272
<i>You're very funny,</i>
<i>Mr. Draper.</i>

107
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:35,159
Give me Tricia's number.

108
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,164
So glad you could make it.

109
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,665
O'Hare's a mess.

110
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,201
They canceled everything,
so it seemed to be fate.

111
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,838
You look ravishing.

112
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,291
I feel a little underdressed.

113
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:51,842
Where were you tonight?

114
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,437
No, it's true. On every single flight,

115
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:07,224
there's always one blanket that's
completely soaked in urine.

116
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:10,027
- In first class?
- Oh, yes.

117
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:15,649
Oh! I'm sorry.

118
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,319
It's your fault.
You scared me.

119
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,037
Do you have a towel?

120
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,994
Don't do that.

121
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,342
Another woman
you're sleeping with?

122
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,929
No, that's the woman
I'm not sleeping with.

123
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,847
My ex-wife.

124
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,737
Hanes calls them L'eggs.

125
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,241
They're crap.

126
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,827
They're definitely not
as high-quality as Topaz.

127
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,612
Well, they're in
four test markets

128
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:04,365
and they're outspending
you six to one.

129
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,450
And they're outselling
you 20 to one.

130
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:09,203
It's more than the packaging.
It's the placement.

131
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:10,871
They're not just selling
them in drug stores.

132
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,706
They're focusing
on supermarkets.

133
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,758
And they're only
$1.39 a pair.

134
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,678
So what, we need to lower our price
and buy more ad time?

135
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:21,098
This is only a novelty and the inferior
quality will catch up with them.

136
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,267
But we're recommending
a change right now

137
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,186
while it sorts itself out.

138
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,438
Look, I know
you think I'm cheap.

139
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,390
And I know you think
Topaz are cheap--

140
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,309
although, apparently,
not cheap enough--

141
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:36,313
but I just want to spend money
where it'll make a difference.

142
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:39,733
They got an egg.
Why don't we have a topaz?

143
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,819
Big plastic jewel.
Green.

144
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,287
Maybe it's see-through.

145
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:45,072
And Mr. Potato Head
here can relax

146
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,908
'cause he'll still make his
quota when we launch it.

147
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,245
I'd never recommend
imitation as a strategy.

148
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:54,298
You'll be second,
which is very far from first.

149
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,749
Whose fault is that?

150
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,886
I told you about the
development of this product

151
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,721
and you didn't seem
worried at all.

152
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,477
Art, Marvin,
are you ready for lunch?

153
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,596
Yes, I am, Kenneth.

154
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,732
We had a problem,
but we solved it.

155
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,438
Well, that's great to hear.

156
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:21,609
What do we do?

157
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:23,744
We keep the client.

158
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,531
How was the party?

159
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,783
David Bailey wants
to take your picture.

160
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,620
Well, I have plans tonight,

161
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:35,623
so I'll be leaving at 5:00 on the dot
and I don't want to hear about it.

162
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:39,426
- Wake me in--
- You have casting in an hour.

163
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:40,928
Great.

164
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:51,639
You have lunch plans?

165
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:54,108
Just coffee
if the wait's not too long.

166
00:09:58,614 --> 00:10:01,815
No, I just thought I'm going
to the coffee shop,

167
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,701
so I could pick
you up something.

168
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,569
Mathis, you're pouring coffee.

169
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:07,821
I just wanted to ask you
about something.

170
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:10,124
You want a raise?
Stop acting like a secretary.

171
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,326
This has nothing
to do with work.

172
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:14,328
My brother-in-law
is in town

173
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,132
and I thought you could
join Julie and I for dinner.

174
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:21,502
He's very handsome.
The whole family is.

175
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,588
- You're setting me up?
- He has a car.

176
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,475
It's very sweet, but I really have to
question your judgment.

177
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,594
You know, you're a catch.

178
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:34,682
Thank you, but how could you think
this has nothing to do with work?

179
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:37,685
I told my wife that and she
said it wouldn't matter

180
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:39,320
because she has
a knack for this.

181
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,356
What happens if I take
you up on this offer

182
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,326
and it goes badly
or he's homely

183
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,611
or anything happens
good or bad?

184
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:49,113
Did you think about that?

185
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:52,082
No, I didn't anticipate
any of this,

186
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,200
I'll be honest with you.

187
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,670
I appreciate it,
but no, thank you.

188
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,505
Tell Julie
she's very thoughtful.

189
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,966
Are you auditioning?

190
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:10,884
I tried to arrange a meeting,

191
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,721
but Meredith explained
how much work you have to do.

192
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:21,145
We met with Topaz and had the
unpleasant conversation.

193
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:25,532
And their solution was a
knockoff topaz container, green.

194
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:28,068
What was our solution?

195
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,455
We don't have one.

196
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,541
The irony is they're being pushed
out of the bottom of the market.

197
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,377
What's the top of the market,
department stores?

198
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:38,078
Yeah, but they're
a drug store brand.

199
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,546
That's what Topaz is.

200
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,668
So they're not called
Topaz anymore.

201
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,304
Tell them their idea
for new packaging was good,

202
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,506
but the new packaging
should say Macy's.

203
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:51,725
That's going to be tough
when department stores

204
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,428
are being blown up by radicals every day.
You know these two.

205
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,230
People haven't
stopped shopping.

206
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,565
So all I have to do
is sign Macy's.

207
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,933
Piece of cake.

208
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,771
Doesn't McCann represent
Marshall Field's?

209
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,191
Remind them
it's a two-way street.

210
00:12:11,914 --> 00:12:13,947
Phil was in plastics
and he's going to metals.

211
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,033
And Greg was in metals
and he's going to

212
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:18,085
marketing and advertising,
which is my old job.

213
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,037
That means that Tom Schaeffer

214
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,873
is now head of plastics
at Dow Chemical.

215
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,591
Good for him.

216
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:26,293
Good for you.

217
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,213
Now's a good time.

218
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:31,215
He's still not up.

219
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,433
Oh.

220
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,101
Never wake a sleeping baby.

221
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:35,636
I want to see him.

222
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,057
Oh, what's that?

223
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:42,309
We don't want you to think
of this as retirement,

224
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:45,229
we want you to think of it as the
beginning of your professional career.

225
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:47,614
I don't know what to say.

226
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,783
You say, "Jack Nicklaus,
out of my way.

227
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,318
I've got better clubs."

228
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,487
I'm very touched.

229
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,323
Ever since your mother
passed away,

230
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:59,243
I haven't really
enjoyed anything.

231
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:02,246
Honestly, Ed.
He thinks he's a comedian.

232
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,165
I'm just glad there's something

233
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:07,000
that will get him out of the
house besides that boat.

234
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,669
Who says I'm going
to be in the house?

235
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,587
I've got a lot of time
to make up for.

236
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,006
Daddy, I'm so glad.

237
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:15,642
I mean, most of the men my age have
had a couple of heart attacks.

238
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:17,845
I'm still young enough
to enjoy things.

239
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:19,480
New things, even.

240
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,348
I've started cooking.

241
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:24,318
Actually made myself a--
what is it, honey?

242
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,520
A Pop-Tart, Ed.

243
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:28,522
It was very good.

244
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:34,077
Next.

245
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,113
This is another girl.

246
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:48,509
Rachel?

247
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,480
I'm supposed to tell you
you missed your flight.

248
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,982
Thank you.

249
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:17,905
Rachel.

250
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,491
Yes?

251
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:23,327
You're not just smooth,

252
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:26,246
you're Wilkinson smooth.

253
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,668
Back to work.

254
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:42,396
Is it morning?

255
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:47,985
No.

256
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,903
Go back to sleep.

257
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:02,783
Sorry, did I wake you?

258
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,452
It's okay.
Did Eddie wake up again?

259
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,927
My dad is so old.

260
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,130
Don't worry about him.

261
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:18,849
He is going to have a ball.

262
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,885
Why did he wait
so long to do that?

263
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:24,021
Honey, he loved his job.

264
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,473
But you don't.

265
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,643
You're bored and angry because
you know in your heart

266
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,111
it's not what you want to do.

267
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,896
I should never
tell you anything.

268
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:35,616
And I haven't gotten any
writing done in a long time.

269
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:37,951
So start now.

270
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,820
You've done very well.

271
00:15:39,822 --> 00:15:43,156
And let's stop pretending like
I wasn't born with plenty.

272
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,158
You could quit your job.

273
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,160
We could buy that farm.

274
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,496
You could write your book.

275
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:51,048
What book?

276
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,835
Something sad and sweet.

277
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,921
For all the people who don't have
the guts to live their dream.

278
00:15:57,973 --> 00:15:59,590
Why don't you write a book?

279
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:02,593
You gave them your eye.

280
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:04,344
Don't give them
the rest of your life.

281
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:07,264
Your father was a cog
in a giant machine

282
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:08,815
that makes weapons and poison.

283
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:11,852
And you sell them.

284
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:13,820
I'm proud of the company!

285
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:17,608
And if nothing else, I'd like to
wait and see if I get that raise.

286
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,694
There's always another hurdle.

287
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:22,863
You're not listening
to me at all!

288
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:30,754
- You're late.
- It's five after.

289
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,373
Casting always starts on time.

290
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,175
Can't you smell
the cheap perfume?

291
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:40,130
Can you call Rachel Katz
at Menken's Department Store?

292
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:42,049
No, you know what?
Set a meeting.

293
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:43,266
The number's in the Rolodex.

294
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,601
It's regarding Topaz Pantyhose.

295
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:46,470
Of course.

296
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,776
Well, you're not the
landing party we expected.

297
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,113
What can we do for you?

298
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,116
Well, as I was telling
David here on the phone,

299
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,902
L'eggs Pantyhose
is an unstoppable foe

300
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:04,488
in the affordable
pantyhose marketplace.

301
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,624
Our client, Topaz Pantyhose,
has the high quality

302
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,743
to wear
a department store name.

303
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:15,549
It is a growing
and lucrative product.

304
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,968
And in three months,
L'eggs has sold a year's worth.

305
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,471
So they're worried that L'eggs are
gonna spread all over the world?

306
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,223
That wouldn't bother me at all.

307
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:27,394
We were hoping
that McCann-Erickson

308
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,147
could provide, at the minimum,
an introduction

309
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:32,099
to your department
store clients

310
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,901
so we can assess their
desire for a store brand.

311
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,820
I know they'd be
happy to meet you.

312
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,740
Especially Dan Higgins.
He loves redheads.

313
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,442
Would you be able to tell him

314
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,861
what's so special
about your panties?

315
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:47,948
The benefits are listed there.

316
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,200
But, basically,
they're more sheer,

317
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:53,286
softer, and more
like silk to the touch,

318
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:54,788
yet still very strong.

319
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,923
So you can pull them
down over and over?

320
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,509
You can wear them
quite a few times

321
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,678
before they run or lose shape.

322
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,213
Oh.

323
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:06,433
- Do you wear them, Joan?
- I do.

324
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:09,052
Well, if you talk to Dan,
I'd start with that.

325
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:15,142
Well, I think anyone
would be equally interested

326
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,893
in the price-per-unit,

327
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,613
which could be reduced significantly
if the demand were higher.

328
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,732
Why aren't you in
the brassiere business?

329
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,567
Excuse me?

330
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:26,486
You should be
in the bra business.

331
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,288
You're a work of art.

332
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:33,160
What she's saying
is that wider distribution

333
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:35,245
would mean bigger
ad budgets for us.

334
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,332
Well, I'd set a lunch,
but I think a dinner would be better.

335
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,134
And warm him up first.

336
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,336
Send a basket of pears
to Marshall Field's.

337
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:45,756
The one thing Dan likes
is a nice pear.

338
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,093
This guy.

339
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,511
What are their billings?

340
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:54,014
If you'd take a look
at the sheet there again...

341
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:55,732
Oh, yeah.
Give us a minute.

342
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:57,651
Let's read this thing.

343
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:09,644
Where were you?

344
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:11,396
Shirley, you're not
gonna believe this,

345
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:12,897
but I walked to work today.

346
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:15,483
Mr. Sterling
and Mr. Donnelly are here.

347
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:17,118
They just walked in.

348
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:23,825
You wanted to see me?

349
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,910
You know Ferguson Donnelly
from McCann.

350
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:27,662
Of course. Ferg.

351
00:19:27,664 --> 00:19:29,297
- Good to see you.
- Been a while.

352
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:35,503
Is this about the Topaz
department store route?

353
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:37,088
I think it's a great idea.

354
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,424
I don't know what
you're talking about.

355
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:43,061
Did you send Ed Baxter a $200 set of
MacGregor golf clubs from the firm?

356
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:44,896
Actually,
I hand-delivered it.

357
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,397
It was a retirement gift.

358
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,816
Huh, well, I've got
some bad news for you.

359
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:51,102
Pete's gonna take over Dow.

360
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:52,520
Because of the clubs?

361
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:55,189
No, because McCann doesn't
want you on the business.

362
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:57,859
Just because Ed's retiring

363
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:00,194
doesn't mean I can't get
along with his replacement.

364
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:01,863
I know Greg from metals.

365
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:04,365
I don't care if you know
a girl from Kalamazoo.

366
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,867
We don't want you
on the business

367
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,869
because we don't want
you on any business.

368
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,205
Look, Ferg,

369
00:20:11,257 --> 00:20:12,840
you're not still mad
at me for leaving?

370
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:15,510
That was six years ago.
And you never hired me anyway.

371
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:18,346
When you bought Puttnam Powell &
Lowe, I came with the furniture.

372
00:20:18,381 --> 00:20:21,215
People come in and out of our
doors all the time, Ken,

373
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:24,302
but they don't walk out with $4
million of Birds Eye products.

374
00:20:24,354 --> 00:20:26,137
Of course they do.

375
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,855
Fine.

376
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:30,274
They don't walk around the office
like their shit doesn't stink.

377
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,393
And then go out and tell
the world we're what,

378
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:34,812
a bunch of black Irish thugs.

379
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:38,366
So you're gonna fire me because
I hurt Ferg's feelings?

380
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,151
It's what he is.
Look at him.

381
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:41,903
How about a little dignity?

382
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:43,237
You're firing me!

383
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,790
Yes, but you're gonna get
a generous severance package

384
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:47,742
if you help Pete secure
all of your accounts.

385
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:49,293
Including Dow.

386
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:51,579
Roger said he'd be glad
to recommend you.

387
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:55,083
Thank you, Roger.
I appreciate your loyalty.

388
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:11,315
Should we get lunch?

389
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:14,268
I want to burn this place down.

390
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,904
I know.
They were awful.

391
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,407
But at least we got a yes.

392
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:21,943
Would you have rather
had a friendly no?

393
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,946
I don't expect you
to understand.

394
00:21:24,948 --> 00:21:29,083
Joan, you've never
experienced that before?

395
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:31,369
Have you, Peggy?

396
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,921
I don't know.
You can't have it both ways.

397
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:37,008
- You can't dress the way you do and expect--
- How do I dress?

398
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:40,128
Look, they didn't take
me seriously, either.

399
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,880
So what you're saying is

400
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:45,099
I don't dress the way you do

401
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:48,019
because I don't look like you.

402
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:51,105
And that's very, very true.

403
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:56,110
You know what?
You're filthy rich.

404
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:58,112
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to.

405
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:07,321
How was the cattle call?

406
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:09,207
We have to have
another session.

407
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:12,076
You're shameless,
you know that?

408
00:22:12,128 --> 00:22:13,494
Do I have a lunch today?

409
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:15,963
No, but you have
a busy afternoon.

410
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,666
Oh, I scheduled
a meeting next Monday

411
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:21,002
with Mr. Rosenthal at
Menken's Department Store.

412
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:23,671
Mrs. Katz didn't
want to meet?

413
00:22:23,673 --> 00:22:27,642
Well, it was a very
awkward conversation

414
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:30,728
because apparently she stepped
down a few months ago

415
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:33,097
and passed away last week.

416
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,650
What?

417
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,769
Rachel Katz?

418
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:40,855
Yes.

419
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:43,157
Well, I'm sorry
to tell you that.

420
00:22:43,193 --> 00:22:45,776
Last week?

421
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:55,620
I had no intention
of upsetting you.

422
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:57,338
How old was she?

423
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,926
I don't know.
Younger than me.

424
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:06,047
From the name I just
pictured some old lady.

425
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:08,049
I had no idea.

426
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:15,306
If you'd like, they've asked
that in lieu of flowers,

427
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:18,943
you can send a donation to the
National Jewish Hospital at Denver.

428
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:20,561
Do you want to do that?

429
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:25,066
No.

430
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,034
Yes, sure.

431
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:31,455
I'm going to run down
and get you a sandwich.

432
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,133
I'm shoving off.
Need anything else?

433
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:43,584
No.

434
00:23:45,588 --> 00:23:47,805
Ahem, Mathis.

435
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,507
Yes?

436
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,728
Well, if it helps you get back
into your wife's good graces,

437
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:55,763
I had a cancellation

438
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:58,349
and I'd love to join you
for dinner tomorrow night.

439
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,768
Shoot, we already
made other plans.

440
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,070
Oh.

441
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:06,774
Well, it wasn't meant to be.

442
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:09,527
Stevie doesn't need to come with us.
I'll sell his ticket.

443
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:11,445
Stevie?
How old is he?

444
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:13,080
I don't know, 30?

445
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:17,868
- I don't know.
- Ugh, can I go?

446
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:21,172
Give him my number.
Tell him to call me.

447
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:22,790
Okay.

448
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:40,107
- You want a menu?
- Just coffee.

449
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:41,809
And could you get
her attention for me?

450
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:45,279
Di, just coffee for him.

451
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:55,623
Evening.

452
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:57,491
Can I help you?

453
00:24:57,493 --> 00:25:00,795
You look so familiar to me.

454
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,747
Do I know you from somewhere?

455
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,249
Yes, from here.
The other night.

456
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:07,168
No.

457
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,337
I think I know you.

458
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:12,757
You don't need a line.
I know why you're here.

459
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:15,476
And it's not for
a cup of coffee.

460
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:20,848
Vi, I'm taking my break.

461
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,344
My name is Don.

462
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:55,693
Excuse me, miss.

463
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:57,862
When are you done here?

464
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:00,414
You got your $100's worth.

465
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,032
You can go.

466
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:12,800
- Have fun last night?
- Yes, I did.

467
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:16,136
He's very handsome,
I'll tell you that much.

468
00:27:16,172 --> 00:27:18,389
<i>Don. Don.</i>

469
00:27:24,814 --> 00:27:27,681
- Are you okay?
- I'm done.

470
00:27:29,018 --> 00:27:31,151
McCann told Roger to do it.

471
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:32,937
And, boy, did Roger do it.

472
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:36,023
They want me to giftwrap all my
accounts and give them to Pete.

473
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:38,325
I'm calling Jim Hobart
right now.

474
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:40,361
You're the head of accounts.

475
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:43,280
Do you want to hear
something spooky?

476
00:27:43,332 --> 00:27:45,783
Don't do anything rash, Ken.

477
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:46,917
It's just a job.

478
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:49,920
No, my father-in-law
retires

479
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:52,206
and my wife says,
"I want you to quit.

480
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:55,592
You're wasting your life.
You should write that novel."

481
00:27:55,628 --> 00:27:57,544
And you know what?

482
00:27:57,596 --> 00:27:59,213
I think I was gonna do it.

483
00:27:59,265 --> 00:28:02,549
And the very next day,
they fire me.

484
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:04,518
Can you believe that?

485
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:06,687
No.

486
00:28:06,722 --> 00:28:08,605
That's not a coincidence.

487
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:10,107
That's a sign.

488
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:12,026
Of what?

489
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:13,894
The life not lived.

490
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,866
So that's good?

491
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:22,403
Yeah. It's great.

492
00:28:23,572 --> 00:28:25,072
Now I just have to figure out

493
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,157
how to drag myself
through those doors.

494
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:40,254
<i>Joan, you have</i>
<i>a call from Dennis.</i>

495
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:42,723
- Dennis who?
- <i> I'm not sure.</i>

496
00:28:42,758 --> 00:28:45,809
<i>His girl just said Dennis.</i>
<i>He's at McCann-Erickson.</i>

497
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:49,980
It's Dennis Ford.

498
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:52,066
<i>Should I put him through?</i>

499
00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:55,486
No.

500
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:57,354
Tell him I'm in a meeting.

501
00:29:10,453 --> 00:29:12,002
So Clara just left?

502
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,171
She was as big as a house.

503
00:29:14,206 --> 00:29:16,256
Is Torkelson going
to marry her?

504
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:18,959
He's probably just
looking the other way.

505
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:21,295
People do that around
here all the time.

506
00:29:21,297 --> 00:29:23,630
I swear I found out
after you did.

507
00:29:23,682 --> 00:29:25,299
It came from McCann.

508
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:27,134
So did your millions
of dollars.

509
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:31,138
You know, I didn't
really get millions of dollars.

510
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,057
I mean, eventually,

511
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:35,059
but stepped out
in smaller increments

512
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:37,144
to stay under that
top tax threshold.

513
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:39,446
I might have to buy an apartment
building to hold onto any of it.

514
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:40,981
And then I've got
to be a landlord.

515
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:44,151
Sounds like a real
pain in the ass.

516
00:29:44,153 --> 00:29:47,121
Look, I was caught by surprise.

517
00:29:47,156 --> 00:29:49,540
But I didn't know
your history with McCann.

518
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:51,158
What did you do over there?

519
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:54,995
I never fit in.
I'm not Irish.

520
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:56,914
I'm not Catholic.
I can read.

521
00:29:56,966 --> 00:30:00,050
Well, it's good you're playing ball

522
00:30:00,086 --> 00:30:01,552
or you'd have no future.

523
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:03,170
In advertising maybe.

524
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:04,838
You have other plans?

525
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,392
Well, I may have
let it go for a while,

526
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:12,096
but damned if I don't have
something to write about now.

527
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:14,815
No, this world is boring.

528
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,600
You should write
an adventure story.

529
00:30:16,652 --> 00:30:20,187
I mean, do you know how great
you're gonna look on a book jacket?

530
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:22,940
I've thought about it.

531
00:30:22,992 --> 00:30:25,659
I'm a hell of a lot better
at it than I ever was at this.

532
00:30:25,694 --> 00:30:28,028
Good for you.

533
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,997
I'm envious.

534
00:30:30,032 --> 00:30:33,867
I thought I was really changing my
life when I went out to California.

535
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:36,837
Of course, now it sort
of feels like a dream.

536
00:30:36,872 --> 00:30:39,256
But at the time,
it felt so real.

537
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:42,459
Well, that's you, I guess.

538
00:30:42,511 --> 00:30:45,045
I know.
Look, here I am.

539
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:46,847
And you know what?

540
00:30:46,882 --> 00:30:48,348
If you get tired
of the writing,

541
00:30:48,384 --> 00:30:49,967
I hope you know
you can always use my name.

542
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,852
I have nothing but good
things to say about you.

543
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:55,556
I appreciate that.

544
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:58,058
Jesus, Fillmore Auto Parts?

545
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,444
You trying to give me stuff
we don't even have anymore?

546
00:31:21,717 --> 00:31:23,584
This is the same
as the navy one.

547
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:25,419
Well, don't tell
Oscar de la Renta

548
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:28,172
because the navy one is $159.

549
00:31:28,224 --> 00:31:30,174
I can wear boots with that.

550
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:33,677
You know what?
I'll take the boots

551
00:31:33,729 --> 00:31:35,596
and the tan heels,

552
00:31:35,648 --> 00:31:38,148
the chiffon, the red,

553
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:39,900
and this one.

554
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:43,237
Didn't you used to work here?

555
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:45,939
Because you can probably
still get the discount.

556
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:48,025
That's tempting,

557
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:51,161
but I think you have me
confused with someone else.

558
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:53,030
Could you?

559
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:02,422
<i>Ted wants to see you.</i>

560
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:07,177
Send him in.

561
00:32:08,547 --> 00:32:10,464
Just got off the phone
with Wilkinson.

562
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:12,466
They've narrowed it
down to three girls.

563
00:32:12,518 --> 00:32:13,967
They want me to send
over the binder,

564
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,353
but there's 120
Polaroids in here.

565
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:17,938
It's just gonna
make things worse.

566
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,690
What can I say?
They're perverts. They love casting.

567
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:23,193
They can't decide?
Use them all.

568
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:26,530
There are three women
in every man's life.

569
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:31,068
You did not just think that up.

570
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,819
Fine, I've had it for years,

571
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:34,321
but I really think
it works here.

572
00:32:34,323 --> 00:32:36,957
You'd rather find new creative
than pick a girl?

573
00:32:36,992 --> 00:32:40,210
Speaking of which, "Vogue" is throwing
a party in the Village tonight.

574
00:32:40,246 --> 00:32:42,212
Cocktails at my apartment.
It's right around the corner.

575
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:44,965
Apparently, hemlines
are going up.

576
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,833
What time?

577
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:49,803
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

578
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:58,679
So, you're from Atlanta?

579
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:00,397
No, I just went
to school there.

580
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:02,516
Emory, it's the only
game in town.

581
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:03,734
How about you?

582
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:06,653
Me? Oh, no.
I didn't go to college.

583
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:09,156
I went right to work.
I was a secretary.

584
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:11,241
That's interesting.

585
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:12,826
Is it?

586
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:16,196
Ah, here we go.

587
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:20,701
Oh, this smells delicious.

588
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:23,954
It does.

589
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:26,006
Didn't you order lasagna?

590
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,958
This is just as good.

591
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:32,262
Do you want my cannelloni?
It's like lasagna.

592
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:34,548
More than veal, anyway.

593
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,383
Are you trying to make
this more complicated?

594
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:39,436
I don't know why you're eating
something you didn't order.

595
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:40,721
Do you like veal?

596
00:33:40,723 --> 00:33:42,306
What am I supposed to do?

597
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:44,107
Send it back
like a prima donna?

598
00:33:44,143 --> 00:33:46,810
So you're just gonna eat
someone else's dinner?

599
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:50,480
So I can either be a jerk
and send it back,

600
00:33:50,532 --> 00:33:52,149
or eat it and look weak.

601
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:56,203
I don't want this to get cold.

602
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,541
Johnny said you were the kind of
girl who doesn't put up with things.

603
00:34:01,577 --> 00:34:03,210
Really?

604
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,496
What else did Mathis say?

605
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:11,418
He said you were funny.

606
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,470
And that you were fearless.

607
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,564
I love veal.

608
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,150
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

609
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,702
Should I take my shoes off?

610
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:07,238
No, that's just
for the mourners.

611
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,740
I just wanted
to pay my respects.

612
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:11,242
I worked with Rachel.

613
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:12,910
At the store?

614
00:35:12,912 --> 00:35:14,495
I'm Barbara, her sister.

615
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,747
I'm Don Draper.
I'm in advertising.

616
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:20,418
Oh.

617
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,420
I know who you are.

618
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,840
Excuse me, do you mind?

619
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:27,425
We need one more
for our minyan.

620
00:35:27,427 --> 00:35:28,926
I'd be glad to help.

621
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:31,345
He can't.
He's not Jewish.

622
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:34,598
Okay.
I'll go and knock on some doors.

623
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,851
You shouldn't do it.
Let one of them do it.

624
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:38,769
Barbara, they're my neighbors.

625
00:35:42,024 --> 00:35:43,574
We're sitting shiva.

626
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:47,078
It's a seven-day memorial
period after the funeral.

627
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:49,330
I've lived in New York
a long time.

628
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:50,915
I brought cake.

629
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,118
You did.

630
00:35:57,457 --> 00:36:00,091
So, how is your family?

631
00:36:02,178 --> 00:36:04,712
I got divorced.

632
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:07,298
And I got remarried, actually.

633
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,799
You left your wife for her?

634
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:11,635
No, it didn't
work out that way.

635
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,556
I'm actually getting
divorced again.

636
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,692
I'm sorry.

637
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:25,816
Are those her children?

638
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:28,953
Yes.

639
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:31,489
When's the last time
you spoke to her?

640
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:34,158
Years ago.
Before them.

641
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,131
What happened to her?

642
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:44,001
She had leukemia.

643
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:56,430
I'm sorry. I don't know what
you're looking for here.

644
00:36:56,482 --> 00:36:59,483
I guess I just wanted to find out
what was happening in her life.

645
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,686
She lived the life
she wanted to live.

646
00:37:02,738 --> 00:37:05,022
She had everything.

647
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:09,160
Good.

648
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:11,195
I have to help.
I'm sorry.

649
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:36,470
Johnny Mathis.

650
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:38,722
How many times has he shown up

651
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:41,559
and people have been
disappointed?

652
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:43,444
"You are not
Johnny Mathis."

653
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,813
I've never thought of that.

654
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,567
You don't seem like a lawyer.

655
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,536
Well, I just left
a firm in Boston

656
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:54,071
because they felt the same way.

657
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:00,244
I once quit a job because
I wanted to go to Paris.

658
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,379
Do they do that in advertising?

659
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:06,133
Sure. We shoot commercials
abroad all the time.

660
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:07,918
Well, some people do.

661
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,255
So all you have to do
is write something in Paris

662
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:12,923
and you can go.
Am I wrong?

663
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:16,510
Yes. That's not
how it works.

664
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:18,729
Well, next vacation.

665
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:24,101
I haven't taken a vacation...

666
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:27,271
well, never.

667
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,443
You know what?
Let's go.

668
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:34,662
Sure. Where?

669
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:37,248
To Paris.

670
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,949
Let's go to Paris.

671
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:40,534
Right now.

672
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:45,422
You think you're
kidding around,

673
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:48,259
- but I don't have a job.
- I'm not kidding.

674
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:51,679
Okay. I'm getting
the check.

675
00:38:51,714 --> 00:38:53,464
And I'm getting my coat.

676
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,473
I can't find it.

677
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,275
I've never actually used it.

678
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,226
You've never used
your passport?

679
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:21,792
- Stop.
- What? Why?

680
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,744
Flight's not till 6:00.

681
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:25,296
I hate to disappoint you,

682
00:39:25,331 --> 00:39:26,880
but I don't need
that much time.

683
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:32,886
I can't believe this.

684
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:35,172
I can't find my passport.

685
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:39,059
It's okay.
This is a romantic spot.

686
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:43,180
Stevie.

687
00:39:43,182 --> 00:39:45,316
I'm sorry,

688
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,818
but what were we
going to do in Paris?

689
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:51,522
I thought you were a fling,

690
00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:56,160
but now I think
maybe you're more.

691
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:59,163
I don't want to sleep with you
on the night we first met.

692
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:01,198
That's so old-fashioned.

693
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:05,536
I've tried new-fashioned.

694
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:08,872
Well, if I have to go
back to Boston...

695
00:40:08,924 --> 00:40:10,457
I don't even know
if I'm going to get this job.

696
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:14,511
Don't you worry.
I am going to find that passport.

697
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:17,464
We can go next weekend.

698
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:21,135
I have an interview
in DC next weekend.

699
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:22,853
How about the weekend after?

700
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:24,555
Perfect.

701
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:28,559
You really want me to go now?

702
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,897
Just call me when you
get back from DC.

703
00:40:41,957 --> 00:40:43,323
I will.

704
00:40:43,376 --> 00:40:45,075
Good.

705
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:15,266
<i>10 days ago with my report to</i>
<i>the nation on Vietnam,</i>

706
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:17,635
I announced the decision
to withdraw

707
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:20,304
an additional 150,000 Americans

708
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:23,040
from Vietnam
over the next year.

709
00:41:23,143 --> 00:41:27,245
<i>I said then that I was</i>
<i>making that decision</i>

710
00:41:27,347 --> 00:41:31,282
<i>despite our concern over increased
enemy activity in Laos.</i>

711
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:52,052
I've secured Birds Eye.

712
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:54,054
I think Ferguson Donnelly
is one happy man.

713
00:41:54,106 --> 00:41:56,139
More like a man and a half.

714
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:59,810
As my father would say, he
really puts the mick in McCann.

715
00:41:59,862 --> 00:42:02,896
<i>Ken's here for the meeting.</i>

716
00:42:02,948 --> 00:42:05,566
- Did you invite him?
- To this meeting?

717
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:08,569
Oh, hello, Pete.

718
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:11,822
Roger, I just wanted to let you know
I won't be collecting severance.

719
00:42:11,874 --> 00:42:14,658
You got another job?
Good for you.

720
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,076
But you're still entitled.

721
00:42:16,128 --> 00:42:17,828
It wouldn't be right.

722
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,831
My signing bonus from Dow is so big,
it feels like a second helping.

723
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:24,334
What the hell
are you talking about?

724
00:42:24,386 --> 00:42:27,304
See, I wasn't just
Ed's son-in-law.

725
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:29,673
They actually value
their relationships.

726
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:32,059
Well, I suppose they need
a guy in fertilizer.

727
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:35,262
I'm taking Tom Schaeffer's old post.

728
00:42:35,314 --> 00:42:36,647
Head of advertising.

729
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:40,400
So you're going to fire us?

730
00:42:40,436 --> 00:42:43,270
No, it's going to be
way worse than that.

731
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:45,188
I'm going to be your client.

732
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:48,492
And I hate to tell you,
but I'm very hard to please.

733
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:53,030
Until we meet again.

734
00:42:58,037 --> 00:43:00,037
Shit.

735
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:14,051
Taking Fleischmann's
Margarine to the studio.

736
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:15,719
If you want changes,
we got to talk now.

737
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:17,721
Sure, fine, just
keep your voice down.

738
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:20,057
I commandeered these.

739
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:22,643
Sounds like you had
quite a night.

740
00:43:22,695 --> 00:43:23,977
It was nice.

741
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:25,729
With who?

742
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:27,948
She's going to Europe
with my brother-in-law.

743
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:30,284
You know, Julie and I went
to Paris on our honeymoon

744
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,735
if you need any
recommendations.

745
00:43:31,737 --> 00:43:34,738
I don't know where I'm going,
but you have work to do.

746
00:43:40,713 --> 00:43:42,913
Paris, huh?

747
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:44,798
Where margarine was invented.

748
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,583
Wow.

749
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:48,669
First date magic.

750
00:43:48,721 --> 00:43:50,671
I had too much wine

751
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:53,056
and I totally
embarrassed myself.

752
00:43:53,092 --> 00:43:55,225
Sounds like you
had a good time.

753
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,395
I'm not going to get on a plane
with somebody I barely know.

754
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,598
But you'd get to know him.
Sounds like fun.

755
00:44:03,402 --> 00:44:05,652
It's nothing a couple
of Aspirin won't fix.

756
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:17,164
Meredith, I'm leaving
for the day.

757
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:24,788
I got a little research
for your meeting.

758
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,290
Mr. Rosenthal is first
thing Monday morning.

759
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:29,626
- Who?
- Mr. Rosenthal.

760
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:32,129
From Menken's Department Store.

761
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:33,714
Pantyhose.

762
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:38,552
Thank you.

763
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,962
I've got this.

764
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:07,631
Hello.

765
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,416
I don't know why you're here,

766
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:10,917
but that's not
going to happen again.

767
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:13,503
Wait.

768
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:15,005
What?

769
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,059
I...

770
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:22,646
had this dream about
a woman I once knew.

771
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:27,350
And I found out the next
day she had just died.

772
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:31,354
Is that who you think I am?

773
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:34,825
No, I don't think so.

774
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,327
Well, I want you
to think very carefully

775
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:38,829
about when you
really had that dream,

776
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:41,948
because when people die,
everything gets mixed up.

777
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,701
I don't know.
Maybe.

778
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:47,671
Maybe you dreamt
about her all the time.

779
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:50,874
Maybe.

780
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:54,544
When someone dies, you just
want to make sense out of it.

781
00:45:54,596 --> 00:45:57,047
But you can't.

782
00:46:01,603 --> 00:46:04,888
I'm not saying this to lead you
on or make you more interested,

783
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,474
but the next time you come in
here, please bring a date.

784
00:46:08,944 --> 00:46:10,777
I just work here.

785
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:14,231
I just want to sit here.

786
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:21,371
Okay.

787
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:27,744
<i>And then I fell in love</i>

788
00:46:27,796 --> 00:46:31,214
<i>with the most wonderful</i>
<i>boy in the world.</i>

789
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,751
<i>We'd take long walks</i>
<i>down by the river,</i>

790
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:37,304
<i>or just sit for hours</i>

791
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,222
<i>gazing into each other's eyes.</i>

792
00:46:39,258 --> 00:46:42,592
<i>We were so very much in love.</i>

793
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,644
<i>And then one day,</i>

794
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,630
<i>you went away.</i>

795
00:46:46,665 --> 00:46:49,910
<i>And I thought I'd die,</i>
<i>but I didn't.</i>
