00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,469
Hello?

3
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:05,444
Don.

4
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,014
Don.

5
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:10,250
Draper!

6
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:17,891
Oh, Melanie. I'm sorry.
I must have overslept.

7
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:19,893
They're coming before work.

8
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:22,461
I told your service,
but you never called me back.

9
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:24,430
There's no time for a shower.

10
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:31,036
I'll make the bed.

11
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:43,782
Thought you were having
the carpets cleaned.

12
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:45,650
I did.

13
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:50,622
I find it hard to believe I have
to replace it to sell this place.

14
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:53,090
Couldn't you rent
a couple of pieces?

15
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,892
It's so lonely.

16
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:56,394
It's better.

17
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:59,364
They can imagine
their own things in it.

18
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:01,499
Have you ever sold
an apartment?

19
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:04,302
I've sold a lot
uglier things than this.

20
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:06,671
Can you go?

21
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,673
I don't want you
crossing paths.

22
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:14,578
Good luck.

23
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:31,829
Hello?

24
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:34,997
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

25
00:02:38,802 --> 00:02:40,603
Hello?

26
00:02:42,973 --> 00:02:45,341
Yes, Mom, you woke me.

27
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,210
I don't know. I'm not
due at the office yet.

28
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:52,147
Los Angeles
is three hours earlier.

29
00:02:52,182 --> 00:02:54,350
It's simple subtraction.

30
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,352
I want to talk to him, too.

31
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:00,756
Well, hello, sweetie.

32
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,157
Do you know
how much I miss you?

33
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:05,360
What did you and Grandma
Gail do this morning?

34
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,963
Hello?

35
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:10,965
Hello?

36
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,608
Room service, please.

37
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,844
I'd like a glass of skim milk,

38
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,115
a grapefruit,
and a pot of coffee.

39
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:29,317
And some French toast.

40
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:39,260
- You wanted to see me?
- Come in. Have a seat.

41
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:43,397
Can I offer you something?
A pad and pen perhaps?

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,902
You know, I could have you killed for
drinking anything but a Coke around here.

43
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,904
To whom it may concern?

44
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,740
Our benevolent overlords
at McCann

45
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:56,509
have invited select presidents
of select subsidiaries

46
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,178
to a godless retreat
in the Bahamas.

47
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:00,447
So you have to make a speech.

48
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:02,949
That's what I thought. I figured
it'd be like a toast, you know?

49
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:04,383
I'm good at that.

50
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:05,919
Apparently Caroline
looked at the fine print

51
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:07,587
and they're expecting some
sort of written statement

52
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:09,989
on the future of this company.
2,500 words.

53
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:12,024
- When?
- By Monday.

54
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:14,928
It's plenty of time. Harry's writing
a manifesto on the computer.

55
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:16,763
Chaough's doing
performance reviews.

56
00:04:16,797 --> 00:04:19,365
And they need to finish with a nice
Gettysburg Address type speech

57
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,934
that tells them where
we're gonna be next year.

58
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:22,568
<i>Mr. Sterling,</i>

59
00:04:22,602 --> 00:04:24,503
<i>there's a call for you</i>
<i>on line three.</i>

60
00:04:24,537 --> 00:04:26,805
Gettysburg Address.
Got it.

61
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,007
I'd do it myself, but
one of us is very busy.

62
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,742
You're going to the Bahamas.

63
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:33,779
I'm sorry.
How are you doing?

64
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:36,482
Never been better.

65
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,851
Well, you've looked better. You
want me to get my barber in here?

66
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:41,653
Anything else?

67
00:04:41,688 --> 00:04:43,588
Here are the specs.

68
00:04:43,622 --> 00:04:45,790
Just, uh, reasonable
hopes and dreams.

69
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:47,158
Doesn't have to be
science fiction.

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,296
<i>Roger?</i>

71
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:00,105
You must be Dee.

72
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,540
What a pleasure to meet
you in the flesh.

73
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:09,913
Top of the morning.
How was your trip?

74
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:11,615
So far so good.

75
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:13,917
- How about that sun?
- Yes.

76
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:15,585
Have you been
to California before?

77
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,987
Listen, I've got
to run an errand.

78
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:19,423
I'll be back. First
appointment is at noon.

79
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:21,625
Did we have a cancellation?

80
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,960
You're interviewing people
who already have jobs.

81
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:26,162
They have to sneak out.
It's lunch or breakfast.

82
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:29,332
Well, I thought we could
rank the candidates in advance.

83
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:31,467
Come on, I did it, you did it.

84
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:34,337
No need to do it together.
Santa Monica or Sunset?

85
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:36,305
Sunset to Highland to Cahuenga.

86
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,446
Why don't you show me around?

87
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,515
How is the Beverly Wilshire?

88
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:47,016
Have you seen Warren Beatty?

89
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,717
Not yet.

90
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,922
More money, bigger accounts,

91
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:54,557
more awards,

92
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,158
international business,

93
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:58,027
and a space station?

94
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:00,128
Gas station.

95
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:02,898
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

96
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:05,100
- Do you have my thesaurus?
- Probably.

97
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:07,869
Listen, you need to sign off
on the Peter Pan cookie.

98
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:10,404
- He's very busy.
- Stay out of this.

99
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,941
We can't take it out without you
signing off on it and you know it.

100
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:21,382
- Let's go.
- Do you need me to set it up?

101
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:23,184
No, just broad strokes.

102
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,021
Peter Pan's best friend
is Tinker Bell.

103
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,757
That's why his delicious
cookie is named after her.

104
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,726
We have a series
of Dear John letters

105
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,129
in children's handwriting
with kid voice-over

106
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:36,863
<i>explaining why they've</i>
<i>left the competitors</i>

107
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:38,932
for the unique taste
of Tinker Bell cookies

108
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,968
made with real
Peter Pan Peanut Butter.

109
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,737
Each letter has a little
joke about the competition.

110
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,706
"Dear Nilla Wafers,

111
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,141
it's so plain it's over.
Susie."

112
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:51,712
"Dear Oreos, don't split
apart, I love another."

113
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,580
"Dear Chips Ahoy,
I hope--"

114
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:54,848
Okay, I get it.

115
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:57,217
And then a cartoon touch
of the wand on the cookie.

116
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,485
A sparkle.

117
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,220
"Peter Pan Peanut Butter lovers

118
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:03,289
love Tinker Bell cookies
more than all others."

119
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,259
Jesus, love again?

120
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,961
We use it all the time.

121
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,931
Kids won't get it and
adults won't hear it.

122
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,966
It's not up for debate.
Do we have another line?

123
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,901
"One Tink
and you're hooked."

124
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,870
What's wrong with that?

125
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,371
I was worried.

126
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,240
How will they know
Tink is Tinker Bell?

127
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,276
Because you're gonna tell them
five times in 60 seconds.

128
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,946
Are we still going to be ready?

129
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,948
That's why we had this meeting.

130
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,221
Jim McCloud is gonna be here any minute.
Where's Lou?

131
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:39,428
He called.
He's running late.

132
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:40,725
He called?
From where?

133
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,527
Don't be mad at him.

134
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,529
He's working on
something very big.

135
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:46,131
What?

136
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,034
Between us,
Hanna-Barbera.

137
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:51,869
The cartoon studio?

138
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:55,473
Yes. They're very interested
in this comic he created.

139
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:58,909
It's like Gomer Pyle,
but he's a monkey.

140
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,744
How long has this
been going on?

141
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,546
Since he was in the army.

142
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,749
- I think he misses it.
- That's not what I meant.

143
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:10,353
Hello.
How are you?

144
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:12,489
You must be Mr. McCloud.

145
00:08:12,523 --> 00:08:15,458
Yes. Yes, I am.
And you are?

146
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:17,027
I'm Joan Harris.

147
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:18,962
I'm an account executive
and a partner.

148
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,198
Mr. Avery is stuck
in traffic,

149
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,566
but I suppose we can begin.
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,335
Dee, would you offer
Mr. McCloud some coffee?

151
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:28,071
Please.

152
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:29,305
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.

153
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:30,639
I was catching up
with Jim here.

154
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:33,176
Jim McCloud, Joan Harris.

155
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:37,580
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

156
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:39,716
Jim, come on in.
Take a load off.

157
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,417
Dee, can you get me a Sanka?

158
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:46,722
Who are you?

159
00:08:46,756 --> 00:08:48,924
Richard Burghoff.

160
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,926
I'm looking for my optometrist.

161
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,961
Why didn't you say so?

162
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:55,331
A woman like you
wants to talk to me--

163
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,165
I'm a little nearsighted,
I'm not blind.

164
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:00,603
Have dinner with me.

165
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:01,903
I don't know.

166
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,307
I want to see
if I can get the job.

167
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,212
<i>Joan, are you coming or not?</i>

168
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:13,248
- I have to go.
- French?

169
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:25,827
Why am I signing these now?

170
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:28,429
Because you sign it again
when they cash it.

171
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:30,298
That's how they know it's you.

172
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:33,934
But anyone who steals this
could copy my signature, too.

173
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,203
They have it worked out, Sally.

174
00:09:36,238 --> 00:09:37,905
Why are you snapping at me?

175
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:39,674
This trip was your idea.

176
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,609
I'm going to miss you.

177
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:46,247
You should really talk to them
about Colonial Williamsburg.

178
00:09:46,282 --> 00:09:47,749
You're driving right by it.

179
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:50,151
It's 12 states in 12 days.

180
00:09:50,185 --> 00:09:51,652
They can't stop everywhere.

181
00:09:51,686 --> 00:09:54,488
Well, when I did the trip,
it was six states.

182
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,090
Weren't they still colonies?

183
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:01,162
We got into a little
bit of trouble.

184
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:03,597
And I want you to know
that's to be expected.

185
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:05,866
Trouble?
Really?

186
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:09,036
You know, staying up all night.

187
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:13,539
We would try and break
all the lightbulbs

188
00:10:13,573 --> 00:10:15,374
in the hallway at every hotel.

189
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,945
We're not going to do that.

190
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:21,380
Well...

191
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:24,017
there are going
to be boys everywhere

192
00:10:24,051 --> 00:10:26,085
and you're going to be
away from home,

193
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,088
so I hope you have
the good sense

194
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:32,692
to not act like you've
been let out of a cage.

195
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:34,660
I'm sorry, Mother,

196
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:37,129
but this conversation
is a little late.

197
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,099
And so am I.

198
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,936
Everything is a joke to you.

199
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,549
- How'd it go?
- About how I expected.

200
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:01,353
They loved the lobby, but
the emptiness is a problem.

201
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:03,188
There's other ways
to sell things.

202
00:11:03,223 --> 00:11:05,457
I'm using everything I have.

203
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,826
But this requires
too much imagination.

204
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,928
That's the best
opportunity in the world.

205
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:13,332
Who's your best prospect?

206
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:15,367
It was a young stockbroker
from New Jersey

207
00:11:15,401 --> 00:11:17,769
with a four-year-old
and one on the way.

208
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,570
Why don't you tell them
somebody lived here

209
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:22,406
who made a million dollars
inventing the Frisbee?

210
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,143
And they had to move in a
hurry to a castle in France.

211
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:28,479
Taxes.

212
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,948
A little glamor, a little hope.

213
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,884
I'm not a magician.

214
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:35,386
I have to show it to people
with their eyes open.

215
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,088
And you know
what it looks like?

216
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:40,491
It looks like
a sad person lives here.

217
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:43,060
And what happened to him?
He got divorced,

218
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:45,661
spilled wine on the carpeting and
didn't care enough to replace it.

219
00:11:45,696 --> 00:11:47,163
Even for himself.

220
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:48,698
Don't blame your failure on me.

221
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:50,700
This place reeks of failure.

222
00:11:50,734 --> 00:11:53,003
It is an $85,000
fixer-upper.

223
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:55,838
A lot of wonderful things
happened here.

224
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:58,408
Well, you wouldn't know it.

225
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:05,048
I have a good feeling
about things.

226
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,883
See you tomorrow.

227
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,498
You know I have
a very early flight.

228
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,968
You are not going anywhere.

229
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:27,970
I'm serious.

230
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:30,838
Joan, I've been
in prison for five years.

231
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:32,840
You're acting like it.

232
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,278
Here's the plan.

233
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:39,347
First, I'm gonna kiss you.

234
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:40,581
I know the rest of this.

235
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:42,550
Then you're gonna
cancel your flight.

236
00:12:42,584 --> 00:12:46,187
Then I'm gonna drive you
up to Malibu for lobster

237
00:12:46,221 --> 00:12:49,857
in one of those tourist traps
where everyone's getting engaged.

238
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:52,292
Then on up to the Biltmore
in Santa Barbara

239
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,594
where I'll sit
on a lounge chair

240
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:57,197
and watch you get in
and out of the pool.

241
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,568
Richard, that sounds wonderful.

242
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:03,736
But I have someplace to be.

243
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:06,440
And I'm sure you do as well.

244
00:13:06,474 --> 00:13:08,541
I told you, I'm retired.

245
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:10,844
Yes.

246
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:13,447
And you were
a millionaire developer.

247
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:15,547
You must think
I just fell off a truck.

248
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:18,084
Are you a movie producer as well?

249
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:20,953
No.

250
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:23,589
But the rest of it
is the truth, honey.

251
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,594
What is the rest of it?

252
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:31,563
I guess we've been
dancing around this all night.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,633
I'm divorced.

254
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,135
You?

255
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:39,805
You think I would be
doing this if I was married?

256
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,908
Have you ever been married?

257
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:44,843
Yes.

258
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:46,578
Boy, did he blow it.

259
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:49,548
He did.

260
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:56,688
22 years.

261
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:59,057
I stayed in it for the kids.

262
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:03,461
And when my youngest graduated,

263
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:05,963
I saw her heading off to Europe

264
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:10,402
and I thought,
"Jeez, that looks good."

265
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:12,670
I mean, hell,
I built something.

266
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:15,640
I built a lot of things.

267
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:18,410
But I also put off
a lot of things.

268
00:14:18,444 --> 00:14:20,578
And now I'm free.

269
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,747
As a bird.

270
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:25,483
I need to work.

271
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:29,654
So you have mouths to feed?

272
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:32,657
No.

273
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:38,596
I just finally got the job
I've always wanted.

274
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:43,267
So you're just an executive
on a trip out of town.

275
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:45,603
I'll send you flowers.

276
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,645
Morning, Meredith.

277
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,547
Mr. Sterling came by
for your prognostication.

278
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:09,282
I told him you were
at the library.

279
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:10,818
That's not a bad idea.

280
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:13,587
And can you dig up the press
release from when we started SCDP?

281
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,455
That would be December '63.

282
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,290
- Coffee?
- Morning, Don.

283
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,629
No. I'll get it.

284
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,271
Meredith got me two of these.
I only need one.

285
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,473
Sure.

286
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:36,143
When are you casting
St. Joseph's?

287
00:15:36,177 --> 00:15:37,410
Two weeks.

288
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:39,579
Did you meet someone
we should see?

289
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:43,449
No, just organizing
my schedule.

290
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:47,119
You ever feel like there's less to
actually do, but more to think about?

291
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,355
Not really.

292
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,356
Maybe I'm a bad manager.

293
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,592
Maybe I'm too, what do
they call it, hands-on.

294
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:58,930
So, going to this casting session.
What's next?

295
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,133
Shoot the ad?

296
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:05,470
No, what's the future
going to bring?

297
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:08,606
I mean, it's good as it is,

298
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:10,475
but is there a scenario
in which it's better?

299
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,644
You're incredible.

300
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:14,979
You know, Roger asked me
to do that first.

301
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:18,916
How'd you get out of it?

302
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,353
I thought about it a little
and then I realized

303
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:25,690
you're so much better
at painting a picture.

304
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:27,192
So you did have thoughts.

305
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:29,394
Sure.

306
00:16:29,428 --> 00:16:31,062
We'll have an oil company.

307
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:32,863
You know, maybe Goodyear Tires.

308
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:34,464
We know so much about cars.

309
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:36,200
That's your dream?

310
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:41,005
No, I mean, obviously
I'd like to one day--

311
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,539
I don't know.

312
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:45,609
What?

313
00:16:47,913 --> 00:16:52,750
I'd really love to land
a pharmaceutical.

314
00:16:53,952 --> 00:16:56,320
Bigger accounts?

315
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:58,522
That's your greatest desire?

316
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:00,490
That's why I'm doing
the performance reviews.

317
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:05,229
You know, before McCann
all I ever thought of

318
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:07,030
was will we be
in business next year?

319
00:17:07,064 --> 00:17:09,233
Or will I be here at all?

320
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:12,035
Now it could be anything.

321
00:17:17,842 --> 00:17:20,276
<i>I have a Richard
Burghoff on the line.</i>

322
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,679
I'll take it.

323
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,220
Hello.

324
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:33,522
Well, your story checks out.

325
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,827
It's nice to hear from you.

326
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:39,562
How are things in paradise?

327
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:41,830
I don't know.
I'm in town.

328
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:43,899
What?
You're in New York?

329
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:46,034
Tell me where we're eating.

330
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:49,872
The Oak Room, 7:30.

331
00:17:49,906 --> 00:17:52,040
Should I pick you up
at work or at home?

332
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:53,676
I'll see you there.

333
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,511
Well, good.

334
00:17:55,545 --> 00:17:57,846
You can make an entrance.

335
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:12,527
There you are.

336
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:13,996
There <i>you</i> are.

337
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,064
We have a peanut butter
cookie problem.

338
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:19,201
Don, don't listen to him.
Pete, what are you doing?

339
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:22,437
- The client hated the layout.
- Exactly, that's the problem.

340
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:25,507
And then Mathis and Ed
turned on each other.

341
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:28,109
There was some kind of
"I told you so" exchange

342
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:31,713
which was already
unbearably inappropriate.

343
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:34,382
And then Mathis said...

344
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,184
a four-letter word
that starts with F.

345
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:37,719
Have you ever heard
such a thing?

346
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:40,054
He was frustrated.
He can't fire my men.

347
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:42,156
- I can fire you.
- Hold on.

348
00:18:42,191 --> 00:18:43,757
Nobody's getting fired.

349
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,327
- You have to send those idiots back in.
- Absolutely not.

350
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:48,862
If you send someone new,
it looks like we're starting over.

351
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,832
It was a crime of passion.
They've heard the word before.

352
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:54,435
Fine.

353
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:56,269
I want new work fast.

354
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:57,904
Problem solved.

355
00:19:08,282 --> 00:19:09,649
May I help you?

356
00:19:09,683 --> 00:19:12,552
Is Sally home?
I'm a friend of hers.

357
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,387
Sally.

358
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,489
There's a young man
here to see you.

359
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,127
- What's your name, ma'am?
- It's Loretta.

360
00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:23,063
Is Mrs. Draper home?

361
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:24,764
You mean Mrs. Francis.

362
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,366
What are you doing here?

363
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,736
I was in the neighborhood.

364
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:33,673
You know Betty's home.

365
00:19:33,707 --> 00:19:35,975
I don't care.
I just wanted to see you.

366
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,110
See?
You survived finals.

367
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,715
- How's your summer?
- I'm going on a teen tour.

368
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,484
Then maybe be
a lifeguard again.

369
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,718
Do you have something
to do right now?

370
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,987
I got it.

371
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,122
I got it.

372
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,858
Hey, I'll be out in a second.

373
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,126
I have to use the restroom.

374
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,295
This is Paula.
This is Sally.

375
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,632
Hey there. Could you get me
a map to the powder room?

376
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,801
First door on the left.

377
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,938
- Hello.
- You have a lovely home.

378
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:11,909
Sally, I didn't know
you had guests.

379
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,746
We just dropped by.

380
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,148
We were on our way to Playland and
thought maybe you'd want to come.

381
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,319
Aren't you going
to introduce me?

382
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:25,988
I'm Glen Bishop.

383
00:20:26,023 --> 00:20:27,857
We lived up the street
in Ossining.

384
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:31,394
Glen?

385
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:33,463
My goodness.

386
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:34,964
How old are you?

387
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:36,599
18.

388
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:40,236
So, you two
have stayed in touch?

389
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,639
- Yeah.
- We've been pen pals.

390
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:44,541
What have you been
doing with yourself?

391
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,576
You look so different.

392
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,944
You look exactly the same.

393
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:52,915
Good, you found my backpack.

394
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:54,683
Yes, it was in
the storage room.

395
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:56,852
You must be in school.

396
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:58,887
Yeah, just finished my
freshman year up at Purchase.

397
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:00,689
That's supposed
to be very good.

398
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:03,158
I'm actually going back
to school myself this fall.

399
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:05,694
Very cool.

400
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:12,400
Can I have some actual money
to take to Playland?

401
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:15,670
What? Of course.
Go get my pocketbook.

402
00:21:15,704 --> 00:21:17,305
Can't you?

403
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:22,110
Hey. Sorry for
running past you.

404
00:21:22,144 --> 00:21:24,446
My mother hates that.
Just really had to go.

405
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,414
That's quite all right.

406
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,315
Can I offer you all
something to drink?

407
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,916
- Iced tea?
- No.

408
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:31,418
I'd take a beer
if you've got one.

409
00:21:31,453 --> 00:21:32,886
- Of course.
- Hold on.

410
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,755
I thought we were going to Playland.
Are you coming?

411
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,825
I'd love to go with you,
but I don't have any money.

412
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,395
Do you talk to
your parents this way?

413
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:47,066
Do you have any grass?

414
00:21:47,101 --> 00:21:49,268
We can get it there.

415
00:21:51,338 --> 00:21:54,374
Don't stay too late.
You have to pack.

416
00:21:54,408 --> 00:21:56,642
Nice meeting you.

417
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:59,212
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

418
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:02,215
- Betty.
- Yes?

419
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:04,950
I feel like I should say
a more formal good-bye.

420
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:08,487
Nonsense.

421
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:09,922
You're welcome here anytime.

422
00:22:09,956 --> 00:22:11,724
No.

423
00:22:11,758 --> 00:22:14,226
It's just that...

424
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,128
I'm shipping out next week.

425
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:19,565
What do you mean?

426
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,800
I'm reporting.

427
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:23,769
He joined the army.

428
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:26,171
Are you kidding?

429
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:27,840
No.

430
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:29,541
Are you fucking stupid?

431
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:31,910
- Sally!
- I don't expect you to understand.

432
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:34,746
- You hate the war.
- Not anymore.

433
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,815
What about Kent State?
You were crying.

434
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,617
You were gonna join
the movement.

435
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,285
What about a bunch
of Negro kids dying

436
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,755
while we just sit at home getting stoned?
It's immoral.

437
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:44,989
Was this your idea?

438
00:22:45,024 --> 00:22:47,659
We just met.

439
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:51,227
You're gonna die.
For what?

440
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:53,229
Don't listen
to Jane Fonda here.

441
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:55,365
It's a very brave thing to do.

442
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:59,803
You know what?
Have fun at Playland.

443
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,272
Just remember those kids
are the same age

444
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:04,908
as the ones you're going
to be murdering in Vietnam.

445
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:07,578
Sally, come on.

446
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:12,715
I'm sorry.

447
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,784
No.

448
00:23:14,818 --> 00:23:16,886
I expected it.

449
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:21,391
Well, you've obviously grown
into a fine young man.

450
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,260
Thank you, ma'am.

451
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,998
Please don't let this
mar your afternoon.

452
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,899
We'll see you
when you get back.

453
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:32,901
Sally, too.

454
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:48,883
Fourscore and seven years ago.

455
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,056
We know where we've been,
we know where we are.

456
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:57,325
Let's assume that it's good.

457
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:03,131
But it's got to get better.

458
00:24:06,102 --> 00:24:08,802
It's supposed to get better.

459
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:12,172
<i>Mr. Mathis needs to see you.</i>

460
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:13,941
<i>I told him you were busy.</i>

461
00:24:16,044 --> 00:24:17,878
Send him in.

462
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:22,116
Hello, Don.

463
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,618
Just wanted to thank you
for fighting for me.

464
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:26,219
Who told you that?

465
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:29,556
Should we open it?

466
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,324
I'm set.

467
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,361
I appreciate
your confidence in me.

468
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:36,363
What do you want?

469
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:38,198
I want you to come
to the meeting.

470
00:24:38,232 --> 00:24:41,100
No.

471
00:24:41,135 --> 00:24:43,270
You have to make this
right yourself.

472
00:24:43,304 --> 00:24:45,138
How?

473
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:47,374
I mean, do I apologize to them?

474
00:24:47,408 --> 00:24:48,874
Do I apologize to Ed?

475
00:24:48,908 --> 00:24:51,109
Do I slam my hand
in the door over and over?

476
00:24:51,144 --> 00:24:53,512
I once interrupted the client

477
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:56,182
during a presentation for Lucky Strike,
our biggest account.

478
00:24:56,216 --> 00:24:57,516
What did you say?

479
00:24:57,551 --> 00:24:59,885
I wasn't supposed
to talk at all.

480
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,588
I knew if I apologized, they'd
never want to work with me again.

481
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:03,889
Why?

482
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:06,158
Do I really
have to explain that?

483
00:25:06,193 --> 00:25:08,960
Not if you don't want to.

484
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:11,429
So the next meeting
I walked in,

485
00:25:11,463 --> 00:25:13,131
shook Lee Garner's hand
and said,

486
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:15,100
"I can't believe you have
the balls to come back

487
00:25:15,134 --> 00:25:17,069
after you embarrassed
yourself like that."

488
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:19,270
Okay.

489
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:21,573
I think I understand.

490
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:24,409
I don't know.
Bring in a bar of soap.

491
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:26,845
Tell them it's there in case you
need to wash your mouth out.

492
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:28,346
Something like that.

493
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,582
Thank you, Don.

494
00:25:41,924 --> 00:25:44,892
This was a big deal.
Four golf courses.

495
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:47,227
Some with estates planned
on the perimeter.

496
00:25:47,262 --> 00:25:48,763
Palos Verdes.

497
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,732
- Is that nice?
- Yes, dear.

498
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:54,735
And all of a sudden, some
hippies come out of the wall

499
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,338
yelling about low-income
housing, killing birds.

500
00:25:58,373 --> 00:26:00,074
Must be real radicals

501
00:26:00,108 --> 00:26:02,943
to prefer low-income
housing to a golf course.

502
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:04,811
Come on, whose side are you on?

503
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:07,113
I just root for the underdog.

504
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:10,550
Well, let's see
how softhearted you are.

505
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:11,751
How about a nightcap?

506
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:13,987
That sounds nice.

507
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:23,262
Where did you
tell him you were?

508
00:26:23,297 --> 00:26:25,331
Who?

509
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:27,801
Tell me the truth.
Are you married?

510
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,504
No.

511
00:26:31,538 --> 00:26:34,039
Please don't lie to me.

512
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:38,711
I have a little boy.

513
00:26:40,414 --> 00:26:41,880
Oh.

514
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:44,950
His name is Kevin
and he's four.

515
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:48,053
Four?
That's a very little boy.

516
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:50,956
Does that make a difference?

517
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:52,992
No.

518
00:26:55,695 --> 00:26:57,463
Can I get the check?

519
00:27:04,638 --> 00:27:06,138
Yes, I'm fine.

520
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:09,274
Um, when do you
expect him back?

521
00:27:12,612 --> 00:27:15,848
But I'm going out of town tomorrow
and I want to say good-bye.

522
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,888
Yes.

523
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,661
Just tell him I'm sorry

524
00:27:29,695 --> 00:27:32,930
and I want
to say good-bye.

525
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:35,433
He has to call me.

526
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:41,906
I'm sorry. I didn't
want to make you cry.

527
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:48,345
Okay.

528
00:27:58,022 --> 00:28:00,291
What are you doing?

529
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:02,326
I want your hands free.

530
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:12,936
Do you mind
if I make a phone call?

531
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,339
I should tell somebody
I'm going to be late.

532
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:21,477
Can I offer you a brandy?

533
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,180
Gin and tonic.

534
00:28:35,158 --> 00:28:37,193
May I have
an outside line, please?

535
00:28:37,228 --> 00:28:39,462
Look at this.
Ice.

536
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:41,997
That's a good hotel.

537
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:53,109
Harris residence.

538
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:54,777
Hello, Maureen.
It's Joan.

539
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:57,446
I wanted to see if you could
stay a few hours longer.

540
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,681
I don't know.

541
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:01,851
It's already
a quarter to 10:00.

542
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:04,053
Well, what did
we say, 11:00?

543
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:05,320
How about 1:00?

544
00:29:05,355 --> 00:29:06,988
I don't know.

545
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:08,957
I kind of have someplace to be.

546
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:12,727
Any chance in persuading you
to stay until midnight?

547
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:16,731
Okay. You know, he had
trouble going to sleep.

548
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:18,833
He said he was afraid
of a cow or something.

549
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:21,335
It's a horse.
Is everything okay now?

550
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,504
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I haven't heard anything.</i>

551
00:29:23,538 --> 00:29:25,106
I'll check on him.

552
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:27,275
Wonderful.
Thanks so much.

553
00:29:30,912 --> 00:29:32,612
You need to go?

554
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,315
No. We have
all the time we need.

555
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:36,984
Or until midnight.

556
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:39,686
I wasn't going
to spend the night

557
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,755
under any circumstances.

558
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,891
It's the kind of woman I am.

559
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:46,326
A woman with a little kid.

560
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,563
Would you rather I was married?

561
00:29:51,598 --> 00:29:53,966
Honey, give me a little bit
of credit for the fact that,

562
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:57,870
well, I could have been a
cad and waited until after

563
00:29:57,905 --> 00:30:00,739
to tell you

564
00:30:00,774 --> 00:30:02,541
I don't like this.

565
00:30:03,643 --> 00:30:04,844
You don't like what?

566
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:06,745
I love kids.

567
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,482
But I raised mine
already and I'm--

568
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,984
I know it sounds selfish.

569
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,320
I mean, I'm done

570
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,054
with that part of my life.

571
00:30:16,088 --> 00:30:18,824
You're being presumptuous.

572
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,293
I know what this is
and so do you.

573
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:23,028
Or you wouldn't have lied.

574
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,665
I can't believe this.

575
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,434
You're such a disappointment.

576
00:30:28,468 --> 00:30:30,902
This is not how I saw things.

577
00:30:30,937 --> 00:30:34,873
I have a plan
which is no plans.

578
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:37,343
You can't go to the pyramids.
You can't go anywhere.

579
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,711
You're right.

580
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:44,983
Nice meeting you.

581
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:09,340
<i>Miss Olson
would like to see you</i>

582
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:11,942
- <i>when you have a moment.</i>
- Send her in.

583
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:21,785
Ted told me I have to fill out
my own performance review.

584
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:23,920
I guess he respects
your opinion.

585
00:31:23,954 --> 00:31:26,790
- I'm tired of this.
- I'd start with that.

586
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:28,958
I'm serious.

587
00:31:28,993 --> 00:31:31,261
I want to have
my performance reviewed.

588
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:33,196
I've had quite a year.

589
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,377
What do you see for the future?

590
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:50,780
Well, um...

591
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:52,281
is that on there?

592
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:54,082
No, I'm just curious.

593
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:59,988
I'd like to be the first woman
creative director at this agency.

594
00:32:01,457 --> 00:32:02,991
That's funny to you?

595
00:32:03,026 --> 00:32:05,560
No, I'm impressed
that you know exactly.

596
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:08,030
What else is there?

597
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:11,433
That's what I'm asking.

598
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:13,768
Let's say you get that.

599
00:32:13,803 --> 00:32:15,437
What's next?

600
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,141
Land something huge.

601
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:23,177
And then?

602
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:26,915
Have a big idea.

603
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:29,317
Create a catchphrase.

604
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:31,719
So you want fame?

605
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:34,722
Yes.

606
00:32:34,757 --> 00:32:37,124
What else?

607
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:40,428
I don't know.

608
00:32:41,963 --> 00:32:43,730
Yes, you do.

609
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:51,738
Create something
of lasting value.

610
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:55,576
In advertising?

611
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,012
This is supposed to be about my
job, not the meaning of life.

612
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:01,381
So you think those things
are unrelated?

613
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:02,883
I didn't know
you'd be in a mood.

614
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,518
Do you want me
to do this or not?

615
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:06,919
Why don't you just write down
all of your dreams

616
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:08,721
so I can shit on them?

617
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:21,267
Where the hell were you?

618
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,904
Good morning to you, too.
I was at class.

619
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:26,838
Why didn't you
mention that last night?

620
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:28,507
Didn't Gail give you
my schedule?

621
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:31,310
You and Gail are quite a team.

622
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,113
She really needed a vacation.

623
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:36,048
I think you need a vacation.

624
00:33:36,082 --> 00:33:39,218
You know what?
You're ruining my life.

625
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,388
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

626
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,159
Bye-bye, sweetie.

627
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:54,598
Anyway, I think
you'll be impressed.

628
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,068
If nothing else, by the speed with
which they turned this around.

629
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:59,837
Well, nice to see you again.

630
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,174
Can't believe you two have
the balls to walk back

631
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,743
into this place after the way
you embarrassed yourselves.

632
00:34:20,107 --> 00:34:22,375
Did you go to the World's Fair?

633
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,410
That's what I think
it's going to look like.

634
00:34:29,249 --> 00:34:30,750
What was your favorite part?

635
00:34:32,687 --> 00:34:34,220
Oh, good.
You're here.

636
00:34:34,254 --> 00:34:36,022
- Can I help you?
- Get out.

637
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,423
What's going on?

638
00:34:37,457 --> 00:34:39,825
I tried your little saying
and I'm off the business.

639
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:41,360
What are you talking about?

640
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:44,730
I made your joke
and it failed miserably.

641
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:46,666
- The soap thing?
- No!

642
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,101
The one where I told them
they were assholes.

643
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,840
You could have thought of
something yourself, you know.

644
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:56,908
I did.
It was apologize.

645
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:59,678
But you don't understand that because
guys like you don't have to do it.

646
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,313
Guys like me know how to do it.

647
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:03,348
Roger tells that
Lucky Strike story, too.

648
00:35:03,382 --> 00:35:07,485
But he says that Lee Garner Jr.
was in love with you.

649
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,255
That you always had to be at the meetings
so he could think about jacking you off.

650
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:12,557
You have a foul mouth.

651
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:15,059
Take responsibility
for your failure.

652
00:35:15,094 --> 00:35:18,229
That account was handed to you and you made
nothing of it because you have no character.

653
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:19,630
You don't have any character.

654
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:21,765
You're just handsome.
Stop kidding yourself.

655
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,138
Everybody has problems.

656
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:30,374
Some people can deal with them
and some people can't.

657
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:32,376
Look at yourself
because the next thing

658
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,778
you're gonna have to move past
is losing this job.

659
00:35:34,812 --> 00:35:36,280
You're fired.

660
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:39,382
I guess I kind of assumed that
when I walked in here.

661
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,718
I just knew
I shouldn't apologize.

662
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:52,629
- Is everything all right?
- Shut the door for me.

663
00:36:01,138 --> 00:36:03,072
<i>There's a Jim
McCloud here to see you.</i>

664
00:36:03,106 --> 00:36:04,974
<i>He's waiting in the lounge.</i>

665
00:36:16,153 --> 00:36:17,519
What are you doing here?

666
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:24,559
Well, thank you so much.

667
00:36:24,594 --> 00:36:27,329
I'm a heel, okay?

668
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,833
No, it's my fault.

669
00:36:31,867 --> 00:36:34,436
I thought about it and
I'm sending my son away.

670
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,639
- What?
- No, I thought about what you said.

671
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:40,240
And I like you, too.
And if I have to choose

672
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:43,844
between you and my son,
I choose you.

673
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:45,446
That's not what I said.

674
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,782
That's exactly what you said.

675
00:36:47,816 --> 00:36:49,417
Well, I've thought about it

676
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:51,519
and I want to be
a part of your life.

677
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:55,222
And your little boy, too.

678
00:36:57,693 --> 00:36:59,827
I live with my mother.

679
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:02,963
And I've been divorced twice.

680
00:37:02,997 --> 00:37:05,799
I'm buying some property
in New York.

681
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:07,434
Where do you live?

682
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:09,870
12th Street.

683
00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:13,373
Okay, I'm not gonna
buy property down there.

684
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:15,709
But...

685
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:17,577
I'm gonna get a place
in a nice neighborhood

686
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,812
near the park
and you're gonna visit.

687
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:21,647
All of you.

688
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:24,150
We'll see.

689
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:26,652
I don't want to be rigid.

690
00:37:26,686 --> 00:37:28,687
It makes you old.

691
00:37:32,226 --> 00:37:34,560
Can I call you?

692
00:37:34,594 --> 00:37:36,262
Okay.

693
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,337
<i>I got it.</i>

694
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,449
Hello.

695
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:02,152
Oh, hello.

696
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:04,422
Loretta let me in
on her way out.

697
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:06,357
I didn't want to surprise you.

698
00:38:07,925 --> 00:38:10,193
No, that's fine.

699
00:38:10,227 --> 00:38:12,228
You know Sally's not here.

700
00:38:12,263 --> 00:38:14,431
I know.

701
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:18,167
Can I get something to drink?

702
00:38:18,202 --> 00:38:20,504
Of course.

703
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:22,205
What do you have in mind?

704
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,541
How about that beer?

705
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:36,552
Do you want to sit down?

706
00:38:36,586 --> 00:38:38,221
No.

707
00:38:45,396 --> 00:38:47,263
They have beer over there.

708
00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:51,066
From what I read
in the magazines,

709
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,968
they have all
the comforts of home.

710
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:58,340
Sally's mad.
My mother's mad.

711
00:38:58,374 --> 00:38:59,975
But you're not.

712
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:03,245
They're afraid for you.

713
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:05,647
I am, too, honestly.

714
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:08,050
But you understand
why I'm doing it.

715
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:10,751
Do you want me
to say that I like it?

716
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:14,355
I know you do because I'm
brave and I love this country

717
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:17,291
and I want to protect it
and everyone in it.

718
00:39:17,326 --> 00:39:19,226
Glen.

719
00:39:22,597 --> 00:39:24,765
I know something
could happen to me.

720
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:27,435
But I feel safe
because I know you're mine.

721
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:32,305
Glen, stop.

722
00:39:35,309 --> 00:39:37,077
Why?

723
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,481
Because I'm married.

724
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,958
I'm sorry.

725
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,827
It's okay.

726
00:39:54,862 --> 00:39:56,429
I understand.

727
00:39:56,464 --> 00:39:58,431
You don't.

728
00:39:58,466 --> 00:40:00,967
Well, I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

729
00:40:01,002 --> 00:40:03,603
This was gonna be the good thing
that came out of all this.

730
00:40:03,637 --> 00:40:05,105
This is all I thought about.

731
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,739
Glen.

732
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:08,674
I know you know me.

733
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:10,743
I know you know
the man I can be.

734
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:17,182
Glen, please don't tell me
that you did this for me.

735
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:19,385
I couldn't live with myself.

736
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:23,389
It's so much worse.

737
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,458
What?

738
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:30,062
I flunked out.

739
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:32,197
Oh, no.

740
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:35,366
My stepdad knew
I was doing bad.

741
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:38,436
He was gonna kill me.
Kick me out.

742
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,772
After I told him,

743
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:43,307
he was so proud.

744
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:45,644
Everything was
peaches and cream.

745
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,237
You're going to make it.

746
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,773
I'm positive.

747
00:41:35,317 --> 00:41:37,518
Don't let me fill up on these.

748
00:41:37,553 --> 00:41:40,688
The bus leaves at 8:30.
Will the food come in time?

749
00:41:40,723 --> 00:41:42,590
They must have run
out of stray cats.

750
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:45,393
You're so funny.

751
00:41:45,427 --> 00:41:47,194
He always says that.

752
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:49,029
It's still funny.

753
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:50,697
What place are you
most excited about?

754
00:41:50,732 --> 00:41:54,268
Washington DC. We're going
to the floor of the Senate.

755
00:41:54,302 --> 00:41:55,602
To protest?

756
00:41:55,636 --> 00:41:58,638
No, we're getting a tour
from Senator Dodd.

757
00:41:58,673 --> 00:42:01,541
We're going to find
an office for Carol.

758
00:42:01,576 --> 00:42:02,809
You want to work there one day?

759
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:04,711
I want to be a senator.

760
00:42:04,746 --> 00:42:07,481
That's impressive.
Good for you.

761
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:09,449
I don't know what I want to be.

762
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:11,885
You'll figure it out.
What are your interests?

763
00:42:13,087 --> 00:42:15,321
I guess I just want
to live in New York.

764
00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:17,790
I want to be
a translator at the UN.

765
00:42:17,824 --> 00:42:19,759
Yolanda's father is a diplomat.

766
00:42:19,793 --> 00:42:23,062
I'm so tired of people
asking me what I want to do.

767
00:42:23,097 --> 00:42:25,498
Well, if you're lucky
enough to think of it,

768
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:27,066
you should write it down.

769
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:28,868
Because when you get older,
you're gonna forget.

770
00:42:30,704 --> 00:42:32,872
Did you write down advertising?

771
00:42:32,907 --> 00:42:35,341
I didn't know
what advertising was.

772
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:37,376
But I wanted to be
in New York City, too.

773
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:42,480
So, where do you live, Don?

774
00:42:42,515 --> 00:42:45,150
Where do I live?
The Upper East Side.

775
00:42:47,153 --> 00:42:48,620
In a penthouse?

776
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:50,655
As a matter of fact, yes.

777
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:54,192
But he grew up very poor.

778
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:56,728
And now you have a penthouse.

779
00:42:58,298 --> 00:43:00,399
- May I?
- Sure.

780
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,902
When I watch television,

781
00:43:03,936 --> 00:43:06,003
the commercials
are my favorite part.

782
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:15,179
So what do you want to do?

783
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:17,515
I just want to eat dinner.

784
00:43:19,652 --> 00:43:21,419
Nothing like having
realistic goals.

785
00:43:30,996 --> 00:43:33,364
- Good-bye, Mr. Draper.
- Bye.

786
00:43:33,398 --> 00:43:35,232
Thanks for dinner.

787
00:43:37,035 --> 00:43:38,836
Sally.

788
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,171
- I'll wave from the bus.
- Hold on a second.

789
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:46,577
It's okay to be nervous
about going away.

790
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:49,580
You can't control
yourself, can you?

791
00:43:49,614 --> 00:43:51,247
What are you talking about?

792
00:43:51,282 --> 00:43:53,584
Sarah is 17, you know.

793
00:43:54,986 --> 00:43:56,353
I'm well aware of that, Sally.

794
00:43:56,387 --> 00:43:58,589
But it doesn't stop you.

795
00:43:58,623 --> 00:44:00,823
And it doesn't stop Mom.

796
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:04,294
Anyone pays attention
to either of you,

797
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:06,529
and they always do,

798
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:09,265
and you just ooze everywhere.

799
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,401
Your friend's
a fast girl, Sally.

800
00:44:11,435 --> 00:44:12,902
I didn't want to embarrass her.

801
00:44:12,936 --> 00:44:16,072
You know what I'm gonna
write down for my dream?

802
00:44:16,107 --> 00:44:19,842
I want to get on the bus and
get away from you and Mom

803
00:44:19,877 --> 00:44:22,979
and hopefully be a different
person than you two.

804
00:44:23,014 --> 00:44:25,014
Hey.

805
00:44:25,048 --> 00:44:27,149
I'm your father.

806
00:44:27,183 --> 00:44:29,886
And you may not want
to listen to this,

807
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,121
but you are like
your mother and me.

808
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:33,823
You're gonna find that out.

809
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:38,027
You're a very beautiful girl.

810
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:41,330
It's up to you
to be more than that.

811
00:45:09,992 --> 00:45:12,593
Bobby, Gene, get back here.

812
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,328
It's time for bed.

813
00:45:15,363 --> 00:45:18,065
I want to watch
"The Brady Bunch."

814
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:21,234
Fine.

815
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:23,270
Give me that.

816
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:45,992
Hello?

817
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:48,361
Oh, um...

818
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:50,297
This will just take a minute.

819
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,104
It's done.
I did it.

820
00:45:58,138 --> 00:46:00,339
I don't know how,
but they're signing.

821
00:46:00,373 --> 00:46:02,075
Right now?

822
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:04,510
Asking price.
30-day escrow.

823
00:46:04,544 --> 00:46:06,512
Really?

824
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:08,915
Now we have to find
a place for you.
