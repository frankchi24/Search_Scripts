00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:47,612
Hello!

3
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,398
Hi, Mom.

4
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,983
- You want me to do that?
- In gloves?

5
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,202
The blender was broken
at the diner.

6
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:56,655
And you wouldn't dare
deprive them of dessert.

7
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,208
You look swanky.
Fundraising?

8
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:02,043
Much better.

9
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,796
We had dinner with the dean
of Fairfield University.

10
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:08,083
Some distant Rockefeller.

11
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,136
Actually, I'm planning
on enrolling in the fall.

12
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,804
Master's degree.

13
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,006
Really?
In what?

14
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:17,926
Psychology.

15
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:21,730
I know it's beyond
your experience,

16
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:23,398
but people love to talk to me.

17
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,852
They seek me out
to share their confidences.

18
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,354
It should be fascinating
for everyone involved.

19
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,860
Oh, hello, Don.

20
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:36,862
We're making chocolate shakes.

21
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:41,917
I should go.

22
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:43,285
Don't rush off.

23
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,536
You can finish your milk shake.

24
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,955
Make Henry one.

25
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,374
You give him a sip of yours.

26
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:51,760
Bye-bye.

27
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:53,678
Maybe I'll make my own.

28
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:58,266
Did you have fun?

29
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:14,783
- Hello?
- Oh, you're home.

30
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,169
I was expecting the service.

31
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,954
I just walked in.

32
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,706
Well, I wanted to let you
know that the movers

33
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,175
are gonna come on Wednesday
to pick up my furniture.

34
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,177
What time you want me
to be there?

35
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,878
<i>Just tell the doorman.</i>

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,348
We're coming at 10:00.
Does that give you enough time?

37
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,683
You know what time
I go to work.

38
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,687
There's one other thing.
It's the 24th already.

39
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,056
How could you be out of money?

40
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,859
Well, between the movers
and the flight--

41
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,445
Why am I explaining
myself to you?

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,230
I'm tired of asking
for an allowance.

43
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:47,199
Can we just sign the papers
and be done with this?

44
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,734
Your lawyer is very aggressive.

45
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:51,203
That's not how I heard it.

46
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,121
I'm starting to think
you're enjoying this.

47
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:56,241
Well, my finances are a mess
since the McCann deal.

48
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,077
You were a millionaire
when I met you.

49
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:02,331
Just tell your lawyer he won.
I'll sign whatever you want.

50
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,582
I can't live like this.

51
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,718
This is what they do, honey.

52
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,253
How much do you need right now?

53
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:09,421
I'll leave a check.

54
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,057
500.

55
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,176
Who's moving you,
the New York Jets?

56
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:17,729
I have to go.

57
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,485
<i>I'm ready, Caroline.</i>

58
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,692
- What's she doing here?
- It's too much.

59
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:33,495
- I can't do it by myself.
- Well, you should have asked me.

60
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,831
You're too busy.
Sit down, Shirley.

61
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:40,585
Well, this morning,
immediately following this,

62
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,338
you have a meeting
with Mr. Campbell and Mr. Torkelson

63
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:45,791
- regarding Lester Chapman.
- Who's he?

64
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:47,125
Secor Laxatives.

65
00:03:47,177 --> 00:03:49,461
I'm sorry, but actually,
he's at Life Cereal.

66
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,797
This is working out already.

67
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,715
They want to set
a call for 4:00.

68
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,634
Hold on a second.
Isn't he NAC?

69
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,386
I'll check the Rolodex.

70
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,970
I'm sorry, what's NAC?

71
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:00,472
No afternoon calls.

72
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:02,357
Lester's blotto after lunch.

73
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:04,976
- He is indeed.
- Well, let's call him now.

74
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:16,321
So it's 798...

75
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,373
Well, this certainly
is a two-man job.

76
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:20,992
3...

77
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:24,045
So you just fly to Los Angeles
for the weekend?

78
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:25,497
Isn't that tiring?

79
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:27,416
What's tiring
is coming back here.

80
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,217
So beautiful.
You should go sometime.

81
00:04:29,253 --> 00:04:31,553
I don't know if I'd like it.

82
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:33,255
How do you go to sleep at night

83
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,757
knowing that the Manson
brothers could be running around?

84
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,476
Good morning.

85
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,761
- The Manson family.
- Are they coming in?

86
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,314
No. A quick word?

87
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,849
Coffee.

88
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,021
So, I got a strange phone call.

89
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,524
Well, not strange,
but unexpected.

90
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,026
- Megan called me.
- Really?

91
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:57,329
I guess she's coming into town
and she wants to buy me a drink

92
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:58,780
to see if I can help her
find a new agent.

93
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,365
Can you?

94
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:01,867
Of course I can.
I do it all the time.

95
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,286
It's just, well,
I wanted to let you know.

96
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:06,788
Been down this road before
and you always find out.

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,623
Because you always tell me.

98
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,342
Yes, but she didn't want me to.

99
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,260
It's never stopped you before.

100
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:14,179
So should I meet with her?

101
00:05:15,557 --> 00:05:16,880
She's not my wife
any more, Harry.

102
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,435
<i>You have a call from a Nicholas</i>

103
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:24,022
<i>Constan...tin...opolis.</i>

104
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,975
- Probably Greek.
- Oh, yes.

105
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,611
- I need to take this.
- I'm sure that's a story.

106
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:34,616
Nicholas, it's Don.

107
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:38,954
Good evening.

108
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:40,455
Can I get you
something from the bar?

109
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:42,407
Are you expecting...

110
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,826
Hello.

111
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,246
How are you?

112
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,550
I'm surprised.

113
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,669
This isn't a coincidence.
I was looking for you.

114
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,005
What do you want?

115
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,424
I want to eat dinner with you.

116
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,393
Even if it's five minutes
at a time.

117
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:02,894
No.

118
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,600
You're making me uncomfortable.

119
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,602
This is my phone number.

120
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:12,604
Call me when you get off work.
I'll meet you somewhere.

121
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,577
I'll show you her work.

122
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,246
You will absolutely
recognize it. Ed!

123
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,915
All I'm saying is you dug
pretty deep to find a woman.

124
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,751
Do you know where
Samantha Ryan's portfolio is?

125
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,036
She calls herself Pima.

126
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:32,257
- Pima Ryan?
- Exactly.

127
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,959
She came and spoke at RISD
when I was there.

128
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:36,044
She's a very sexy lady.

129
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,963
I thought you were queer.

130
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:39,598
Where's Pima's portfolio?

131
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,182
I took it home.

132
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,634
Does she want it back?
Does she need it?

133
00:06:42,686 --> 00:06:44,135
No, I need it.

134
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:46,521
Peggy forgot this
is my account, too.

135
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:49,057
We're really lucky.
She's never done an ad.

136
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,977
Stan, I'm sorry,
but you do not have any of the qualities

137
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:55,447
that either I or Cinzano are looking for
other than being cheaper.

138
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,233
You know, it's hard
to keep my balls at this job.

139
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,285
Ed, what do you know
about vermouth?

140
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,904
No.

141
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,543
Hello?

142
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:10,745
Hello.
It's Diana.

143
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,831
You know, the waitress.

144
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,670
I'm glad you called.
I didn't think you were gonna.

145
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,222
I don't know anybody
in New York.

146
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:23,808
So strange to see
somebody that I know.

147
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,095
Just pleased you're not cross.

148
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:29,648
I was pretty mad.

149
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,017
How did you find me?

150
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,186
Are you a private detective?
You kind of look like one.

151
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:38,023
Why don't we have a drink?

152
00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:40,025
I've already got one.

153
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:42,110
Let's talk now.

154
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,863
I waited a little,

155
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:47,115
maybe too long,

156
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,751
and you were gone.

157
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:51,503
So I told Nick at the diner

158
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,006
to let me know
if you ever came back.

159
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:58,009
I went home.

160
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,511
Where's home?

161
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:03,264
Racine, Wisconsin.

162
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,467
I had to get a divorce.

163
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,353
I'm divorced.

164
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,855
Well, I happen to be
in the same boat.

165
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:15,360
Right now I'm in the boat.

166
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:17,946
I must have known that.

167
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:20,482
Come over.

168
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,234
Where are you?

169
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:25,453
I'm at work.

170
00:08:25,489 --> 00:08:27,906
I don't have a phone yet.

171
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,492
Fine, I'll come there.

172
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,923
Welcome.

173
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,644
Do you sleep like that?

174
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,262
I'm vain.

175
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,932
May I?

176
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,019
It's a very lovely apartment.

177
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,105
It's like
"Architectural Digest."

178
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,441
My...

179
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,028
She decorated it.

180
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,164
It's what I pictured.

181
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,282
So you were picturing it?

182
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:14,285
I took a cab to some
stranger's apartment

183
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:16,504
with $6 in my pocket.

184
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,923
I was hoping it was like this.

185
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,511
I'm gonna sell it.

186
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:27,966
I was just apartment hunting.
It's going to be hard to beat.

187
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,768
Can I fix you a drink?

188
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:34,773
I don't know how I feel
about getting to know you better.

189
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,524
It's 3:00 in the morning.

190
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,227
You know why you're here.
Do you want a drink or not?

191
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,983
I'm already drunk.

192
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,788
Would you like
a glass of water?

193
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,178
Hey, I can't sleep like this.

194
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,184
You were.

195
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,019
I don't want to.

196
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,272
Do you want to go?

197
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,861
No.

198
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,707
Are you really divorced?

199
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:45,710
Yes, I am.

200
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,846
Really. Why?

201
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:52,050
Got a lot of coats
in that closet.

202
00:10:52,102 --> 00:10:55,053
She lives in California.
She didn't need them.

203
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,604
Do you want one?

204
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:00,775
I was going to go
to San Francisco.

205
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,393
I flipped a coin.

206
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,365
I always wanted to live here.

207
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,702
It was in all the movies,
all the magazines.

208
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,037
I haven't seen any of it.

209
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,706
It's a great city.

210
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,324
How long were you married?

211
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,411
12 years.

212
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,415
I don't know why
I thought it'd be easy.

213
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,334
It's never easy.

214
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:29,804
I've been through it before.

215
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,923
There's no children this time.

216
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:33,758
You?

217
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,844
No children.

218
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,156
You smell incredible.
What is that?

219
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,991
Shampoo.

220
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,946
Avon.

221
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,786
I bought it in my living room.

222
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:07,959
In my ranch house.

223
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,347
My two-car garage.

224
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:28,062
Diana?

225
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,068
They're here
every other weekend.

226
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,155
Well, not my little girl. She's at
boarding school, but the boys come.

227
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,588
Are you okay?

228
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,807
No.

229
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,765
What's wrong?

230
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:06,651
I lied to you.

231
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,519
Already?

232
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,659
No, I left home because
I have a little girl.

233
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,945
I had a little girl.

234
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:20,498
Oh.

235
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:26,004
I'm so--
I'm so sorry.

236
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,705
Yes.

237
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,542
When?

238
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,713
Two years ago.

239
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,266
The flu.
Can you imagine?

240
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:41,552
I'm so sorry.

241
00:13:45,108 --> 00:13:47,141
I don't want to talk about it.

242
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,561
Obviously,
I'm in New York City.

243
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,867
You should go.

244
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,287
It's my house.

245
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,041
Don't you have to
get ready for work?

246
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,333
I don't feel like it.

247
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,401
Gentlemen, I'm going
to be strict,

248
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,487
but this is Torkelson's law.

249
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,439
Take a good look.

250
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,275
You got your models,
you got your bottles.

251
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,777
If you make it to lunch
without bothering anybody,

252
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:41,913
we'll let you have
whichever you want.

253
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,917
Ah, well, if you'll
all excuse me.

254
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,788
Come on, I'll introduce you.

255
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,175
Pima Ryan, this is our
art director Stan Rizzo.

256
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,462
So you'll be cutting up
my work, will you?

257
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,715
Well, I try
to treat it like art

258
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,967
even though it's just
selling something.

259
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,186
All art is selling something.

260
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:08,106
No, we're actually
selling something.

261
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,807
Today it's vermouth.

262
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,060
I apologize the models
have so many teeth.

263
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,945
I know you're not used to that.

264
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Pleasure to meet you.

265
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,952
I'm sorry about that.

266
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:24,455
He has a hard time
with... new people.

267
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:26,958
No, he hates himself.

268
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,627
I don't think so.
He's got a huge ego.

269
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,163
And he's a photographer.

270
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:35,166
Ah, men like him
don't bother me.

271
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:37,001
And they shouldn't
bother you either.

272
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:38,719
Look at all you're doing here.

273
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:40,755
Just my job.

274
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,258
Good morning, girls.

275
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,344
Could you take your places?

276
00:15:58,108 --> 00:16:00,658
- Good morning.
- It's 11:30.

277
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,493
Where were you?
I was worried.

278
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,246
- I was sleepy.
- Mr. Sterling's in there.

279
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,031
He's not to be disturbed.

280
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:12,286
Who are you hiding from?

281
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,089
Got two secretaries
and three telephones.

282
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,875
I feel like Marlin Perkins
is chasing me on the savannah.

283
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:20,428
- Hiding is pointless.
- I've got work to do.

284
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:22,213
That's the other
reason I'm here.

285
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,348
McCann represents Derby Foods.

286
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,766
Peter Pan Peanut Butter.

287
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:27,935
- They're making a cookie.
- Sounds delicious.

288
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:29,804
McCann also represents Nabisco.

289
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,556
National Biscuit Company.

290
00:16:31,608 --> 00:16:33,391
They got the word cookie
in their name.

291
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:36,027
No, they don't.
Do we have a shot at Derby?

292
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,528
No, it's just a cookie.

293
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,564
McCann's clients are our clients.
We're helping out.

294
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,566
You and Peter are taking them
golfing tomorrow.

295
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,484
I can't make it.

296
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,120
<i>There's a messenger
here from your attorney's office.</i>

297
00:16:46,156 --> 00:16:48,456
<i>He needs your signature.</i>

298
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,208
So why can't you go golfing?

299
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:52,827
Since Burt Peterson's
the account man.

300
00:16:58,468 --> 00:16:59,884
Good news or bad news?

301
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,720
Good news.
It's almost over.

302
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:06,174
Well, don't settle until
you get the number you want.

303
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,675
Take it from me,
no matter what she says,

304
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,227
you have given her
the good life.

305
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,928
She would never have had it.

306
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,430
Megan is not Jane.

307
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:15,850
So she never said you squandered
her youth and beauty?

308
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,435
Used up her childbearing years?

309
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,153
Thwarted her career?
What career?

310
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,821
She's a consumer.

311
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,940
<i>Mr. Sterling,
are you still at lunch?</i>

312
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,442
<i>They're wondering.</i>

313
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,776
She made her choices.

314
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:39,830
You're very good.

315
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,533
Can I help you?

316
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:47,003
Well, I've been told that my
negatives belong to the agency

317
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,706
and therefore processing
has to be done at your lab.

318
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,675
I'm not comfortable with that.

319
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,211
I hate to break it to you,

320
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,012
but it's not really
yours anymore.

321
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,932
Don't you have a darkroom here?

322
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,434
Yes, but I can't do that.

323
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:05,305
I started off as a clerk

324
00:18:05,357 --> 00:18:08,108
with a newspaper in Sarasota.

325
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:10,527
All I wanted was to get
in that darkroom.

326
00:18:10,562 --> 00:18:14,614
It's a nice thing to have,
especially in the city.

327
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,068
So, you're a photographer.

328
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,371
I do everything.

329
00:18:21,406 --> 00:18:23,039
I'm an art director.

330
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:26,042
You must show me your work.

331
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:28,211
I don't know.

332
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:33,383
I can feel the tension
of your need for my opinion.

333
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:39,422
I wouldn't mind
you taking a look

334
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:41,841
if you promise to be honest.

335
00:18:41,894 --> 00:18:44,177
Let's see how brave you are.

336
00:18:49,318 --> 00:18:51,268
Hello?

337
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,603
Mother?
Marie-France?

338
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:55,438

353
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:19,273
For you to enjoy
and for him to pay for.

354
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:21,093
I'm not changing rooms.

355
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,358
Well, she's made plans for us.

356
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,400

357
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,836
_

358
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:28,620
Absolutely not.
This isn't a vacation.

359
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:30,857
_

360
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:35,387
_

361
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:37,929
We'll have a contest.

362
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:40,715
We'll see if we can get
drunker than Maman.

363
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:47,348
_

364
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,144
<i>- Evening, Doctor.</i>
<i>- Can you hold that?</i>

365
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:58,950
Oh, hello, Don.

366
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:00,735
Hello, Arnold.

367
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:08,326
- Good evening.
- This is Diana.

368
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:10,662
- Arnold and Sylvia.
- Hello.

369
00:20:12,048 --> 00:20:14,465
Brought the whole
restaurant home, did you?

370
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,470
You're not on call, are you?

371
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,974
Mitchell's CO got married.

372
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:26,678
The girl, very young
but very homely.

373
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:29,898
Good night.

374
00:20:31,768 --> 00:20:33,768
Don, we should play
squash sometime.

375
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,104
You know, if you have
the energy.

376
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:38,156
<i>- Arnold!</i>
- Sounds like fun.

377
00:20:42,445 --> 00:20:44,696
How many girls have you
had in this elevator?

378
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,283
That's not what that was.

379
00:20:51,788 --> 00:20:53,504
<i>Hello?</i>

380
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,041
I said hello.
You didn't even grunt.

381
00:20:59,462 --> 00:21:02,547
Are you in a creative mood
or a bad mood?

382
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,466
I don't know what I'm doing.

383
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:07,969
Everything good I have
is from a long time ago.

384
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,938
So what?

385
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:11,723
You think Picasso
looks at "Guernica"

386
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:13,641
and says, "Ignore that.
It was a long time ago"?

387
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,446
I got nothing to show her.

388
00:21:18,481 --> 00:21:20,448
Who cares about her?

389
00:21:21,651 --> 00:21:23,901
You should see what she does.

390
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:27,121
It's so sensual.

391
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:30,908
Get your camera.

392
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,160
Why?

393
00:21:32,212 --> 00:21:34,629
I want you to take my picture.

394
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:36,464
No, you don't.

395
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:37,915
No touching the model.

396
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,417
In here?

397
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,252
I'm not going outside.

398
00:22:01,491 --> 00:22:03,274
You must sit out there
all the time.

399
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:06,527
I want to see where you live.

400
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,004
How could I be
nervous at this point?

401
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,790
I know.

402
00:22:18,842 --> 00:22:21,959
There's a twinge in my chest.

403
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:26,464
A pain?

404
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:29,267
No, it's not that.

405
00:22:29,302 --> 00:22:31,769
I'm positive.

406
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:35,473
Are you hungry?

407
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:38,059
Not really.

408
00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:01,082
Hello?

409
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:06,921
Oh, of course.

410
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:10,174
Yes.

411
00:23:10,176 --> 00:23:12,343
Thank you, Meredith.

412
00:23:15,231 --> 00:23:18,149
Everything okay?

413
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:19,734
I--

414
00:23:21,438 --> 00:23:22,987
We have to get out of here.

415
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:27,742
She's coming to take her things
and I don't want to be here.

416
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:29,744
Oh.

417
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:31,829
- Okay.
- No, look.

418
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:33,448
What?

419
00:23:35,835 --> 00:23:40,004
I think if I were you,
this would bother me.

420
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,374
And it shouldn't
because it's almost over.

421
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:46,928
Good.

422
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:56,637
I want to see you tonight.

423
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:02,610
At my place, okay?

424
00:24:03,646 --> 00:24:05,446
Let's go.

425
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,988
Shit.

426
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,490
We'll swing by
your place on the way.

427
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:17,792
- I'll rent.
- You're going to rent pants?

428
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:20,461
I'll throw my tie over my
shoulder and roll up my sleeves.

429
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:23,131
- They'll love it.
- Probably will.

430
00:24:27,137 --> 00:24:29,086
_

431
00:24:29,695 --> 00:24:32,142
_

432
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:36,429
_

433
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,573
_

434
00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:41,348
_

435
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:43,185
_

436
00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:46,521
What's the difference now?

437
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:48,401
_

438
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,403
_

439
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,756
_

440
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:54,358
_

441
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:56,525
_

442
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:58,249
Stop it this minute.

443
00:24:58,284 --> 00:25:00,952
I have to go change for lunch.

444
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:05,790
It's $200 including the tip.

445
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:11,933
_

446
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,599
- He gave me a check for $500.
- Like a whore?

447
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,743
_

448
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:22,420
_

449
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,181
_

450
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:26,608
_

451
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,897
In the States,
it's the 20th century.

452
00:25:29,949 --> 00:25:31,282
People get divorced
all the time.

453
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:34,619
Exactly.
You can still get an annulment.

454
00:25:34,654 --> 00:25:36,454
I'm not like you.

455
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:38,656
I don't spend my whole life
feeling ashamed.

456
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:40,150
_

457
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,210
Marie-France,
don't be a bitch.

458
00:25:42,245 --> 00:25:44,745
I am not a servant here
to wait on her

459
00:25:44,797 --> 00:25:46,581
while she goes for lunch.

460
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,716
I know you don't
understand this,

461
00:25:48,751 --> 00:25:50,167
but it's for my career.

462
00:25:51,504 --> 00:25:53,304
Good luck with
your bright future.

463
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:56,674
Wait.

464
00:25:56,675 --> 00:25:59,721
_

465
00:25:59,722 --> 00:26:01,422
_

466
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:02,980
No.

467
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:06,594
_

468
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:11,500
_

469
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:16,494
It's not much.
It's just the boxes,

470
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:19,363
Granny's cabinet,
that chair, and the mirror.

471
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:21,866
Go. Have fun.

472
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:24,035
I'll take care of this.

473
00:26:24,036 --> 00:26:26,414
_

474
00:26:33,129 --> 00:26:35,546
Hey, where's everybody going?

475
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:38,382
Oh, my mother's here.
Thank you so much.

476
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:49,300
Do you have to smoke in here?

477
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:51,185
It's taking my mind
off your driving.

478
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:55,189
I don't know why we couldn't
swing by your apartment.

479
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:57,191
What will the clients think
that you're renting clubs?

480
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:59,360
I'll buy a set in the shop.

481
00:27:00,864 --> 00:27:03,314
Megan's moving
her things today.

482
00:27:04,984 --> 00:27:07,118
I didn't know that
was still going on.

483
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:12,623
They want to punish you.

484
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,376
And then you get mad
and you want to punish them,

485
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:16,911
but you know it's your fault.

486
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:20,331
I've been through it before.

487
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,884
Well, how did you handle
client dinners?

488
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,969
I got a date.

489
00:27:25,004 --> 00:27:28,172
I don't have a steady,
so it's too unpredictable.

490
00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:29,674
You don't know how much
they're going to drink

491
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:31,092
and suddenly
you're with a floozy.

492
00:27:31,144 --> 00:27:33,061
Golf is better.

493
00:27:33,096 --> 00:27:35,179
Jiminy Christmas.

494
00:27:35,181 --> 00:27:37,815
You think you're going to begin
your life over and do it right.

495
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:39,901
But what if you never get
past the beginning again?

496
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:42,270
Watch the road.

497
00:27:46,192 --> 00:27:48,659
You filled the whole truck.
That wasn't what we agreed.

498
00:27:48,695 --> 00:27:50,411
I told you
it was gonna be more.

499
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:52,113
More than double?

500
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:53,698
Fine, how much you got?

501
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,117
I have $350.

502
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:58,169
That's enough for me
to leave it on the sidewalk.

503
00:27:58,204 --> 00:28:00,955
That's extortion!

504
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:03,958
Lady, you are a pain in my ass.

505
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:09,547
Donald Draper's office.

506
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,549
I need to speak
with him immediately.

507
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:13,101
It's Marie Calvet.

508
00:28:13,136 --> 00:28:16,020
Well, I'm sorry, he's not
available right now.

509
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:17,472
Interrupt him.

510
00:28:17,524 --> 00:28:19,273
I can take a message.

511
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:21,225
May I say what this
is regarding?

512
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:24,061
No.

513
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:28,533
<i>There's a Marie
something on the line.</i>

514
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:30,201
Marie who?

515
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:33,321
I got it.
Get off the line.

516
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:38,292
- <i> Bonjour.</i>
- I am in desperate need of you.

517
00:28:38,328 --> 00:28:40,378
Well, hello to you, too.

518
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:42,330
I need you to come
to Don's apartment

519
00:28:42,382 --> 00:28:46,134
with $200 and not a penny more!

520
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:48,169
Calm down.
I'll send someone.

521
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:51,806
What did I expect? Every time you
get what you want, you run away.

522
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:53,641
Don't say that.

523
00:28:53,676 --> 00:28:55,593
Bring cash!

524
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:02,400
It's fine.

525
00:29:03,937 --> 00:29:05,353
Look where you are.

526
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:12,160
Don't.
I'm not ready.

527
00:29:12,195 --> 00:29:14,362
Your subject certainly is.

528
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:16,914
That's Elaine.
She's...

529
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,950
Overdeveloped?

530
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:24,705
She's not worthy of you.

531
00:29:26,092 --> 00:29:28,092
You can see it in her eyes.

532
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:30,378
She doesn't want
to tell you the truth.

533
00:29:34,517 --> 00:29:37,635
Drawing is a much more
rare talent.

534
00:29:37,637 --> 00:29:39,554
Oh.

535
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:47,478
I expected more.

536
00:30:04,464 --> 00:30:06,163
Holy shit.

537
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:08,165
- What?
- Where is everything?

538
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,301
- On the truck.
- Pay him.

539
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:12,837
180 bucks.

540
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:17,341
My pleasure.

541
00:30:21,347 --> 00:30:22,847
Don agreed to this?

542
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:25,016
He was very generous.

543
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:28,352
And you are a true gentleman.

544
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:30,104
Uh-huh.

545
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:32,240
Let's get out of here.
I'll buy you a drink.

546
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:35,826
I hate what he did
to my daughter.

547
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:37,445
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>
I'm trembling.

548
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,616
You really are.
It's okay.

549
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,703
What are you doing?

550
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,630
You already emptied
the place out.

551
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:56,964
You want to defile it as well?

552
00:30:57,016 --> 00:30:58,849
Please.

553
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:00,801
Take advantage of me.

554
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:13,197
- You look ravishing.
- Thank you.

555
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:15,032
I'm really sorry I'm late.

556
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:16,901
You know that office.

557
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:18,402
Should we get some wine?

558
00:31:18,454 --> 00:31:20,655
I already did.

559
00:31:20,707 --> 00:31:22,907
I am certainly
picking up the check.

560
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:24,575
I insist.

561
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:27,712
It's just you had such good
advice for Miranda and Jill.

562
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:30,081
Well, they didn't
have agents at all.

563
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,300
My advice was get one.

564
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:34,302
Well, whatever you did.

565
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:36,587
To whatever I did.

566
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,176
So, give me the lay.

567
00:31:42,228 --> 00:31:43,678
You know, of the land.

568
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,980
There's not much to tell.

569
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:48,516
I haven't booked anything
in the last few months.

570
00:31:48,568 --> 00:31:50,434
Not even pilot season?

571
00:31:50,436 --> 00:31:53,237
Well, I turned down
some smaller parts

572
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:55,690
because Alan thought they'd take
me out of the running for leads.

573
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:58,159
I'm not in his business,
but I find it hard to believe

574
00:31:58,194 --> 00:32:00,444
that you're losing any contest.

575
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:02,446
I bet he doesn't know
how to get you in one.

576
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:05,366
Well, I read
all the time, Harry.

577
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:06,951
Do you read for lead parts?

578
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:08,786
Because that's just getting
your name on the right list

579
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:10,121
with the right
casting director.

580
00:32:10,123 --> 00:32:11,756
Good agents with
real track records

581
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:13,124
can make that happen.

582
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:16,594
Alan represents
Angie Dickinson.

583
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:19,263
You are every man's fantasy.

584
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:22,299
You're like Ali MacGraw
and Brigitte Bardot had a baby.

585
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:24,769
You should be the most famous
person in the world right now.

586
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:27,555
Oh, my goodness.

587
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:30,057
You should be in this business.

588
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:33,477
I can't believe
Don threw you away.

589
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:38,983
He's not a loyal person,
but I am.

590
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:43,654
You don't think
he could have helped you?

591
00:32:43,706 --> 00:32:46,657
I'm willing to put my money
where my mouth is.

592
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:50,127
It would be much appreciated.

593
00:32:51,631 --> 00:32:53,547
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm not hungry.

594
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,966
I'd rather get to work
on this immediately.

595
00:32:57,587 --> 00:32:59,754
Well, we can work and eat.
I have a pen.

596
00:32:59,806 --> 00:33:01,972
Well, I have a room upstairs.

597
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:06,143
It has a phone.
I could make some calls.

598
00:33:08,514 --> 00:33:10,181
Oh, Harry.

599
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:14,852
I'm not interested.

600
00:33:16,572 --> 00:33:18,823
Megan, you're a big girl.

601
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:23,194
Maybe you're in this situation because
of how you're reacting to this.

602
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:26,997
Hold on.
Forget all that.

603
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:30,034
Come on, have
another glass of wine.

604
00:33:37,543 --> 00:33:39,376
Caroline, I was busy, okay?

605
00:33:39,378 --> 00:33:41,378
Now how about at least
giving me a pat on the back

606
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,963
for remembering
I had a meeting?

607
00:33:43,015 --> 00:33:44,515
<i>Hello?</i>

608
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:48,803
What are you doing here, Megan?

609
00:33:48,855 --> 00:33:50,387
Where the fuck is everything?

610
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:52,189
Roger...

611
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,412
_

612
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:58,446
He came to help me.

613
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:01,282
I should go.

614
00:34:01,317 --> 00:34:03,984
Why are you here?
I told you to go to the hotel.

615
00:34:04,036 --> 00:34:07,988
I felt guilty that I left
you here, but obviously...

616
00:34:07,989 --> 00:34:09,650
_

617
00:34:09,651 --> 00:34:11,974
_

618
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:16,580
I'm late for a meeting.

619
00:34:16,632 --> 00:34:19,834
I guess you don't care that
she's married to my father.

620
00:34:19,886 --> 00:34:21,886
It wasn't my idea.

621
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,090
You don't get to stand
in judgment of me.

622
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:42,903
Could you give us
a second, honey?

623
00:34:51,447 --> 00:34:53,280
No, thank you.

624
00:34:53,282 --> 00:34:55,082
Have you spoken with Megan?

625
00:34:55,118 --> 00:34:56,700
I just walked in.

626
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:59,286
Well, I think I should
warn you, we had lunch

627
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:02,289
and, uh, she's not stable, Don.

628
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:05,292
She said a lot of crazy things and
I'm sure will continue to say them.

629
00:35:05,294 --> 00:35:08,045
And what will
she say about you?

630
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:09,346
Crazy things.

631
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:11,599
All I can say is
she really wants a job.

632
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:13,217
What does that mean?

633
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:15,469
Don, come on, nothing happened.

634
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:17,271
You know she hates me.

635
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:20,891
You know what?
It's none of my business.

636
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:23,227
Well, I don't think I could
have helped her anyway.

637
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:25,146
She quit her soap
and left New York.

638
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:26,447
That was a really dumb idea.

639
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,403
Pima?

640
00:35:34,157 --> 00:35:36,407
Could you come in?
I have the selects.

641
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:40,995
Could you get the door?

642
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:49,970
I put the ones that I like
best on the top row here.

643
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,478
I like this one,
but Stan doesn't.

644
00:35:57,513 --> 00:36:00,181
Stan already
showed these to you?

645
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,233
He was eager to share.

646
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:04,268
But he knows nothing
about women.

647
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,153
What does that mean?

648
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:08,522
It was just his opinion.

649
00:36:10,576 --> 00:36:13,160
Well, mine's the only
opinion that matters here.

650
00:36:13,196 --> 00:36:15,863
- It's my account.
- Of course, you're in charge.

651
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:17,581
I know that.

652
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:20,618
Which one do you like?

653
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:24,338
I think number three.

654
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:26,040
Top row.

655
00:36:30,763 --> 00:36:32,713
You've never been married.

656
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:36,217
Nope.

657
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:38,719
Me either.

658
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:41,305
The adventures
I would have missed.

659
00:36:42,558 --> 00:36:44,225
Number four.

660
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,563
I would love
to take your picture.

661
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:52,233
Well, I'm--

662
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:54,118
I don't know about that.

663
00:36:55,738 --> 00:36:58,405
The way you're looking
at me right now...

664
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:05,913
I would capture that.

665
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:27,651
How are you?

666
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:32,606
Where is he?
He was right behind me.

667
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,530
I don't want anything of yours.

668
00:37:48,424 --> 00:37:50,624
I wasn't going to say a word.

669
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:52,626
I wasn't going to give you
the satisfaction

670
00:37:52,628 --> 00:37:54,962
of knowing that
you ruined my life.

671
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:57,514
Megan.

672
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,100
Why did I believe you?

673
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:05,306
Why did I believe
the things you said to me?

674
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,891
Why am I being punished
for being young?

675
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:12,980
I gave up everything for you
because I believed you.

676
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:14,815
And you're nothing but a liar.

677
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:22,072
An aging, sloppy, selfish liar.

678
00:38:35,004 --> 00:38:36,670
You're right.

679
00:38:36,672 --> 00:38:39,173
You're gonna write me a check?

680
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:42,810
I want you to have

681
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:45,312
the life you deserve.

682
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:54,855
Are you kidding me?

683
00:38:54,907 --> 00:38:56,990
No.

684
00:38:57,026 --> 00:38:59,193
A million dollars?

685
00:38:59,195 --> 00:39:01,445
Why are you doing this to me?
It's not funny.

686
00:39:01,497 --> 00:39:04,198
I don't want to fight anymore.

687
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,750
Well, I know it's not real.

688
00:39:06,786 --> 00:39:08,419
Nothing about you is.

689
00:39:08,454 --> 00:39:11,622
It is real.
Please take it.

690
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,316
Megan, I'm sorry.

691
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:42,236
Send me the papers.

692
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:49,626
I want you to be honest.

693
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:51,628
Should I let my hair grow out?

694
00:39:51,664 --> 00:39:53,130
Good night, everybody.

695
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:55,999
Ed, you were right.
Pima's a treasure.

696
00:39:56,051 --> 00:39:57,835
Is she?

697
00:39:57,887 --> 00:40:00,254
You don't like the work?
Because I was thinking,

698
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:02,756
you know, she'd be right
for Butler Shoes.

699
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:04,808
Or maybe Topaz Pantyhose.

700
00:40:04,844 --> 00:40:06,560
She's got a thing for legs.

701
00:40:06,595 --> 00:40:08,395
Women's legs.

702
00:40:08,431 --> 00:40:10,230
Sorry to disappoint you.

703
00:40:10,266 --> 00:40:13,400
I'm not disappointed.

704
00:40:13,436 --> 00:40:16,019
Neither was she.

705
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:20,574
Really?

706
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:22,276
Does that bother you?

707
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:26,163
No.

708
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:27,998
But I bet it might
bother Ellen.

709
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:29,283
Elaine.

710
00:40:29,285 --> 00:40:31,034
This is none of your business.

711
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:33,620
No.

712
00:40:33,622 --> 00:40:35,622
It's Pima's business,

713
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:38,926
which turns out to be
more advertising than art.

714
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:41,795
She's a hustler.

715
00:40:41,797 --> 00:40:44,131
You're jealous.

716
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:46,216
She tried
the same thing with me.

717
00:40:46,268 --> 00:40:48,469
But she didn't get as far.

718
00:40:48,471 --> 00:40:51,355
And that's why I'm not going
to give her another job.

719
00:40:53,058 --> 00:40:54,892
I don't believe you.

720
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:57,561
Which part?

721
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:13,677
_

722
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:17,456
_

723
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:19,347
_

724
00:41:19,348 --> 00:41:22,101
_

725
00:41:22,975 --> 00:41:24,475
Not particularly.

726
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:28,295
_

727
00:41:28,296 --> 00:41:31,116
_

728
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:34,785
So you ordered room service?

729
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:37,508
_

730
00:41:37,509 --> 00:41:40,267
_

731
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:42,159
I don't care.

732
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,411
She's leaving Papa.

733
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:48,132
I'm going to pack.

734
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:50,606
_

735
00:41:51,514 --> 00:41:53,876
_

736
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:57,007
I don't want to hear about it.

737
00:41:57,698 --> 00:41:59,918
_

738
00:42:00,595 --> 00:42:03,989
_

739
00:42:04,316 --> 00:42:06,016
You know it's a sin
to be a ghoul

740
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:07,684
and feed on everyone's pain?

741
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:13,323
She's been very unhappy
for a very long time.

742
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,359
At least she did
something about it.

743
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:26,036
I'm exhausted.

744
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:29,339
Me, too.

745
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,425
Did you print anything?

746
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,210
They're drying.

747
00:42:33,212 --> 00:42:35,262
You did?

748
00:42:35,297 --> 00:42:37,714
How were they?
What did Pima say?

749
00:42:40,886 --> 00:42:42,719
She loved them.

750
00:42:42,721 --> 00:42:44,688
How about you?

751
00:43:12,218 --> 00:43:15,135
Do you want a drink?
I just have vodka.

752
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:17,421
Yes, please.

753
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:20,557
Oh, I got you something.

754
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:22,259
Open it.

755
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:29,099
It's a New York City guidebook.

756
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,101
Finally start your tour.

757
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:33,654
Go on.

758
00:43:36,525 --> 00:43:39,109
Can't you see
I don't want anything?

759
00:43:42,698 --> 00:43:45,249
Look, I'm pretty sure
I had a worse day than you.

760
00:43:45,284 --> 00:43:46,750
Please don't be in a mood.

761
00:43:46,785 --> 00:43:49,036
I'm not in a mood.

762
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:51,622
And you've never had
a worse day than me.

763
00:43:51,624 --> 00:43:54,208
You don't think
I've felt grief?

764
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,793
You knew that about me
the first night we met.

765
00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:02,683
I've been trying
to talk myself out of it.

766
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:04,468
Don't.

767
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,969
No.

768
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,355
Talk myself out
of what I have to say.

769
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,858
You're scared.
I understand.

770
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:15,028
But I took care
of everything today.

771
00:44:16,649 --> 00:44:18,949
I've been separated
a long time.

772
00:44:21,153 --> 00:44:24,905
You're not the first
thing to come along.

773
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,325
I'm ready.

774
00:44:30,162 --> 00:44:32,963
You're fooling yourself
if you think this'll make a difference.

775
00:44:32,998 --> 00:44:34,831
You don't think I know
what's going on here?

776
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:37,084
Look at this dump.

777
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:39,303
I know you think
you deserve this.

778
00:44:39,338 --> 00:44:40,754
I've done it.

779
00:44:43,475 --> 00:44:45,475
I left my daughter.

780
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:48,228
Stop blaming yourself.

781
00:44:48,264 --> 00:44:50,814
No.

782
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:53,400
I had two children.

783
00:44:53,435 --> 00:44:55,018
Two girls.

784
00:44:56,939 --> 00:44:59,356
One died and one...

785
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:06,747
my oldest is in Racine
with her father.

786
00:45:10,035 --> 00:45:12,536
Why? Don't you want
to ask why?

787
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:16,173
No.

788
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:26,383
I told you about my heart.

789
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:30,554
I don't want to feel
anything else.

790
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:35,025
When I was with you,
I forgot about...

791
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:40,731
her.

792
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:43,817
I don't ever want to do that.

793
