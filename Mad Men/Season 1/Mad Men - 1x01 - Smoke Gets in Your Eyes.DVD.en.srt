{1971}{1995}Old Gold man, huh?
{2042}{2066}Lucky Strike here.
{2117}{2176}Can I ask you a question?|Why do you smoke Old Gold?
{2180}{2233}I'm sorry, sir.|Is Sam here bothering you?
{2253}{2286}He can be|a little chatty.
{2312}{2370}No, we're actually just|having a conversation.
{2371}{2395}Is that okay?
{2419}{2455}Can I get you|another drink?
{2460}{2492}Yeah. Do this again.
{2502}{2530}Old-fashioned, please.
{2586}{2648}So you obviously need to relax|after working here all night.
{2656}{2697}I guess.|I don't know.
{2704}{2738}But what is it?|I mean, low-tar?
{2739}{2792}Those new filters?|Why, I mean, why Old Gold?
{2812}{2857}They gave 'em to us|in the service...
{2857}{2889}a carton a week|for free.
{2898}{2940}So you're used to 'em,|is that it?
{2940}{2964}Yeah.
{2976}{3000}They're a habit.
{3006}{3051}I could never get you|to try another brand...
{3051}{3086}say, my Luckies?
{3117}{3145}I love my Old Golds.
{3178}{3219}All right, well,|let's just say tomorrow
{3219}{3272}a tobacco weevil comes|and eats every last
{3309}{3338}Old Gold on the planet.
{3348}{3372}That's a sad story.
{3392}{3416}It's a tragedy.
{3450}{3485}Would you|just stop smoking?
{3520}{3560}I think I could|find something.
{3574}{3598}I love smoking.
{3630}{3675}"I love smoking. "|That's very good.
{3682}{3706}My wife hates it.
{3714}{3762}Reader's Digest|says it will kill you.
{3795}{3826}Yeah,|I heard about that.
{3856}{3891}Ladies love|their magazines.
{3960}{3983}Yes, they do.
{4733}{4789}You weren't worried|about waking me, were you?
{4803}{4836}Am I interrupting anything?
{4838}{4863}Mmm, no.
{4941}{4983}You're lucky|I'm still up working
{5011}{5035}and I'm all alone.
{5058}{5082}How's it going?
{5107}{5143}They invented|something called
{5143}{5167}Grandmother's Day.
{5182}{5235}That ought to keep me|busy drawing puppies
{5238}{5262}for a few months.
{5300}{5349}Can I run a few ideas|past you?
{5351}{5388}Does that mean what I think it means?
{5389}{5444}Because I'm familiar|with most of your ideas.
{5469}{5530}I'm having a situation|with my cigarette account.
{5540}{5576}You really are here|to talk.
{5612}{5654}The Trade Commission|is cracking down
{5654}{5690}on all of our health claims.
{5692}{5718}I getReader's Digest.
{5738}{5796}This is the same scare|you had five years ago.
{5804}{5828}You dealt with it.
{5837}{5867}I know|I slept a lot better,
{5867}{5895}knowing doctors smoke.
{5918}{5945}Well, that's just it.
{5950}{5998}The whole "safer cigarette"|thing is over.
{6017}{6065}No more doctors,|no more testimonials,
{6068}{6118}no more cough-free,|soothes your T-zone,
{6149}{6192}low-tar, low-nicotine,|filter tip.
{6198}{6222}Nothing.
{6237}{6276}All I have|is a crush-proof box
{6300}{6367}and "four out of five|dead people smoke your brand. "
{6396}{6433}Is this the part|where I say,
{6434}{6468}"Don Draper|is the greatest
{6475}{6525}ad man ever,|"and his big, strong brain
{6562}{6595}will find a way|to lead the sheep
{6595}{6624}to the slaughterhouse"?
{6670}{6718}I don't want to go|to school tomorrow.
{6765}{6799}You gonna pitch to me|or not?
{6799}{6843}Midge, I'm serious.|I have nothing.
{6864}{6912}I am over, and they're|finally gonna know it.
{6913}{6938}Next time you see me,
{6939}{7007}there'll be a bunch of young executives|picking meat off my ribs.
{7019}{7050}That's a pretty picture.
{7120}{7144}What's your secret?
{7207}{7243}Nine different ways|to say...
{7297}{7326}"I love you, Grandma. "
{7809}{7837}We should get married.
{7906}{7949}You think I'd make|a good ex-wife?
{7957}{7981}I'm serious.
{8013}{8047}You have your own business.
{8052}{8092}You don't mind|when I come over.
{8140}{8179}What size Cadillac|do you take?
{8232}{8256}You know the rules.
{8260}{8306}I don't make plans,|and I don't make
{8314}{8338}breakfast.
{8458}{8507}Sterling's having|the tobacco people in
{8507}{8550}in nine hours,|and I have nothing.
{8628}{8653}People love smoking.
{8664}{8723}There's nothing that you,|the Trade Commission,
{8736}{8786}orReader's Digest|can do to change that.
{8950}{9013}There's this kid who comes|by my office every day,
{9023}{9071}looks where he's gonna|put his plants.
{9097}{9121}Is he handsome?
{9635}{9659}23.
{9671}{9695}Uh, not right away.
{9704}{9740}Pal, could you take the long way up?
{9740}{9784}I am really enjoying|the view here.
{9788}{9828}You going to Campbell's|bachelor party?
{9828}{9868}Yeah, I want to be there|before they tie
{9868}{9932}an anchor around his neck|and drag him out to sea.
{9933}{9963}I hear|she's a nice girl.
{9963}{9987}Eh,|who wants that?
{10134}{10165}What did you do that for?
{10165}{10213}She'll probably be|assigned to one of us.
{10213}{10249}Then she'll know|what she's in for.
{10249}{10303}You got to let them know|what kind of guy you are.
{10303}{10346}Then they'll know|what kind of girl to be.
{10346}{10416}I have a feeling we won't be going|to your bachelor party soon.
{10421}{10478}Yeah, well, compared to Campbell,|I'm a Boy Scout.
{10498}{10537}Excuse me.|Is he expecting you?
{10538}{10572}He's not expecting anything.
{10625}{10674}Oh, honey, don't worry.|I'll get home safely.
{10710}{10752}I have an important|appointment right now,
{10753}{10802}so why don't you go|shopping or something?
{10810}{10843}Take your mother to lunch.
{10843}{10873}Tell her it was my idea.
{10885}{10909}Wow. He's good.
{10926}{10967}It's just|a bachelor party, dear.
{10993}{11053}No, I really don't know|what they have planned,
{11060}{11113}but judging from|the creative brain power around here,
{11114}{11158}we'll probably end up|seeing My Fair Lady.
{11218}{11242}I'll tell you what.
{11253}{11298}I'll drop by your place|on my way home.
{11298}{11352}Your mother can check|under my fingernails.
{11380}{11407}Of course I love you.
{11442}{11501}I'm giving up my life|to be with you, aren't I?
{11598}{11622}What a great gal.
{11665}{11711}I tell ya, boys,|she stole my heart.
{11770}{11802}And her old man's|loaded.
{11872}{11909}Now, this is|the executive floor.
{11909}{11956}It should be organized,|but it's not,
{11960}{12002}so you'll find|account executives
{12002}{12060}and creative executives|all mixed in together.
{12067}{12118}- Please don't ask me the difference.|- Great.
{12119}{12185}Hopefully, if you follow my lead,|you can avoid some of the mistakes
{12185}{12211}I've made here.
{12212}{12256}- Hello, Joan.|- Like that one.
{12310}{12384}- So how many trains did it take you?|- Only one, but I got up very early.
{12385}{12428}In a couple of years,|with the right moves,
{12429}{12478}you'll be in the city|with the rest of us.
{12479}{12525}Of course,|if you really make the right moves,
{12526}{12596}you'll be out in the country,|and you won't be going to work at all.
{12620}{12666}You'll be here|just across the aisle from me.
{12666}{12721}We'll both take care of Mr. Draper|for the time being.
{12729}{12765}I don't know what your goals are,
{12765}{12806}but don't overdo it with the perfume.
{12806}{12858}Keep a fifth of something|in your desk.
{12859}{12887}Mr. Draper drinks dry.
{12900}{12965}Also, invest in some|aspirin, Band-Aids,
{12969}{13002}and a needle and thread.
{13020}{13049}Rye is Canadian, right?
{13050}{13075}You better find out.
{13116}{13156}He may act like|he wants a secretary,
{13156}{13207}but most of the time,|they're looking for something
{13209}{13242}between a mother and a waitress.
{13254}{13295}And the rest|of the time, well...
{13430}{13462}Go home,|take a paper bag,
{13462}{13502}and cut some eyeholes|out of it.
{13508}{13546}Put it over your head,|get undressed,
{13546}{13590}and look at yourself|in the mirror.
{13592}{13636}Really evaluate|where your strengths
{13636}{13679}and weaknesses are,|and be honest.
{13706}{13739}I always try to be honest.
{13766}{13790}Good for you.
{13829}{13891}Now, try not to be overwhelmed|by all this technology.
{13892}{13918}It looks complicated,
{13919}{13986}but the men who designed it made it|simple enough for a woman to use.
{13987}{14012}I sure hope so.
{14013}{14061}At lunch, pick up|a box of chocolates,
{14069}{14118}a dozen carnations,|and some bath salts.
{14118}{14169}- I'll explain later.|- Thank you, Miss Holloway.
{14171}{14228}You're really wonderful for looking out|for me this way.
{14240}{14264}It's Joan.
{14276}{14310}And listen,|don't take this
{14343}{14385}the wrong way,|but a girl like you,
{14385}{14427}with those darling|little ankles,
{14430}{14470}I'd find a way|to make 'em sing.
{14518}{14547}Also, men love scarves.
{14571}{14602}Good morning, Mr. Draper.
{14640}{14666}Oh! And Mr. Sterling.
{14673}{14697}How are you?
{14697}{14721}Morning, girls.
{14802}{14852}You look like a hundred bucks.|Long night?
{14863}{14907}It's not this|tobacco thing, is it?
{14909}{14936}It's been on my mind.
{14941}{14977}Yeah, well,|I should hope so.
{14980}{15038}Lee Garner, his father,|the whole Lucky Strike family
{15038}{15062}will be here at 4.
{15092}{15116}You worried?
{15135}{15159}No.
{15166}{15214}If I was worried,|I'd ask you what you've got,
{15215}{15279}but I'm not, so I'm just going to assume|you've got something,
{15281}{15322}which means you should be worried.
{15336}{15402}So you came here because you wanted|to watch me get dressed?
{15422}{15465}No, I wanted to make sure|you were here.
{15465}{15508}In body. Give me|about a half hour
{15513}{15537}for the rest of it.
{15558}{15582}Oh.
{15612}{15636}How do I put this?
{15637}{15673}Have we|ever hired any Jews?
{15700}{15724}Not on my watch.
{15739}{15784}That's very funny.|It's not what I meant.
{15805}{15832}We've got an Italian.
{15841}{15875}Salvatore, my art director.
{15883}{15912}That won't work.|Sorry.
{15935}{15987}Most of the Jewish guys|work for the Jewish firms.
{15987}{16011}Yeah, I know.
{16015}{16059}Selling Jewish products|to Jewish people.
{16059}{16083}That's very good.
{16086}{16143}It's just that our 11:00|is with Menken's Department Store
{16145}{16209}and I wish we had someone to make them|feel... comfortable.
{16220}{16269}Want me to run to the deli|and grab somebody?
{16313}{16338}You missed a button.
{17497}{17528}Ah. Look at you, Gidget.
{17552}{17592}Still trying|to fill out that bikini?
{17595}{17619}Summer's coming.
{17645}{17732}Without the medical claims,|all we have is a white box
{17736}{17779}with a red spot on it.
{17810}{17849}My neighbor posed for that.
{17853}{17913}Believe me, he always|looks very relaxed.
{17931}{17966}Of course,|he doesn't smoke.
{17968}{17996}Had him hold a pencil.
{17997}{18061}If I know these guys, you're better off|with a little sex appeal.
{18061}{18114}Can you give me a woman|in a bathing suit,
{18122}{18149}put her next to your guy?
{18149}{18173}A sexy girl?
{18177}{18203}I can do that.
{18203}{18241}Give you a chance to get a real model.
{18243}{18284}Oh, I love my work.
{18297}{18347}Speaking of sexy girls,|are you going to Pete's
{18347}{18371}bachelor party?
{18378}{18420}I'm not really big|on those things.
{18420}{18444}Tell me about it.
{18452}{18478}It's so embarrassing.
{18482}{18519}If a girl's gonna shake it in my face,
{18520}{18569}I want to be alone|so I can do something.
{18607}{18663}Should we drink before|the meeting or after?
{18676}{18700}Or both?
{18733}{18760}So... that's it, huh?
{18804}{18828}Relax?
{18828}{18857}Don't be short with me.
{18871}{18895}You're the writer.
{18901}{18938}I thought|it was worth a try.
{18963}{19004}Greta Guttman|is here to see you.
{19011}{19048}- Send her in.|- Oh, great.
{19051}{19107}Now we get to hear from|our man in research.
{19180}{19260}Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,|you both seemed more relaxed
{19264}{19288}than I expected.
{19300}{19358}Do you have some kind of surprise|for the tobacco people?
{19368}{19399}I'm doing|my own research.
{19399}{19455}If you're planning to continue with|medical testimony,
{19456}{19518}you'll only be inviting|further government interference.
{19533}{19564}We must police ourselves.
{19566}{19616}- There's your slogan.|- The medical thing is dead.
{19617}{19653}- We understand that.|- Yes, dead.
{19653}{19711}An apt choice of words,|considering the public
{19714}{19768}is convinced|that cigarettes are poisonous.
{19772}{19808}If we can't insist that they're not,
{19810}{19867}I believe my most recent surveys|have provided a solution.
{19868}{19936}We can still suggest that cigarettes|are part of American life,
{19947}{19982}or too good to give up,
{19993}{20042}or, most appealing,|an assertion of independence.
{20045}{20106}So, basically, if you love danger,|you'll love smoking.
{20108}{20161}We can put a skull|and crossbones on the label.
{20161}{20185}I love it.
{20203}{20240}Before the war,|when I studied
{20240}{20283}with Adler in Vienna,|we postulated
{20284}{20330}that what Freud called|the death wish
{20333}{20375}is as powerful a drive|as those for
{20375}{20430}sexual reproduction|and physical sustenance.
{20435}{20459}Freud, you say?
{20471}{20500}What agency is he with?
{20508}{20540}We're supposed|to believe
{20540}{20583}that people are all|living one way
{20589}{20641}and secretly thinking|the exact opposite?
{20654}{20678}That's ridiculous.
{20695}{20736}Let me tell you something,|Miss Guttman...
{20736}{20760}Doctor.
{20774}{20798}Dr. Guttman.
{20811}{20869}Psychology might be great|at cocktail parties,
{20887}{20953}but it so happens that people|were buying cigarettes
{20956}{20984}before Freud was born.
{21004}{21060}The issue here isn't|why should people smoke.
{21060}{21113}It's why should people|smoke Lucky Strike.
{21133}{21182}Suggesting|that our customers have a...
{21192}{21218}What did you call it?
{21219}{21243}A death wish?
{21262}{21309}I just don't see that|on a billboard.
{21311}{21370}So what ifReader's Digest|says they're dangerous?
{21370}{21429}They also saidBambiwas|the book of the century.
{21437}{21461}There's no proof.
{21463}{21508}There's conclusive proof|that none of these
{21508}{21563}low-tar, low-nicotine,|or filtration systems
{21580}{21613}have any effect|on the incidences
{21613}{21637}of lung cancer.
{21649}{21685}Just give me the damn report.
{21688}{21737}I think you'll find it|very convincing.
{21737}{21761}I'm sure I will.
{21770}{21845}You're the one who found all of our|medical testimonials in the first place.
{21849}{21914}- That's true, Mr. Drape but I...|- Has anyone else seen this?
{21914}{21948}Of course not.|It's your account.
{21948}{21972}Good.
{22031}{22077}I don't want to hear|about it anymore.
{22077}{22139}I'm sorry. I just find|your whole approach perverse.
{22193}{22224}Good luck at the meeting.
{22242}{22282}I'm sure it will be a quick one.
{22428}{22466}Sal, I'll take that drink now.
{23417}{23441}Mr. Draper.
{23492}{23516}Excuse me.
{23547}{23571}Mr. Draper.
{23585}{23649}I'm sorry to wake you,|but Mr. Campbell is outside.
{23701}{23747}He doesn't know|I'm sleeping in here, does he?
{23749}{23796}- No, sir.|- That's good.
{23834}{23860}Who are you?
{23860}{23907}I'm Peggy Olson.|The new girl.
{24024}{24073}Can you go out there|and entertain him?
{24157}{24186}I know it's my first day
{24188}{24273}and I don't want to seem uncooperative,|but do I have to?
{24317}{24341}I see your point.
{24368}{24403}I brought you some aspirin.
{24521}{24545}Send him in.
{24599}{24637}You look like|a hundred bucks.
{24638}{24689}Ready to go sweet-talk|some retail Jews?
{24690}{24746}You are tough to take|first thing in the morning, Pete.
{24746}{24784}I've never|had any complaints.
{24790}{24851}Speaking of which,|who's your little friend here?
{24852}{24876}She's the new girl.
{24884}{24919}You always|get the new girl.
{24927}{24965}Management|gets all the perks.
{24990}{25023}Where are you from,|honey?
{25031}{25072}Miss Deaver's|Secretarial School.
{25078}{25102}Top notch.
{25116}{25195}But I meant where are you from?|Are you Amish or something?
{25222}{25270}No. I'm from Brooklyn.
{25297}{25334}Well, you're in the city now.
{25335}{25381}It wouldn't be a sin|for us to see your legs.
{25381}{25446}If you pull your waist in,|you might look like a woman.
{25446}{25476}Is that all, Mr. Draper?
{25479}{25516}Hey, I'm not done here.
{25528}{25559}I'm working my way up.
{25574}{25600}That will be all.
{25603}{25627}Peggy, right?
{25637}{25661}Yes.
{25661}{25713}Oh, and it's time|for your 11:00 meeting.
{25721}{25769}Oh, and sorry about|Mr. Campbell here.
{25769}{25831}He left his manners back|at the fraternity house.
{25920}{25966}She's a little young|for you, Draper.
{25974}{26026}The future Mrs. Pete Campbell|is a very lucky woman.
{26026}{26066}- When's the wedding again?|- Sunday.
{26067}{26116}Did Ken tell you about the bachelor|party tonight?
{26116}{26140}He sure did.
{26144}{26183}So do I get|first crack at her?
{26186}{26251}Word is she took down more|sailors thanThe Arizona.
{26260}{26288}How old are you, Pete?
{26296}{26320}I just turned 26.
{26330}{26394}I bet the whole world looks like|one great big brassiere strap
{26399}{26433}just waiting|to be snapped.
{26448}{26489}You are good|with words, Draper.
{26496}{26552}Campbell, we're both men here,|so I'm gonna be direct.
{26552}{26605}Christ, are you already|sleeping with her?
{26618}{26660}Advertising is|a very small world,
{26672}{26723}and when you do something|like malign the reputation
{26723}{26782}of a girl from the steno pool|on her first day,
{26793}{26824}you make it even smaller.
{26835}{26888}Keep it up, and even|if you do get my job,
{26895}{26930}you'll never run this place.
{26943}{26983}You'll die|in that corner office,
{26983}{27036}a mid-level executive|with a little bit of hair
{27036}{27080}who women go home with|out of pity.
{27115}{27139}Want to know why?
{27169}{27206}Because|no one will like you.
{27379}{27426}Oh! Here are our|miracle-workers now.
{27440}{27473}You know Pete Campbell, of course,
{27473}{27533}your account executive|if you choose to do business with us.
{27533}{27571}And this handsome fellow is Don Draper,
{27571}{27615}the best creative director in New York.
{27615}{27650}Well, at least the building.
{27651}{27680}A pleasure to meet you.
{27696}{27740}- Sorry about that.|- I'm Rachel Menken.
{27764}{27826}Oh. Uh, sorry.|I was expecting...
{27830}{27873}You were expecting me to be a man.
{27880}{27904}My father was, too.
{27956}{27980}And you are?
{28026}{28069}Why, Don,|you remember David Cohen
{28081}{28112}from the art department.
{28117}{28152}Of course! David.
{28156}{28217}One of the rising stars|here at Sterling Cooper.
{28231}{28272}Why don't we make|ourselves comfortable?
{28272}{28323}Miss Menken,|you can tell us what you have in mind.
{28323}{28347}Wonderful.
{28405}{28429}That's very subtle.
{28437}{28464}Isn't that your shirt?
{28468}{28525}Had to go all the way to the mailroom,|but I found one.
{29059}{29093}So you must be Peggy Olson.
{29201}{29234}Joan Holloway sent you over.
{29236}{29271}She's a great girl.|How is Joan?
{29276}{29304}She sends her regards.
{29314}{29338}She's a lot of fun.
{29351}{29394}Must be a scream|to work with her.
{29408}{29441}Yes, it's pretty|terrific.
{29525}{29566}Try to make yourself|comfortable.
{29567}{29591}Relax.
{29781}{29830}I see from your chart,|and your finger,
{29869}{29899}that you're not married.
{29910}{29934}That's right.
{29946}{30012}And yet you're interested|in the contraceptive pills.
{30040}{30064}Well, I was...
{30080}{30110}No reason to be nervous.
{30110}{30169}Joan sent you to me|because I'm not here to judge you.
{30169}{30219}There's nothing wrong|with a woman being practical
{30221}{30267}about the possibility|of sexual activity.
{30284}{30308}Spread your knees.
{30337}{30362}That's good to hear.
{30377}{30427}Although, as a doctor,|I'd like to think
{30427}{30475}that putting a woman|in this situation
{30476}{30538}is not gonna turn her|into some kind of strumpet.
{30573}{30621}Slide your fanny toward me.|I'm not gonna bite.
{30836}{30891}I'll warn you now,|I will take you off this
{30911}{30943}medicine if you abuse it.
{30977}{31017}It's for your own good,|really.
{31058}{31106}The fact is,|even in our modern times,
{31135}{31174}easy women|don't find husbands.
{31288}{31320}I understand,|Dr. Emerson.
{31327}{31375}I really am a very|responsible person.
{31414}{31462}I'm sure you're not|that kind of girl.
{31474}{31497}Now, Joan...
{31523}{31572}I'm just kidding along here.|You can get dressed.
{31650}{31708}I'm gonna write you|a prescription for Enovid.
{31736}{31781}They're $11 a month,|but don't think
{31787}{31841}you have to go out|and become the town pump
{31842}{31881}just to get|your money's worth.
{31910}{31933}Excuse my French.
{32034}{32080}So what Don is saying|is that through
{32080}{32127}a variety of media,|including a spot during
{32127}{32178}The Danny Thomas Show,|if you can afford it,
{32178}{32215}we could really boost|awareness.
{32215}{32278}Then, a 10% off coupon|in select ladies' magazines
{32295}{32344}will increase your|first-time visitors.
{32346}{32386}Once we get them|into the store,
{32389}{32413}the rest...
{32443}{32469}is kind of up to you.
{32485}{32533}Mr. Draper, our store|is 60 years old.
{32533}{32572}We share a wall|with Tiffany's.
{32594}{32618}Honestly, a coupon?
{32672}{32705}Miss Menken, coupons work.
{32724}{32774}I think your father would|agree with the strategy.
{32774}{32884}He might, but he's not here because|we just had our lowest sales year ever.
{32910}{32942}So I suppose|what I think
{32950}{32979}matters most right now.
{33030}{33075}Miss Menken,|why did you come here?
{33083}{33117}There are a dozen|other agencies
{33117}{33156}better suited|to your... needs.
{33212}{33270}If I wanted some man|who happened to be from the same...
{33287}{33340}village as my father|to manage my account,
{33348}{33388}I could have stayed|where I was.
{33396}{33440}Their research favors|coupons, too.
{33480}{33525}It's not just research,|Miss Menken.
{33526}{33557}Housewives love coupons.
{33573}{33615}I'm not interested|in housewives.
{33619}{33660}What kind of people|do you want?
{33666}{33719}I want your kind of|people, Mr. Draper:
{33723}{33793}people who don't care about coupons,|whether or not they can afford it.
{33793}{33853}People who are coming to the store|because it is expensive.
{33862}{33926}We obviously have|very different ideas.
{33932}{33999}Yes, like the customer|is always right.
{34036}{34095}Gentlemen, I really thought|you could do better than this.
{34105}{34170}Sterling Cooper has a reputation|for being innovative.
{34175}{34213}Miss, you are way out of line.
{34213}{34275}Don, please. Let's|not get emotional here.
{34277}{34319}There's no reason|we can't talk this out.
{34319}{34388}Talk out what? This silly idea|that people are gonna come
{34388}{34459}to some store they've never been to|because it's more expensive?
{34461}{34491}It works for Chanel.
{34497}{34532}Menken's is not Chanel.
{34539}{34575}That's a vote of confidence.
{34575}{34623}What Don's saying is,|Chanel is a very
{34632}{34663}different kind of place.
{34667}{34715}It's French,|it's continental, it's...
{34746}{34796}Not just another|Jewish department store?
{34796}{34820}Exactly.
{34844}{34904}You were right, Roger.|This place really runs on charm.
{34925}{34961}This is ridiculous.
{34975}{35024}I'm not gonna let a woman|talk to me like this.
{35029}{35081}This meeting is over.|Good luck, Miss Menken.
{35372}{35411}Hey, Don,|I don't blame you.
{35415}{35446}She was way out of line.
{35452}{35477}Adding money and education
{35477}{35520}doesn't take the rude|edge out of people.
{35520}{35582}Roger's not gonna be happy,|so I guess that's good for you.
{35614}{35660}I'm not gonna pretend|I don't want your job,
{35660}{35726}but you were right.|I'm not great with people,
{35750}{35827}and you are. I mean, not counting|that meeting we were just in.
{35831}{35893}So I'm kind of counting|on you to help me out.
{35916}{35959}There's plenty of room at the top.
{36063}{36118}Look, I'm sorry|I was so hard on you before.
{36123}{36166}It's just this damn|tobacco thing.
{36186}{36219}You'll think of something.
{36219}{36279}A man like you|I'd follow into combat blindfolded,
{36290}{36325}and I wouldn't be the first.
{36329}{36353}Am I right, buddy?
{36407}{36445}Let's take it a little slower.
{36450}{36492}I don't want to wake up pregnant.
{36726}{36766}Dr. Emerson's a dream, isn't he?
{36776}{36804}He seemed nice.
{36819}{36856}He has a place|in South Hampton.
{36856}{36898}I'm not saying|that I've seen it,
{36898}{36922}but it's beautiful.
{36958}{37001}Now, don't be nervous,|but this is
{37011}{37050}the nerve center|of the office.
{37068}{37119}You and your boss rely|on the willing and
{37121}{37158}cheerful cooperation|of a few
{37161}{37185}skilled employees.
{37199}{37255}Never snap, yell, or be|sarcastic with them.
{37312}{37360}And above all,|always be a supplicant.
{37531}{37586}I know you girls are busy,|but we've got a new one.
{37586}{37635}Peggy, this is Marge,|Nanette, and Ivy.
{37697}{37730}I brought you some things.
{37730}{37787}I guess a sort of|"getting to know you" gift.
{37820}{37858}Well, aren't you|a sweetheart.
{37863}{37907}If I know Joan,|the candy's for me.
{37913}{37941}Joan, you're not fair.
{37944}{37982}You know|she has to lose 8 pounds
{37982}{38011}by the Christmas party.
{38019}{38048}I think you look great.
{38052}{38092}That's because|I'm sitting down.
{38105}{38166}You can come back and visit|any time you want, honey.
{38166}{38194}Who does she work for?
{38194}{38218}Don Draper.
{38229}{38259}They got rid|of Eleanor?
{38262}{38286}She moved on.
{38292}{38319}Draper wasn't interested.
{38333}{38382}Well, she couldn't|get a call through.
{38385}{38413}Rude little thing.
{38424}{38461}I see that you've got|your hands full.
{38461}{38494}Don't want to be|a bother.
{38496}{38520}Nice meeting you.
{38522}{38553}Hey,|you have great legs.
{38553}{38613}I bet you Mr. Draper would like them|if he could see them.
{38634}{38686}Sterling Cooper.|How may I direct your call?
{38767}{38804}I just don't know|what we have to do
{38804}{38859}to make these government|interlopers happy.
{38866}{38915}They tell us to make|a safer cigarette,
{38923}{38957}we do it,|and then suddenly
{38978}{39007}that's not good enough.
{39019}{39062}Might as well be|living in Russia.
{39068}{39092}Mm. Damn straight.
{39230}{39274}You know, this morning|I got a call
{39285}{39338}from my competitors|at Brown & Williamson,
{39344}{39403}and they're getting sued|by the federal government
{39404}{39449}because of the health claims they made.
{39450}{39488}Yeah, we're aware of that, Mr. Garner,
{39489}{39565}but you have to realize that through|the manipulation of the mass media,
{39567}{39642}the public is under the impression|that your cigarettes are linked to...
{39685}{39714}certain fatal diseases.
{39753}{39784}Manipulation of the media?
{39784}{39825}Hell,|that's what I pay you for.
{39838}{39864}Our product is fine.
{39877}{39901}I smoke 'em myself.
{39910}{39939}My granddad smoked 'em.
{39940}{39971}He died at 95 years old.
{39985}{40013}He was hit by a truck.
{40020}{40068}I understand.|But our hands are tied.
{40071}{40140}We're no longer allowed to advertise|that Lucky Strikes are safe.
{40146}{40175}What the hell|are we gonna do?
{40176}{40221}We've already funded|our own tobacco
{40222}{40263}research center|to put this whole
{40268}{40292}rumor to rest.
{40298}{40335}And that's|a very good start.
{40346}{40382}But it may not|affect sales.
{40430}{40474}Don, I think maybe|that's your cue.
{40546}{40570}Well, uh...
{40595}{40619}I have been, uh...
{40670}{40710}thinking quite a bit|about this,
{40737}{40761}and, uh...
{41043}{41128}I mean, you know I'm a|Lucky Strike man from way back, so...
{41348}{41381}I might have a solution.
{41418}{41460}At Sterling Cooper,|we've been pioneering
{41460}{41501}the burgeoning field|of research,
{41511}{41566}and our analysis shows|that the health risks
{41568}{41639}associated with your product|is not the end of the world.
{41663}{41725}People get in their cars|every day to go to work,
{41734}{41760}and some of them die.
{41783}{41807}Cars are dangerous.
{41845}{41890}There's nothing|you can do about it.
{41912}{41964}You still have to get|where you're going.
{41992}{42042}Cigarettes are exactly the same,
{42049}{42088}so why don't we simply say,
{42098}{42140}"So what if cigarettes are dangerous?
{42163}{42187}"You're a man.
{42198}{42229}"The world is dangerous.
{42248}{42276}"Smoke your cigarette.
{42288}{42343}You still have to get|where you're going. "
{42383}{42413}That's very interesting.
{42452}{42516}I mean, if cigarettes|were dangerous,
{42523}{42579}- it would be interesting.|- Except they aren't.
{42597}{42621}That's your slogan?
{42636}{42692}"You're going to die anyway.|Die with us"?
{42704}{42744}Actually, it's a fairly well-established
{42744}{42853}psychological principle|that society has a death wish,
{42872}{42917}and if we could|just tap into that,
{42931}{42958}the market potential is...
{42958}{43000}What the hell are you|talking about?
{43000}{43024}Are you insane?
{43037}{43070}I'm not|selling rifles here.
{43070}{43106}I'm in the tobacco|business.
{43120}{43147}We're selling America.
{43160}{43210}The Indian gave it to us, for shit sake.
{43229}{43253}Come on, Dad.
{43269}{43297}Let's get out of here.
{43352}{43397}The bright spot is,|at least we know
{43411}{43442}if we|have this problem,
{43443}{43477}everybody|has this problem.
{43797}{43865}Gentlemen, before you leave,|can I just say something?
{43865}{43900}I don't know, Don. Can you?
{43996}{44057}The Federal Trade Commission|and Reader's Digest
{44061}{44089}have done you a favor.
{44100}{44178}They've let you know that any ad|that brings up the concept of cigarettes
{44182}{44212}and health together...
{44242}{44305}well, it's just gonna|make people think of cancer.
{44326}{44367}Yes, and we're|grateful to them.
{44416}{44458}But what Lee, Jr.,|said is right.
{44531}{44572}If you can't make|those health claims,
{44572}{44609}neither|can your competitors.
{44644}{44679}So we've got|a lot of people
{44704}{44757}not saying anything|that sells cigarettes.
{44780}{44804}Not exactly.
{44828}{44884}This is the greatest|advertising opportunity
{44887}{44924}since the invention|of cereal.
{44951}{45029}We have six identical companies|making six identical products.
{45078}{45114}We can say anything we want.
{45132}{45173}How do you|make your cigarettes?
{45195}{45219}I don't know.
{45242}{45266}Shame on you.
{45305}{45355}We breed insect-repellent|tobacco seeds,
{45365}{45398}plant them in|the North Carolina
{45398}{45430}sunshine,|grow it, cut it,
{45448}{45474}cure it, toast it...
{45498}{45532}There you go. There you go.
{45757}{45805}But everybody else's|tobacco is toasted.
{45805}{45858}No. Everybody else's|tobacco is poisonous.
{45916}{45940}Lucky Strike...
{45958}{45982}is toasted.
{46038}{46081}Gentlemen,|I don't think I have to tell you
{46083}{46115}what you just witnessed here.
{46157}{46181}I think you do.
{46241}{46296}Advertising|is based on one thing:
{46334}{46358}happiness.
{46384}{46423}And you know what happiness is?
{46427}{46511}Happiness|is the smell of a new car.
{46536}{46581}It's freedom from fear.
{46586}{46655}It's a billboard|on the side of the road
{46659}{46734}that screams with reassurance|that whatever you're doing...
{46770}{46794}it's okay.
{46883}{46907}You are okay.
{47118}{47142}It's toasted.
{47232}{47256}I get it.
{47524}{47548}You had me worried.
{47576}{47606}I don't know if you were drunk
{47606}{47688}or not drunk,|but that was inspired.
{47703}{47761}For the record,|I pulled it out of thin air,
{47762}{47799}so thank you, up there.
{47807}{47855}You're looking|in the wrong direction.
{47860}{47919}So now that I've got you|in the afterglow here,
{47926}{47988}what do you say you reconsider|this presidential campaign?
{48005}{48051}I don't know.|Bunting and babies?
{48068}{48092}That's hard work.
{48102}{48133}I would make hash of it.
{48147}{48186}Modesty.|That's adorable.
{48201}{48245}Consider the product:|he's young, handsome,
{48245}{48269}Navy hero.
{48269}{48308}Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult
{48308}{48357}to convince America|Dick Nixon is a winner.
{48365}{48405}Mr. Draper,|you've got visitors.
{48450}{48504}Could you be a little|more specific, honey?
{48538}{48573}We heard|you saved the day.
{48595}{48621}Aw, thank you, boys.
{48624}{48648}I appreciate it.
{48667}{48705}I told them|how amazing you were.
{48706}{48729}I'm still tingling.
{48747}{48822}Looks like you're all going to engage|in a little mid-level camaraderie,
{48822}{48882}so I'll be on my way.|Don, thanks again for the home run.
{48882}{48911}I love to come through.
{48912}{48982}Any chance you could patch things up|with Rachel Menken?
{48982}{49034}Any way you can be as charming|as I said you were?
{49043}{49091}Haven't you had enough of my magic|for one day?
{49107}{49137}She's worth $3 million.
{49161}{49185}You're a whore.
{49271}{49298}Peggy...
{49300}{49336}Could she get us a little more ice?
{49338}{49363}Yes, Mr. Draper?
{49367}{49395}Just a minute.
{49401}{49458}Fellas, I think this party's gonna|have to move elsewhere.
{49462}{49513}We'll move wherever you want,|but it's 5:15.
{49514}{49552}The bachelor party's underway.
{49562}{49586}I don't know.
{49588}{49636}Oh, come on, Don.|All hands on deck.
{49636}{49696}Aren't you gonna help|give Pete his big sendoff?
{49696}{49720}Maybe next time.
{49803}{49861}Come on, guys.|Don will join us later, right?
{50068}{50102}If Greta's research|was any good,
{50102}{50129}I would have used it.
{50172}{50206}What are you|talking about?
{50211}{50241}I'm saying|I had a report
{50241}{50265}just like that.
{50272}{50328}And it's not like there's|some magic machine
{50334}{50381}that makes identical|copies of things.
{50425}{50460}I still think|she was right.
{50602}{50633}Have a great night, Pete.
{50663}{50687}Congratulations.
{50922}{50973}I heard you were|amazing in the meeting.
{50993}{51032}Fear stimulates|my imagination.
{51101}{51163}I just wanted to thank you|for a great first day,
{51204}{51229}and for, you know...
{51273}{51320}standing up for me|with Mr. Campbell.
{51696}{51740}First of all, Peggy,|I'm your boss,
{51747}{51771}not your boyfriend.
{51828}{51871}Second of all,|you ever let Pete Campbell
{51871}{51899}go through my trash again,
{51900}{51979}and you won't be able to find a job|selling sandwiches in Penn Station.
{52045}{52096}He said he left|his fountain pen in here.
{52117}{52141}I didn't know.
{52241}{52298}I hope you don't think|I'm that kind of girl.
{52325}{52349}Of course not.
{52390}{52414}Go home.
{52415}{52441}Put your curlers in.
{52447}{52488}We'll get a fresh start|tomorrow.
{52535}{52568}Oh. And, Peggy,|I need you
{52603}{52627}to place a call.
{53126}{53214}I want to see you here every 15 minutes,|whether you have drinks or not.
{53216}{53248}Uh, every five minutes.
{53305}{53329}Let's live here.
{53358}{53399}Better do more|than look tonight.
{53403}{53442}Do you have a girlfriend,|Salvatore?
{53442}{53468}Come on. I'm Italian.
{53526}{53567}Is there some kind|of party here?
{53619}{53645}How did you swing it?
{53650}{53682}They work at the Automat.
{53687}{53737}He pressed a button,|and they came out.
{53753}{53799}I do hope we're not|interrupting anything.
{53801}{53825}Definitely not.
{53828}{53859}Well, I have the best seat.
{53861}{53889}What are we drinking?
{53893}{53945}More of whatever's making you|the way you are.
{53950}{53974}I love this place.
{53987}{54033}It's hot, loud,|and filled with men.
{54070}{54096}I know what you mean.
{54405}{54447}Oh, my God. I can|hardly feel it.
{54473}{54528}I have a feeling you're|like this all the time.
{54528}{54552}I like to laugh.
{54560}{54584}Is that right?
{54614}{54638}Now,|you stop that.
{54650}{54684}You said you like|to laugh.
{54707}{54731}I mean it.
{54738}{54762}It's... It's too...
{54768}{54792}Too delicious.
{54819}{54843}I said stop it.
{54845}{54901}- What do you think you're doing?|- You know exactly.
{54943}{54991}You know what, girls?|I think we should go.
{54993}{55021}Oh, come on.
{55029}{55059}You're hurting me.
{55131}{55155}I'll be good.
{55213}{55255}Buy the girls whatever they want.
{55421}{55465}So, uh, what do you fellas do?
{55474}{55525}You're looking at the finest|ad men in New York.
{55538}{55566}Hell, the world.
{56195}{56235}For the lady, a special Mai Tai,
{56265}{56291}and one whiskey neat.
{56412}{56511}So you're going|to ply me with drinks
{56512}{56571}and convince me|what a terrible mistake I'm making.
{56610}{56637}That is quite a drink.
{56662}{56701}You got in trouble,|didn't you?
{56793}{56834}I shouldn't|have lost my temper,
{56835}{56886}and I certainly|shouldn't have treated you
{56886}{56919}like anything|less than a client.
{56919}{56943}Apology accepted.
{56999}{57023}So you understand.
{57059}{57083}Now I do.
{57105}{57144}It was, uh,|refreshing, really.
{57201}{57240}I mean, actually|hearing all the things
{57240}{57288}I always assumed|people were thinking.
{57357}{57407}Well, I'm not really|as bad as all that.
{57466}{57504}I was under|a lot of pressure.
{57520}{57544}Another account.
{57618}{57645}Doesn't really matter.
{57676}{57700}No, it doesn't.
{57832}{57872}So, without|making things worse,
{57877}{57916}can I ask you|a personal question?
{57916}{57978}Don't you want to get|a second drink in me first?
{57995}{58024}Why aren't you married?
{58078}{58123}Are you asking|what's wrong with me?
{58128}{58179}It's just that you're|a beautiful, educated woman.
{58179}{58216}Don't you think that getting married
{58216}{58257}and having a family|would make you happier
{58259}{58304}than all the headaches|that go along with
{58314}{58344}fighting people like me?
{58430}{58466}If I weren't a woman,|I would be
{58466}{58512}allowed to ask you|the same question,
{58545}{58598}and if I weren't a woman,|I wouldn't have to choose
{58601}{58661}between putting on an apron
{58665}{58726}and the thrill|of making my father's store
{58728}{58772}what I always thought it should be.
{58775}{58836}So that's it.|You won't get married because
{58860}{58905}you find business to be a thrill.
{58921}{58945}That and...
{59050}{59081}I've never been in love.
{59115}{59178}She won't get married|because she's never been in love.
{59194}{59246}I think I wrote that|once to sell nylons.
{59271}{59329}For a lot of people,|love isn't just a slogan.
{59365}{59389}Oh, you mean love.
{59391}{59434}You mean the big|lightning bolt to the heart
{59434}{59482}where you can't eat|and you can't work
{59486}{59532}and you just run off|and get married
{59584}{59608}and make babies.
{59659}{59696}The reason|you haven't felt it
{59707}{59742}is because|it doesn't exist.
{59753}{59812}What you call love|was invented by guys like me
{59837}{59861}to sell nylons.
{59901}{59925}Is that right?
{59952}{59984}I'm pretty sure|about it.
{60032}{60071}You're born alone,|and you die alone,
{60071}{60133}and this world just drops|a bunch of rules on you
{60134}{60167}to make you|forget those facts,
{60167}{60191}but I never forget.
{60252}{60300}I'm living like there's|no tomorrow...
{60330}{60360}because there isn't one.
{60426}{60480}I don't think I realized|until this moment,
{60534}{60580}but it must be hard|being a man, too.
{60672}{60696}Excuse me?
{60745}{60781}- Mr. Draper...|- Don.
{60783}{60862}Mr. Draper, I don't know|what it is you really believe in,
{60890}{60972}but I do know|what it feels like to be out of place,
{60999}{61039}to be disconnected,
{61064}{61124}to see the whole world|laid out in front of you
{61133}{61170}the way other people|live it.
{61204}{61239}There is something|about you
{61250}{61289}that tells me|you know it, too.
{61454}{61489}I don't know if that's true.
{61554}{61583}You want another drink?
{61614}{61638}No.
{61667}{61726}But you can tell your boss|that you charmed me.
{61905}{61960}So I guess we'll be|seeing each other again.
{61962}{62029}I'll be back in the office|Monday morning, for a real meeting.
{62094}{62118}I'd like that.
{62528}{62561}We're not buying anything.
{62564}{62608}Actually,|for the first time today,
{62626}{62657}I'm not selling anything.
{62692}{62718}Does Peggy live here?
{62738}{62762}Hold on.
{63072}{63096}Do you know him?
{63151}{63192}It's okay, Marjorie.|We work together.
{63233}{63257}He's really drunk.
{63263}{63288}It's okay, Marjorie.
{63375}{63399}So...
{63418}{63442}what are you doing?
{63490}{63567}Nothing. Just, uh, sitting in my room|listening to records.
{63579}{63617}I'm getting married|on Sunday.
{63643}{63667}I heard that.
{63745}{63779}You must think I'm a creep.
{63859}{63883}Why are you here?
{64147}{64182}I wanted to see you tonight.
{64302}{64326}Me?
{64365}{64389}I had to see you.
{64644}{64668}Marjorie.
{64677}{64701}Yeah, Peg?
{64736}{64762}I'm going|to bed now.
{66873}{66898}I called the office.
{66914}{66940}They said you'd left.
{67050}{67085}I didn't want|to bother you.
{67090}{67114}It's no bother.
{67134}{67173}I just assumed|you were staying
{67179}{67203}in the city again.
{67269}{67304}There's a plate|in the oven.
{67476}{67507}Unless|you're not hungry.
{67526}{67550}I'm not.
{67657}{67681}I'll be right back.
{67732}{67756}Don't move.
