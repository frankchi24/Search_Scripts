1
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:12,256
Finished, sir!
Yeah, do you have a light?

2
00:01:18,373 --> 00:01:20,255
Old Gold man, huh?

3
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:23,666
Lucky Strike here.

4
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,942
Can I ask you a question?
Why do you smoke Old Gold?

5
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:29,530
I'm sorry, sir.
Is Sam here bothering you?

6
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,647
He can be
a little chatty.

7
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:35,568
No, we're actually just
having a conversation.
Is that okay?

8
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,960
Can I get you
another drink?

9
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,018
Yeah. Do this again.
Old-fashioned, please.

10
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:45,724
So you obviously need to relax
after working here all night.

11
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:47,841
I guess.
I don't know.

12
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:51,644
But what is it? I mean, low-tar?
Those new filters? Why, I mean, why Old Gold?

13
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,491
They gave 'em to us in the service...
a carton a week for free.

14
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:57,059
So you're used to 'em, is that it?

15
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:59,843
Yeah. They're a habit.

16
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:03,764
I could never get you to try another brand...
say, my Luckies?

17
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:06,470
I love my Old Golds.

18
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:13,606
All right, well,let's just say tomorrow
a tobacco weevil comes
and eats every last Old Gold on the planet.

19
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,140
That's a sad story.

20
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,826
It's a tragedy.

21
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,649
Would you just stop smoking?

22
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,472
I think I could find something.

23
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,315
I love smoking.

24
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,903
"I love smoking. "
That's very good.

25
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:28,236
My wife hates it.

26
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,354
Reader's Digest
says it will kill you.

27
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,902
Yeah,
I heard about that.

28
00:02:33,804 --> 00:02:36,549
Ladies love their magazines.

29
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,215
Yes, they do.

30
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,572
You weren't worried about waking me, were you?

31
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,395
Am I interrupting anything?
Mmm, no.

32
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:20,277
You're lucky I'm still up working

33
00:03:20,397 --> 00:03:22,080
and I'm all alone.

34
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,413
How's it going?

35
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:27,021
They invented something called Grandmother's Day.

36
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,510
That ought to keep me busy drawing
puppies for a few months.

37
00:03:32,052 --> 00:03:33,621
Can I run a few ideas past you?

38
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:37,934
Does that mean what I think it means?
Because I'm familiar with most of your ideas.

39
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,992
I'm having a situation with my cigarette account.

40
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:43,305
You really are here to talk.

41
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:47,579
The Trade Commission is cracking
down on all of our health claims.

42
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:49,265
I get Reader's Digest.

43
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:51,931
This is the same scare you had five years ago.

44
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:53,029
You dealt with it.

45
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,634
I know I slept a lot better,
knowing doctors smoke.

46
00:03:56,754 --> 00:04:00,281
Well, that's just it. The whole
"safer cigarette" thing is over.

47
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:02,508
No more doctors, no more testimonials,

48
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:05,744
no more cough-free, soothes your T-zone,

49
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:07,685
low-tar, low-nicotine, filter tip.

50
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:08,505
Nothing.

51
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:14,688
All I have is a crush-proof box
and "four out of five dead people smoke your brand. "

52
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:20,379
Is this the part where I say,
"Don Draper is the greatest ad man ever,

53
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:24,821
"and his big, strong brain will find a way
to lead the sheep to the slaughterhouse"?

54
00:04:26,576 --> 00:04:28,312
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.

55
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,771
You gonna pitch to me or not?
<i>Midge, I'm serious. I have nothing.</i>

56
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:37,451
I am over, and they're finally gonna know it.
Next time you see me,

57
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:40,321
there'll be a bunch of young executives picking meat off my ribs.

58
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:41,880
That's a pretty picture.

59
00:04:44,712 --> 00:04:45,928
What's your secret?

60
00:04:48,006 --> 00:04:50,712
Nine different ways to say...

61
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:54,156
"I love you ... Grandma. "

62
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:13,404
We should get married.

63
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,942
You think I'd make a good ex-wife?

64
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:18,885
I'm serious.

65
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,564
You have your own business.

66
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:23,494
You don't mind when I come over.

67
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,088
What size Cadillac do you take?

68
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:31,402
You know the rules. I don't make plans,

69
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:33,589
and I don't make breakfast.

70
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:40,126
Sterling's having the tobacco people in

71
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:41,438
in nine hours,

72
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:42,561
and I have nothing.

73
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,279
People love smoking.

74
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,042
There's nothing that you,

75
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:51,978
the Trade Commission, or Reader's Digest
can do to change that.

76
00:05:57,834 --> 00:06:00,199
There's this kid who comes
by my office every day,

77
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,673
looks where he's gonna
put his plants.

78
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,818
Is he handsome?

79
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:25,847
23.

80
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,061
Uh, not right away.

81
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:31,041
Pal, could you take the long way up?
I am really enjoying the view here.

82
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:33,014
You going to Campbell's bachelor party?

83
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:36,896
Yeah, I want to be there before they tie an anchor
around his neck and drag him out to sea.

84
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:40,161
I hear she's a nice girl.
<i>Eh, who wants that?</i>

85
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,148
What did you do that for?

86
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:48,032
She'll probably be assigned to one of us.

87
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:53,568
Then she'll know what she's in for.
You got to let them know what kind of guy you are.
Then they'll know what kind of girl to be.

88
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:56,684
I have a feeling we won't be going
to your bachelor party anytime soon.

89
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:59,636
Yeah, well, compared to Campbell,
I'm a Boy Scout.

90
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:03,080
Excuse me.Is he expecting you?
<i>He's not expecting anything.</i>

91
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:07,426
Oh, honey, don't worry. I'll get home safely.

92
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:11,609
I have an important appointment right now,
so why don't you go shopping or something?

93
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,930
Take your mother to lunch.
Tell her it was my idea.

94
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,734
Wow. He's good.

95
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,661
It's just a bachelor party, dear.

96
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:22,011
No, I really don't know what they have planned,

97
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:26,644
but judging from the creative brain power around here,
we'll probably end up seeing My Fair Lady.

98
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:29,638
I'll tell you what.

99
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:33,861
I'll drop by your place on my way home.
Your mother can check under my fingernails.

100
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,567
Of course I love you.

101
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:39,888
I'm giving up my life to be with you, aren't I?

102
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:45,301
What a great gal.

103
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:50,057
I tell ya, boys, ...
she stole my heart.

104
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:52,394
And her old man's loaded.

105
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,105
Now, this is the executive floor.
It should be organized, but it's not,

106
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:02,411
so you'll find account executives
and creative executives all mixed in together.

107
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:04,789
- Please don't ask me the difference.
<i>- Great.</i>

108
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:08,069
Hopefully, if you follow my lead,
you can avoid some of the mistakes I've made here.

109
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:10,201
- Hello, Joan.
<i>- Like that one.</i>

110
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,285
- So how many trains did it take you?
- Only one, but I got up very early.

111
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:18,484
In a couple of years, with the right moves,
you'll be in the city with the rest of us.

112
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:23,404
Of course, if you really make the right moves,
you'll be out in the country, and you won't be going to work at all.

113
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:28,606
You'll be here just across the aisle from me.
We'll both take care of Mr. Draper for the time being.

114
00:08:28,726 --> 00:08:32,132
I don't know what your goals are,
but don't overdo it with the perfume.

115
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:35,576
Keep a fifth of something in your desk.
Mr. Draper drinks dry.

116
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:39,881
Also, invest in some aspirin,
Band-Aids, and a needle and thread.

117
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:43,120
- Rye is Canadian, right?
<i>- You better find out.</i>

118
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,196
He may act like he wants a secretary,

119
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:49,517
but most of the time, they're looking
for something between a mother and a waitress.

120
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,731
And the rest of the time, well...

121
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,925
Go home, take a paper bag,
and cut some eyeholes out of it.

122
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:03,369
Put it over your head, get undressed,
and look at yourself in the mirror.

123
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:07,797
Really evaluate where your strengths
and weaknesses are, and be honest.

124
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,765
I always try to be honest.

125
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:11,487
Good for you.

126
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:16,572
Now, try not to be overwhelmed by all
this technology. It looks complicated,

127
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:19,115
but the men who designed it made it
simple enough for a woman to use.

128
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:20,263
I sure hope so.

129
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:25,265
At lunch, pick up a box of chocolates,
a dozen carnations, and some bath salts.
- I'll explain later.

130
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:29,242
- Thank you, Miss Holloway.You're really wonderful
for looking out for me this way.

131
00:09:29,362 --> 00:09:30,472
It's Joan.

132
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:32,317
And listen,

133
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:34,367
don't take this the wrong way,

134
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:36,828
but a girl like you,
with those darling little ankles,

135
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:39,329
I'd find a way to make 'em sing.

136
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:42,240
Also, men love scarves.

137
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,290
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

138
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,647
Oh! And Mr. Sterling.
How are you?
<i>Morning, girls.</i>

139
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:53,978
You look like a hundred bucks. Long night?

140
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,734
It's not this tobacco thing, is it?

141
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:57,226
It's been on my mind.

142
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,497
Yeah, well, I should hope so.

143
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:02,174
Lee Garner, his father, the whole Lucky Strike
family will be here at 4.

144
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,225
You worried?

145
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:06,124
No.

146
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,229
If I was worried, I'd ask you what you've got,

147
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:09,090
but I'm not,

148
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,688
so I'm just going to assume you've got something,

149
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:12,478
which means you should be worried.

150
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,045
So you came here because you
wanted to watch me get dressed?

151
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,191
No, I wanted to make
sure you were here.

152
00:10:18,454 --> 00:10:21,556
In body. Give me about a
half hour for the rest of it.

153
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:22,814
Oh.

154
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,247
How do I put this?

155
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,200
Have we
ever hired any Jews?

156
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:29,006
Not on my watch.

157
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,001
That's very funny.
It's not what I meant.

158
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,325
We've got an Italian.

159
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,156
Salvatore, my art director.

160
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:36,185
That won't work.

161
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:37,333
Sorry.

162
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:39,315
Most of the Jewish guys
work for the Jewish firms.

163
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:40,244
Yeah, I know.

164
00:10:40,364 --> 00:10:42,131
Selling Jewish products
to Jewish people.

165
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,087
That's very good.

166
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:47,202
It's just that our 11:00 is with Menken's Department Store
and I wish we had someone to make them feel...

167
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,186
comfortable.

168
00:10:48,637 --> 00:10:50,838
Want me to run to the deli
and grab somebody?

169
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,175
You missed a button.

170
00:11:39,756 --> 00:11:41,232
Ah. Look at you, Gidget.

171
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,624
Still trying
to fill out that bikini?

172
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,553
Summer's coming.

173
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,168
Without the medical claims,

174
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:51,378
all we have is a white box
with a red spot on it.

175
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:53,537
My neighbor posed for that.

176
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:56,680
Believe me, he always
looks very relaxed.

177
00:11:56,926 --> 00:11:58,266
Of course,
he doesn't smoke.

178
00:11:58,386 --> 00:11:59,591
Had him hold a pencil.

179
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:02,585
If I know these guys, you're better off
with a little sex appeal.

180
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:05,702
Can you give me a woman in a bathing suit,
put her next to your guy?

181
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:06,768
A sexy girl?

182
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:07,807
I can do that.

183
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,952
Give you a chance to get a real model.

184
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:11,306
Oh, I love my work.

185
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,110
Speaking of sexy girls,

186
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,860
are you going to Pete's
bachelor party?

187
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,527
I'm not really big on those things.

188
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:17,648
Tell me about it.

189
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:19,001
It's so embarrassing.

190
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:22,697
If a girl's gonna shake it in my face,
I want to be alone so I can do something.

191
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:26,415
Should we drink before the meeting or after?

192
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,192
Or both?

193
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:31,965
So... that's it, huh?

194
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,152
Relax?
<i>Don't be short with me.</i>

195
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:36,954
You're the writer.I thought
it was worth a try.

196
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:39,949
Greta Guttman
is here to see you.

197
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:41,001
- Send her in.

198
00:12:41,121 --> 00:12:41,862
- Oh, great.

199
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:44,063
Now we get to hear from
our man in research.

200
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,175
Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,

201
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:51,622
you both seemed more relaxed
than I expected.

202
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,973
Do you have some kind of surprise
for the tobacco people?

203
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:55,681
I'm doing my own research.

204
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:58,243
If you're planning to continue with
medical testimony,

205
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,744
you'll only be inviting
further government interference.

206
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,480
We must police ourselves.

207
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,530
- There's your slogan.
<i>- The medical thing is dead.</i>

208
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,702
- We understand that.
<i>- Yes, dead. An apt choice of words,</i>

209
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:10,845
considering the public is convinced
that cigarettes are poisonous.

210
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:14,514
<i>If we can't insist that they're not, I believe
my most recent surveys have provided a solution.</i>

211
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:17,794
We can still suggest that cigarettes
are part of American life,

212
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:19,148
or too good to give up,

213
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:21,744
or, most appealing, an assertion of independence.

214
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:23,918
So, basically, if you love danger,
you'll love smoking.

215
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:26,007
We can put a skull and crossbones on the label.

216
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:27,442
I love it.

217
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:29,623
Before the war, when I studied

218
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:33,217
that what Freud called the death wish

219
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:37,058
is as powerful a drive as those
for sexual reproduction and physical sustenance.

220
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:38,425
Freud, you say?

221
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:40,065
What agency is he with?

222
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:43,400
We're supposed to believe
that people are all living one way

223
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,744
and secretly thinking the exact opposite?

224
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,247
That's ridiculous.

225
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,186
Let me tell you something, Miss Guttman...
<i>Doctor.</i>

226
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:51,877
Dr. Guttman.

227
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,870
Psychology might be great
at cocktail parties,

228
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:59,627
but it so happens that people were buying
cigarettes before Freud was born.

229
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:04,138
The issue here isn't why should people smoke.
It's why should people smoke Lucky Strike.

230
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,405
Suggesting that our customers have a...

231
00:14:07,525 --> 00:14:09,674
What did you call it?
A death wish?

232
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:12,011
I just don't see that on a billboard.

233
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,641
So what if Reader's Digest
says they're dangerous?

234
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:16,951
They also said Bambi was
the book of the century.

235
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:18,236
There's no proof.

236
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:22,888
There's conclusive proof that none of these
low-tar, low-nicotine, or filtration systems

237
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:25,526
have any effect on the incidences
of lung cancer.

238
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:27,234
Just give me the damn report.

239
00:14:27,354 --> 00:14:29,249
I think you'll find it
very convincing.

240
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,575
I'm sure I will.

241
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:33,527
You're the one who found all of our
medical testimonials in the first place.

242
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,371
- That's true, Mr. Drape but I...
<i>- Has anyone else seen this?</i>

243
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,697
Of course not. It's your account.

244
00:14:37,817 --> 00:14:38,640
<i>Good.</i>

245
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:42,344
<i>I don't want to hear about it anymore.</i>

246
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,256
I'm sorry. I just find
your whole approach perverse.

247
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:48,727
Good luck at the meeting.

248
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,256
I'm sure it will be a quick one.

249
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:58,502
Sal, I'll take that drink now.

250
00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:36,850
Mr. Draper.

251
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:40,431
Excuse me.

252
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:42,754
Mr. Draper.

253
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,144
I'm sorry to wake you,
but Mr. Campbell is outside.

254
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,478
He doesn't know I'm sleeping in here, does he?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

255
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:51,735
- That's good.

256
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:54,318
Who are you?

257
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:55,917
I'm Peggy Olson.
The new girl.

258
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,118
Can you go out there
and entertain him?

259
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:11,177
I know it's my first day and I don't want
to seem uncooperative, but do I have to?

260
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:13,547
I see your point.

261
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:16,212
I brought you some aspirin.

262
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:21,210
Send him in.

263
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:25,148
You look like a hundred bucks.

264
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:27,472
Ready to go sweet-talk
some retail Jews?

265
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:29,591
You are tough to take
first thing in the morning, Pete.

266
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,135
I've never
had any complaints.

267
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,445
Speaking of which,
who's your little friend here?

268
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:35,140
She's the new girl.

269
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,766
You always
get the new girl.

270
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:38,626
Management
gets all the perks.

271
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:40,430
Where are you from,
honey?

272
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:42,425
Miss Deaver's
Secretarial School.

273
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:43,942
Top notch.

274
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:45,500
But I meant where are you from?

275
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,852
Are you Amish or something?

276
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:50,933
No. I'm from Brooklyn.

277
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:52,915
Well, you're in the city now.

278
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:54,897
It wouldn't be a sin
for us to see your legs.

279
00:16:55,017 --> 00:16:57,157
If you pull your waist in,
you might look like a woman.

280
00:16:57,526 --> 00:16:58,756
Is that all, Mr. Draper?

281
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:00,643
Hey, I'm not done here.

282
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:02,365
I'm working my way up.

283
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:03,491
That will be all.

284
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:04,981
Peggy, right?

285
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:05,828
Yes.

286
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:07,988
Oh, and it's time
for your 11:00 meeting.

287
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:10,781
Oh, and sorry about
Mr. Campbell here.

288
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:12,968
He left his manners back
at the fraternity house.

289
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:18,440
She's a little young
for you, Draper.

290
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:20,873
The future Mrs. Pete Campbell
is a very lucky woman.

291
00:17:20,993 --> 00:17:22,335
- When's the wedding again?
<i>- Sunday.</i>

292
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:24,360
Did Ken tell you about the
bachelor party tonight?

293
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,672
He sure did.

294
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,216
So do I get
first crack at her?

295
00:17:27,336 --> 00:17:29,868
Word is she took down more
sailors than The Arizona.

296
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:31,385
How old are you, Pete?

297
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:32,944
I just turned 26.

298
00:17:33,064 --> 00:17:36,839
I bet the whole world looks like one great
big brassiere strap just waiting to be snapped.

299
00:17:37,864 --> 00:17:39,409
You are good
with words, Draper.

300
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:41,938
Campbell, we're both men here,
so I'm gonna be direct.

301
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:43,934
Christ, are you already
sleeping with her?

302
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,572
Advertising is
a very small world,

303
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:48,909
and when you do something
like malign the reputation

304
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:51,252
of a girl from the steno pool
on her first day,

305
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,851
you make it even smaller.

306
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:57,060
Keep it up, and even if you do get my job,
you'll never run this place.

307
00:17:57,531 --> 00:18:03,039
You'll die in that corner office,
a mid-level executive with a little bit of hair
who women go home with out of pity.

308
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:05,418
Want to know why?

309
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,028
Because
no one will like you.

310
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:17,461
Oh! Here are our
miracle-workers now.

311
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,893
You know Pete Campbell, of course,
your account executive

312
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:21,096
if you choose to do business with us.

313
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:24,149
And this handsome fellow is Don Draper,
the best creative director in New York.

314
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,691
Well, at least the building.
A pleasure to meet you.

315
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:28,372
- Sorry about that.

316
00:18:28,492 --> 00:18:29,647
- I'm Rachel Menken.

317
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:34,923
Oh. Uh, sorry. I was expecting...
<i>You were expecting me to be a man.</i>

318
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:36,358
My father was, too.

319
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,555
And you are?

320
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,903
Why, Don,
you remember David Cohen

321
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,133
from the art department.

322
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:46,088
Of course! David.

323
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,472
One of the rising stars
here at Sterling Cooper.

324
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:52,737
Why don't we make ourselves comfortable?
Miss Menken, you can tell us what you have in mind.

325
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:53,707
Wonderful.

326
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:56,865
That's very subtle.

327
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,464
Isn't that your shirt?

328
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:01,417
Had to go all the way to the mailroom,
but I found one.

329
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,664
So you must be Peggy Olson.

330
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,770
Joan Holloway sent you over.
She's a great girl. How is Joan?

331
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,068
She sends her regards.

332
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:30,558
She's a lot of fun.

333
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:32,744
Must be a scream
to work with her.

334
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:34,767
Yes, it's pretty
terrific.

335
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:39,896
Try to make yourself
comfortable. Relax.

336
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:49,877
I see from your chart,

337
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,107
and your finger,

338
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:52,146
that you're not married.

339
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:53,335
That's right.

340
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:56,469
And yet you're interested
in the contraceptive pills.

341
00:19:57,972 --> 00:20:00,337


342
00:19:57,972 --> 00:20:00,337
Well, I was...
<i>No reason to be nervous.</i>

343
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:02,940
Joan sent you to me
because I'm not here to judge you.

344
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,826
There's nothing wrong
with a woman being practical

345
00:20:04,946 --> 00:20:07,327
about the possibility
of sexual activity.

346
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:08,639
Spread your knees.

347
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,635
That's good to hear.

348
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:13,163
Although, as a doctor,
I'd like to think

349
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:15,040
that putting a woman
in this situation

350
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,157
is not gonna turn her
into some kind of strumpet.

351
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,550
Slide your fanny toward me.
I'm not gonna bite.

352
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,491
I'll warn you now,

353
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:33,567
I will take you off this
medicine if you abuse it.

354
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:36,579
It's for your own good,
really.

355
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:40,447
The fact is,
even in our modern times,

356
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:44,139
easy women
don't find husbands.

357
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:48,144
I understand,
Dr. Emerson.

358
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:50,126
I really am a very
responsible person.

359
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,475
I'm sure you're not
that kind of girl.

360
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,607
Now, Joan...

361
00:20:55,976 --> 00:20:58,081
I'm just kidding along here.
You can get dressed.

362
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm gonna write you
a prescription for Enovid.

363
00:21:04,274 --> 00:21:06,679
They're $11 a month,
but don't think

364
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,700
you have to go out and become the town 
pump just to get your money's worth.

365
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:12,448
Excuse my French.

366
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,885
So what Don is saying is that through
a variety of media,

367
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:21,460
including a spot during The Danny Thomas Show,
if you can afford it,

368
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,018
we could really boost
awareness.

369
00:21:23,138 --> 00:21:26,273
Then, a 10% off coupon
in select ladies' magazines

370
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:27,982
will increase your
first-time visitors.

371
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:30,784
Once we get them
into the store, the rest...

372
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,230
is kind of up to you.

373
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,608
Mr. Draper, our store
is 60 years old.

374
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:37,622
We share a wall
with Tiffany's.

375
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,822
Honestly, a coupon?

376
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,671
Miss Menken, coupons work.

377
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:44,940
I think your father would
agree with the strategy.

378
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,204
He might, but he's not here because
we just had our lowest sales year ever.

379
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:53,441
So I suppose what I think
matters most right now.

380
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:57,186
Miss Menken,
why did you come here?

381
00:21:57,306 --> 00:22:01,286
There are a dozen other agencies
better suited to your... needs.

382
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:04,661
If I wanted some man
who happened to be from the same...

383
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:08,884
village as my father to manage my account,
I could have stayed where I was.

384
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,440
Their research favors
coupons, too.

385
00:22:12,426 --> 00:22:14,148
It's not just research,
Miss Menken.

386
00:22:14,268 --> 00:22:16,143
Housewives love coupons.

387
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:17,824
I'm not interested
in housewives.

388
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:19,492
What kind of people
do you want?

389
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:22,121
I want your kind of
people, Mr. Draper:

390
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,800
people who don't care about coupons, 
whether or not they can afford it.

391
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,137
People who are coming to the store 
because it is expensive.

392
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,245
We obviously have
very different ideas.

393
00:22:30,365 --> 00:22:33,074
Yes, like the customer
is always right.

394
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,643
Gentlemen, I really thought
you could do better than this.

395
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:39,732
Sterling Cooper has a reputation
for being innovative.

396
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:41,851
Miss, you are way out of line.
<i>- Don, please.</i>

397
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:45,345
Let's not get emotional here.
There's no reason we can't talk this out.

398
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,344
Talk out what? This silly idea
that people are gonna come

399
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:51,009
to some store they've never been to
because it's more expensive?

400
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:52,321
It works for Chanel.

401
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:53,898
Menken's is not Chanel.

402
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:55,538
That's a vote of confidence.

403
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:56,837
What Don's saying is,

404
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:59,084
Chanel is a very
different kind of place.

405
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:02,077
It's French,
it's continental, it's...

406
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:03,922
Not just another
Jewish department store?

407
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:04,934
Exactly.

408
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:08,752
You were right, Roger.
This place really runs on charm.

409
00:23:09,148 --> 00:23:10,734
This is ridiculous.
<i>-Don.</i>

410
00:23:11,021 --> 00:23:12,920
I'm not gonna let a woman
talk to me like this.

411
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,244
This meeting is over.
Good luck, Miss Menken.

412
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:28,316
Hey, Don,
I don't blame you.

413
00:23:28,436 --> 00:23:29,724
She was way out of line.

414
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:32,430
Adding money and education
doesn't take the rude edge out of people.

415
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,404
Roger's not gonna be happy,
so I guess that's good for you.

416
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,165
I'm not gonna pretend
I don't want your job,

417
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:41,089
but you were right.
I'm not great with people,

418
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:42,812
and you are. I mean,

419
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:44,908
not counting
that meeting we were just in.

420
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,396
So I'm kind of counting
on you to help me out.

421
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:49,514
There's plenty of room at the top.

422
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:56,103
Look, I'm sorry
I was so hard on you before.

423
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:58,085
It's just this damn
tobacco thing.

424
00:23:58,564 --> 00:23:59,576
You'll think of something.

425
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:02,077
A man like you
I'd follow into combat blindfolded,

426
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:05,152
and I wouldn't be the first.
Am I right, buddy?

427
00:24:06,984 --> 00:24:10,570
Let's take it a little slower.
I don't want to wake up pregnant.

428
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:21,447
Dr. Emerson's a dream, isn't he?

429
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,445
He seemed nice.

430
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,367
He has a place in South Hampton.
I'm not saying that I've seen it,

431
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:27,775
but it's beautiful.

432
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:32,655
Now, don't be nervous, but this is
the nerve center of the office.

433
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:37,937
You and your boss rely on the willing and
cheerful cooperation of a few skilled employees.

434
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:42,338
Never snap, yell, or be
sarcastic with them.

435
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:45,701
And above all,
always be a supplicant.

436
00:24:51,236 --> 00:24:52,244
I know you girls are busy,

437
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:53,365
but we've got a new one.

438
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:56,467
Peggy, this is Marge,
Nanette, and Ivy.

439
00:24:57,688 --> 00:25:01,174
I brought you some things. I guess a 
sort of "getting to know you" gift.

440
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:04,036
Well, aren't you
a sweetheart.

441
00:25:04,156 --> 00:25:06,031
If I know Joan,
the candy's for me.

442
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:10,041
Joan, you're not fair. You know
she has to lose 8 pounds by the Christmas party.

443
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:11,394
I think you look great.

444
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:13,007
That's because
I'm sitting down.

445
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:15,645
You can come back and visit
any time you want, honey.

446
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,083
Who does she work for?
<i>Don Draper.</i>

447
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,532
They got rid
of Eleanor?

448
00:25:19,778 --> 00:25:20,708
She moved on.

449
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,279
Draper wasn't interested.

450
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:24,426
Well, she couldn't
get a call through.

451
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:25,916
Rude little thing.

452
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:27,433
I see that you've got
your hands full.

453
00:25:27,553 --> 00:25:28,731
Don't want to be
a bother.

454
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:29,880
Nice meeting you.

455
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,151
Hey,
you have great legs.

456
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:33,353
I bet you Mr. Draper would like them
if he could see them.

457
00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:37,303
Sterling Cooper.
How may I direct your call?

458
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:43,212
I just don't know what we have to do
to make these government interlopers happy.

459
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:45,741


460
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:47,414
we do it,
and then suddenly

461
00:25:47,728 --> 00:25:49,067
that's not good enough.

462
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,899
Might as well be
living in Russia.

463
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:52,990
Mm. Damn straight.

464
00:25:57,571 --> 00:26:00,031
You know, this morning
I got a call

465
00:26:00,151 --> 00:26:02,013
from my competitors
at Brown & Williamson,

466
00:26:02,133 --> 00:26:04,573
and they're getting sued
by the federal government

467
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:06,145
because of the health claims they made.

468
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,853
Yeah, we're aware of that, Mr. Garner,

469
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,606
but you have to realize that through
the manipulation of the mass media,

470
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:14,693
the public is under the impression
that your cigarettes are linked to...

471
00:26:15,436 --> 00:26:17,145
certain fatal diseases.

472
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:21,026
Manipulation of the media?
Hell, that's what I pay you for.

473
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,093
Our product is fine.
I smoke 'em myself.

474
00:26:24,213 --> 00:26:25,474
My granddad smoked 'em.

475
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:26,936
He died at 95 years old.

476
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:28,194
He was hit by a truck.

477
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,384
I understand.

478
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:33,375
But our hands are tied. We're no longer 
allowed to advertise that Lucky Strikes are safe.

479
00:26:33,495 --> 00:26:36,614
What the hell are we gonna do?
We've already funded our own tobacco

480
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:39,490
research center to put this
 whole rumor to rest.

481
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,034
And that's a very good start.

482
00:26:41,362 --> 00:26:43,276
But it may not
affect sales.

483
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,630
Don, I think maybe
that's your cue.

484
00:26:48,994 --> 00:26:50,539
Well, uh...

485
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,567
I have been, uh...

486
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:55,465
thinking quite a bit
about this,

487
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,569
and, uh...

488
00:27:08,548 --> 00:27:12,802
I mean, you know I'm a
Lucky Strike man from way back, so...

489
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:22,042
I might have a solution.

490
00:27:23,384 --> 00:27:26,746
At Sterling Cooper, we've been pioneering
the burgeoning field of research,

491
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:29,234
and our analysis shows
that the health risks

492
00:27:29,354 --> 00:27:31,894
associated with your product
is not the end of the world.

493
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,453
People get in their cars
every day to go to work,

494
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,271
and some of them die.

495
00:27:37,612 --> 00:27:39,485
Cars are dangerous.

496
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,795
There's nothing
you can do about it.

497
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:44,898
You still have to get
where you're going.

498
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:49,491
Cigarettes are exactly the same,
so why don't we simply say,

499
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:51,896
"So what if cigarettes are dangerous?

500
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:53,432
"You're a man.

501
00:27:53,897 --> 00:27:55,332
"The world is dangerous.

502
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,972
"Smoke your cigarette.

503
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:59,643
You still have to get
where you're going. "

504
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,677
That's very interesting.

505
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:06,601
I mean, if cigarettes
were dangerous,

506
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:07,708
- it would be interesting.

507
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:08,965
- Except they aren't.

508
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,674
That's your slogan?

509
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:13,448
"You're going to die anyway.
Die with us"?

510
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:16,953
Actually, it's a fairly well-established
psychological principle

511
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:19,659
that society has a death wish,

512
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,394
and if we could
just tap into that,

513
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:23,924
the market potential is...

514
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:26,480
What the hell are you talking about?
Are you insane?

515
00:28:26,736 --> 00:28:29,524
I'm not selling rifles here.
I'm in the tobacco business.

516
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,356
We're selling America.

517
00:28:31,657 --> 00:28:34,883
The Indian gave it to us, for shit sake.
<i>Come on, Dad.</i>

518
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:37,056
Let's get out of here.

519
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,305
The bright spot is, at least we know
 if we have this problem,

520
00:28:42,425 --> 00:28:43,855
everybody has this problem.

521
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:58,663
Gentlemen, before you leave,
can I just say something?

522
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:00,805
I don't know, Don. Can you?

523
00:29:04,262 --> 00:29:07,734
The Federal Trade Commission and 
Reader's Digest have done you a favor.

524
00:29:08,283 --> 00:29:12,588
They've let you know that any ad that brings 
up the concept of cigarettes and health together...

525
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:16,893
well, it's just gonna
make people think of cancer.

526
00:29:17,158 --> 00:29:19,467
Yes, and we're
grateful to them.

527
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:23,800
But what Lee, Jr.,
said is right.

528
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:28,056
If you can't make those health claims,
 neither can your competitors.

529
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:34,458
So we've got a lot of people
not saying anything that sells cigarettes.

530
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,095
Not exactly.

531
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:40,756
This is the greatest advertising opportunity
since the invention of cereal.

532
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:45,365
We have six identical companies
making six identical products.

533
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:47,883
We can say anything we want.

534
00:29:48,785 --> 00:29:50,042
How do you
make your cigarettes?

535
00:29:51,095 --> 00:29:52,133
I don't know.

536
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,293
Shame on you.

537
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:57,743
We breed insect-repellent
tobacco seeds,

538
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:01,160
plant them in the North Carolina
sunshine, grow it, cut it,

539
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,734
cure it, toast it...
<i>There you go.</i>

540
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:05,032
There you go.

541
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:14,890
But everybody else's
tobacco is toasted.

542
00:30:15,122 --> 00:30:18,403
No. Everybody else's
tobacco is poisonous.

543
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,782
Lucky Strike...
is toasted.

544
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:27,213
Gentlemen, I don't think I have to tell you
what you just witnessed here.

545
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,042
I think you do.

546
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:34,586
Advertising
is based on one thing:

547
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:36,636
happiness.

548
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,487
And you know what happiness is?

549
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:42,792
Happiness
is the smell of a new car.

550
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:45,751
It's freedom from fear.

551
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:48,389
It's a billboard
on the side of the road

552
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:51,737
that screams with reassurance
that whatever you're doing...

553
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:53,760
it's okay.

554
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:58,335
You are okay.

555
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:07,583
It's toasted.

556
00:31:10,973 --> 00:31:11,834
I get it.

557
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:23,955
You had me worried.

558
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:26,744
I don't know if you were drunk
or not drunk,

559
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:28,913
but that was inspired.

560
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:31,815
For the record,
I pulled it out of thin air,

561
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,250
so thank you, up there.

562
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,068
You're looking
in the wrong direction.

563
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,094
So now that I've got you
in the afterglow here,

564
00:31:38,214 --> 00:31:40,308
what do you say you reconsider
this presidential campaign?

565
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,548
I don't know.
Bunting and babies?

566
00:31:43,786 --> 00:31:44,578
That's hard work.

567
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,218
I would make hash of it.

568
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,282
Modesty.
That's adorable.

569
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:51,459
Consider the product: he's young, handsome,
Navy hero.

570
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:55,108
Honestly, it shouldn't be too difficult
to convince America Dick Nixon is a winner.

571
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:56,890
Mr. Draper,
you've got visitors.

572
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:00,116
Could you be a little
more specific, honey?

573
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,675
We heard
you saved the day.

574
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:06,559
Aw, thank you, boys.
I appreciate it.

575
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:08,459
I told them
how amazing you were.

576
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:09,680
I'm still tingling.

577
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,329
Looks like you're all going to engage
in a little mid-level camaraderie,

578
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:15,434
so I'll be on my way.
Don, thanks again for the home run.

579
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:16,341
I love to come through.

580
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:19,389
Any chance you could patch things up
with Rachel Menken?

581
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:21,303
Any way you can be as charming
as I said you were?

582
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:23,591
Haven't you had enough of my magic
for one day?

583
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:25,723
She's worth $3 million.

584
00:32:26,393 --> 00:32:27,404
You're a whore.

585
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,414
Peggy...

586
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,328
Could she get us a little more ice?

587
00:32:33,448 --> 00:32:34,512
Yes, Mr. Draper?

588
00:32:34,632 --> 00:32:35,346
Just a minute.

589
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,997
Fellas, I think this party's gonna
have to move elsewhere.

590
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:41,775
We'll move wherever you want, but it's 5:15.
The bachelor party's underway.

591
00:32:42,172 --> 00:32:42,855
I don't know.

592
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:45,129
Oh, come on, Don.
All hands on deck.

593
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:47,056
Aren't you gonna help
give Pete his big sendoff?

594
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:48,410
Maybe next time.

595
00:32:51,612 --> 00:32:52,254
Come on, guys.

596
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:54,045
Come on, guys.
Don will join us later, right?

597
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:04,150
If Greta's research was any good,
I would have used it.

598
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,033
What are you
talking about?

599
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:09,480
I'm saying I had a report
just like that.

600
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:13,986
And it's not like there's some magic machine
that makes identical copies of things.

601
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:17,321
I still think
she was right.

602
00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:24,023
Have a great night, Pete.

603
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:26,034
Congratulations.

604
00:33:35,456 --> 00:33:37,096
I heard you were
amazing in the meeting.

605
00:33:38,162 --> 00:33:40,185
Fear stimulates
my imagination.

606
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:44,518
I just wanted to thank you
for a great first day,

607
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:47,521
and for, you know...

608
00:33:49,284 --> 00:33:51,649
standing up for me
with Mr. Campbell.

609
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,652
First of all, Peggy,
I'm your boss,

610
00:34:07,772 --> 00:34:08,763
not your boyfriend.

611
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,676
Second of all, you ever let Pete Campbell
go through my trash again,

612
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:16,409
and you won't be able to find a job
selling sandwiches in Penn Station.

613
00:34:19,296 --> 00:34:21,578
He said he left
his fountain pen in here.

614
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:23,109
I didn't know.

615
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:28,945
I hope you don't think
I'm that kind of girl.

616
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:31,098
Of course not.

617
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:33,668
Go home.

618
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:34,925
Put your curlers in.

619
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,360
We'll get a fresh start
tomorrow.

620
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:40,050
Oh. And, Peggy,

621
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,874
I need you
to place a call.

622
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:03,118
I want to see you here every 15 minutes,
whether you have drinks or not.

623
00:35:03,238 --> 00:35:04,799
Uh, every five minutes.

624
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:07,902
Let's live here.

625
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:10,555
Better do more
than look tonight.

626
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,140
Do you have a girlfriend,
Salvatore?

627
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,806
Is there some kind
of party here?

628
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:19,950
How did you swing it?

629
00:35:20,264 --> 00:35:21,850
They work at the Automat.

630
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,878
He pressed a button,
and they came out.

631
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,461
I do hope we're not
interrupting anything.

632
00:35:26,581 --> 00:35:27,103
Definitely not.

633
00:35:27,223 --> 00:35:28,634
Well, I have the best seat.

634
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:29,482
What are we drinking?

635
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:31,827
More of whatever's making you
the way you are.

636
00:35:31,947 --> 00:35:33,221
I love this place.

637
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:35,968
It's hot, loud,
and filled with men.

638
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,005
I know what you mean.

639
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:52,050
Oh, my God. I can
hardly feel it.

640
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:54,534
I have a feeling you're
like this all the time.

641
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:55,846
I like to laugh.

642
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:56,994
Is that right?

643
00:35:57,841 --> 00:35:59,263
Now,
you stop that.

644
00:35:59,564 --> 00:36:00,862
You said you like
to laugh.

645
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:03,107
I mean it.

646
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,977
It's... It's too...
<i>Too delicious.</i>

647
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,631
I said stop it.

648
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:10,228
- What do you think you're doing?
<i>- You know exactly.</i>

649
00:36:11,062 --> 00:36:12,743
You know what, girls?
I think we should go.

650
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:13,768
Oh, come on.

651
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:15,627
You're hurting me.

652
00:36:18,464 --> 00:36:19,284
I'll be good.

653
00:36:21,581 --> 00:36:23,152
Buy the girls whatever they want.

654
00:36:29,846 --> 00:36:31,732
So, uh, what do you fellas do?

655
00:36:31,978 --> 00:36:34,247
You're looking at the finest
ad men in New York.

656
00:36:34,367 --> 00:36:35,934
Hell, the world.

657
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:02,007
For the lady, a special Mai Tai,

658
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:04,016
and one whiskey neat.

659
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:13,133
So you're going
to play me with drinks

660
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:15,620
and convince me
what a terrible mistake I'm making.

661
00:37:16,509 --> 00:37:17,698
That is quite a drink.

662
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:20,870
You got in trouble,
didn't you?

663
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,325
I shouldn't
have lost my temper,

664
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:28,830
and I certainly shouldn't have treated 
you like anything less than a client.

665
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,704
Apology accepted.

666
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,176
So you understand.

667
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:35,201
Now I do.

668
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:38,891
It was, uh,
refreshing, really.

669
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:43,306
I mean, actually hearing all the things
I always assumed people were thinking.

670
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,493
Well, I'm not really
as bad as all that.

671
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,339
I was under
a lot of pressure.

672
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,212
Another account.

673
00:37:56,178 --> 00:37:57,435
Doesn't really matter.

674
00:37:58,378 --> 00:37:59,472
No, it doesn't.

675
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:06,366
So, without
making things worse,

676
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:09,797
can I ask you a personal question?
<i>Don't you want to get a second drink in me first?</i>

677
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:11,956
Why aren't you married?

678
00:38:14,121 --> 00:38:15,912
Are you asking
what's wrong with me?

679
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:18,309
It's just that you're
a beautiful, educated woman.

680
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,960
Don't you think that getting married
and having a family would make you happier

681
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,929
than all the headaches
that go along with

682
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:24,815
fighting people like me?

683
00:38:27,977 --> 00:38:31,441
If I weren't a woman, I would be
allowed to ask you the same question,

684
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:35,200
and if I weren't a woman, I wouldn't 
have to choose between

685
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:37,538
putting on an apron

686
00:38:37,658 --> 00:38:40,968
and the thrill of making my father's store
what I always thought it should be.

687
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:44,153
So that's it.
You won't get married because

688
00:38:44,918 --> 00:38:46,545
you find business to be a thrill.

689
00:38:47,297 --> 00:38:48,883
That and...

690
00:38:52,136 --> 00:38:53,598
I've never been in love.

691
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,267
She won't get married
because she's never been in love.

692
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,041
I think I wrote that
once to sell nylons.

693
00:39:00,844 --> 00:39:03,400
For a lot of people,
love isn't just a slogan.

694
00:39:04,621 --> 00:39:07,559
Oh, you mean love. You mean the big
lightning bolt to the heart

695
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,760
where you can't eat
and you can't work

696
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,657
and you just run off
and get married

697
00:39:12,777 --> 00:39:14,467
and make babies.

698
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:17,993
The reason
you haven't felt it

699
00:39:18,113 --> 00:39:19,612
is because
it doesn't exist.

700
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,660
What you call love
was invented by guys like me

701
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:24,245
to sell nylons.

702
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:27,103
Is that right?

703
00:39:27,677 --> 00:39:28,715
I'm pretty sure
about it.

704
00:39:30,694 --> 00:39:32,593
You're born alone,
and you die alone,

705
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:34,220
and this world just drops
a bunch of rules on you

706
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,147
to make you
forget those facts,

707
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:37,732
but I never forget.

708
00:39:39,405 --> 00:39:41,346
I'm living like there's
no tomorrow...

709
00:39:42,494 --> 00:39:43,957
because there isn't one.

710
00:39:46,212 --> 00:39:49,015
I don't think I realized
until this moment,

711
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:54,017
but it must be hard
being a man, too.

712
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:56,957
Excuse me?

713
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:00,223
- Mr. Draper...
- Don.

714
00:40:00,343 --> 00:40:03,915
Mr. Draper, I don't know
what it is you really believe in,

715
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:07,756
but I do know
what it feels like to be out of place,

716
00:40:08,877 --> 00:40:10,544
to be disconnected,

717
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,643
to see the whole world laid out in front 
of you the way other people live it.

718
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:18,363
There is something
about you

719
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,386
that tells me
you know it, too.

720
00:40:26,573 --> 00:40:28,336
I don't know if that's true.

721
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:31,781
You want another drink?

722
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:33,601
No.

723
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:37,770
But you can tell your boss
that you charmed me.

724
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,356
So I guess we'll be
seeing each other again.

725
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:50,661
I'll be back in the office
Monday morning, for a real meeting.

726
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:52,930
I'd like that.

727
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:10,125
We're not buying anything.

728
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:11,068
Actually,

729
00:41:11,724 --> 00:41:12,899
for the first time today,

730
00:41:13,019 --> 00:41:14,162
I'm not selling anything.

731
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,199
Does Peggy live here?

732
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:17,634
Hold on.

733
00:41:30,243 --> 00:41:31,541
Do you know him?

734
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:35,286
It's okay, Marjorie.
We work together.

735
00:41:36,557 --> 00:41:39,004
He's really drunk.
<i>It's okay, Marjorie.</i>

736
00:41:42,116 --> 00:41:42,703
So...

737
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,519
what are you doing?

738
00:41:46,691 --> 00:41:50,190
Nothing. Just, uh, sitting in my room
listening to records.

739
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,597
I'm getting married
on Sunday.

740
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,475
I heard that.

741
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:57,958
You must think I'm a creep.

742
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,265
Why are you here?

743
00:42:12,161 --> 00:42:14,074
I wanted to see you tonight.

744
00:42:18,655 --> 00:42:19,188
Me?

745
00:42:20,692 --> 00:42:21,840
I had to see you.

746
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:32,759
Marjorie.

747
00:42:33,415 --> 00:42:34,112
<i>Yeah, Peg?</i>

748
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:36,654
I'm going
to bed now.

749
00:43:59,551 --> 00:44:00,890
I called the office.

750
00:44:01,246 --> 00:44:02,435
They said you'd left.

751
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:07,705
I didn't want
to bother you.

752
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:09,140
It's no bother.

753
00:44:09,796 --> 00:44:12,776
I just assumed you were staying
in the city again.

754
00:44:15,168 --> 00:44:16,288
There's a plate
in the oven.

755
00:44:23,137 --> 00:44:24,449
Unless
you're not hungry.

756
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,053
I'm not.

757
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:31,222
I'll be right back.

758
00:44:33,108 --> 00:44:34,065
Don't move.
