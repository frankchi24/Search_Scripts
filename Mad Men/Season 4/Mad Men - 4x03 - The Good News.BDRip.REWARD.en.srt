1
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,628
Remind me,
when did you stop taking the pills?

2
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,462
They ran out on the 2nd.

3
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,844
I'd say I would expect to be fertile again
at the end of the cycle,

4
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,925
although from my experience,
it's more likely a month.

5
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,849
All this time I've been afraid to skip one,
but it could take a month?

6
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,979
Why don't you join him for basic training?
It would boost the men's morale.

7
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,358
From what I remember,
San Antonio is lovely this time of year.

8
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,065
We don't know when he's going.

9
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,243
You've been married two years, Joan?
Most gals your age don't wait.

10
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,367
We have a plan.

11
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,914
JoJo, I know it's none of my business,

12
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,122
but I only went to Korea
because they made me.

13
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,751
I didn't have a choice or a wife.

14
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:23,209
All I want to know is
if my husband and I can start a family...

15
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,511
When my husband and I can start a family.

16
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,131
Go get them.

17
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,434
-Walter.
-Yes?

18
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,599
I just want to make sure that...

19
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,931
Well, you know I've had
a couple of procedures.

20
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,063
I just want to make sure
they don't affect anything.

21
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,194
A couple? I only remember one.

22
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,907
There was one before that.
Should I be worried?

23
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,245
Was the other performed by a physician?

24
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,156
She said she was a midwife.

25
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,249
Well, you got pregnant subsequently,
and I know everything went fine here.

26
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,171
And, physically, everything looks fine.

27
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,294
Like the song says,
"Whatever will be, will be."

28
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:07,962
Happy New Year.

29
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,398
-Good morning, Mr. Draper.
-Good morning, Allison.

30
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,024
Coffee?

31
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,731
Yes, please.

32
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,626
I'm glad I caught you before you left.

33
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,666
The flight's not until 12:30.

34
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,081
Well, still, you've got to tight the tourists
for a taxi,

35
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,963
and then if you hit traffic,
Triborough Bridge,

36
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,761
somebody's always running out of gas,
and I think you know who.

37
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,139
So I saw, on your way to Acapulco,
you have 24 hours in Los Angeles.

38
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,390
What do you want?

39
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,101
The Brown Derby, Bill Asher.
He'll probably try to cast you.

40
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,974
-Morning, Don, Harry.
-Hello.

41
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,059
-Am I interrupting?
-No.

42
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,104
I'll see you at the traffic meeting
this afternoon.

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,313
We're still doing that? Why?

44
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,650
Just go to England already.
Stop feeling guilty.

45
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,154
Take two weeks. You'll be twice as happy.

46
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,904
I'm happy when I'm working.

47
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,660
And I'm sure another day and a half of work
will not come close

48
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,208
to the amount of fiddling about
you did in Los Angeles this year.

49
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,419
Okay. Happy New Year, Don.

50
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:30,344
There you are.
Please make sure he signs these.

51
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,638
If I don't see you, happy New Year.

52
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,306
Enjoy your family.

53
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,145
-Would you like to sign these now?
-Might as well.

54
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,944
So, what will you be doing?

55
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,610
Don't worry. I'll be here till the bitter end.

56
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,526
No, I mean for New Year's.

57
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,077
I'm gonna go see my sister in Paterson
over the weekend,

58
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,248
and, I don't know, probably Times Square.

59
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,619
I always wondered who did that.

60
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,994
It was a little scary last year,

61
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,205
but I think we'll have a whole bunch of girls
this time.

62
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,216
-And sailors.
-I'm sure.

63
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,670
But for the rest of the week, if you want me
or someone else on your desk

64
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,473
-for West Coast hours, I can arrange that.
-I'll be fine.

65
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,134
Well, I'll let you know
when you should leave.

66
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,560
Thank you.

67
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,268
Why is the door shut?

68
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,649
I don't like pipe smoke.
He's very considerate.

69
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,154
-Could you tell him I'm here?
-What is this regarding?

70
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,413
Sorry to bother you,
but since Roger's not here,

71
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,617
I am sending Caroline uptown
to get me some fried chicken for lunch,

72
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,576
and I know you like it. Interested?

73
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,957
I am.

74
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,663
Breast? Thigh?

75
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,460
One of each.

76
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,882
I wanted to ask you,
I would like to put in a request now

77
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,134
for a few days off
the second week of January.

78
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,012
But you have New Year's off.

79
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,261
My husband's a doctor.
His schedule's not flexible.

80
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,064
Why don't you go home
and ask him how he would feel

81
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,188
about some nurse asking for a holiday
immediately following a holiday?

82
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,146
I would be happy with two days.

83
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,898
Our financial planning and expense budgets
for next year,

84
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,028
I'll need you to assist me.

85
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,361
We can do it now.
No one Knows why we're here anyway.

86
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,076
Because there's work to do.

87
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,284
And I understand that all men are dizzy
and powerless to refuse you,

88
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,711
but consider me the incorruptible exception.

89
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,208
Fried chicken indeed.

90
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,791
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

91
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,296
Now don't go and cry about it.

92
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,801
Excuse me?

93
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,423
I said, don't go and cry about it.

94
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,675
Hey.

95
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,848
Get off my porch.

96
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,181
You actually came.

97
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,440
What the hell happened to your leg?

98
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,902
It's broken.
It didn't work that well to begin with.

99
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:38,948
How are you?

100
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,536
You just need a little R&R.

101
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,669
What happened?

102
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,589
Here's the lesson.
Don't fry eggs in bare feet.

103
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,961
Sit down.

104
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,677
-What do you want?
-Half of what you have.

105
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:02,969
You've got a leak.

106
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,143
I fixed the roof. It just needs a little makeup.

107
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,890
Call a painter.

108
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:12,599
I don't know. Once it stopped smelling,
I kind of forgot about it.

109
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,565
I wondered whose car that was. Hello, Dick-

110
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,156
-Hello, Patty. it's been too long.
-Stephanie.

111
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,077
Stephanie. Last time I saw you,
you didn't have front teeth.

112
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,619
They're helping me
while I'm in my fragile state,

113
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,294
although no one asked them to.

114
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,587
Can I get you something?

115
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,883
No, we live in South Pasadena.
It's a long drive.

116
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,922
-Are you staying?
-Just for the night.

117
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,137
-Here?
-Patty,

118
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,848
remember you told me to tell you
if you were intruding?

119
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,392
Try to keep her off her feet.

120
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,353
The cast isn't stable,
and we don't need any more accidents.

121
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:55,271
Aunt Anna, I just left everything on the bed.
I don't Know where things go.

122
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,852
You can tell by looking.

123
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,113
She's never gotten over me
flunking home-ec.

124
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,321
Dick, fix her a drink.

125
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,116
-Are you drinking age?
-Yes, but don't bother.

126
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,375
Stephanie is studying Poli Sci at Cal.
She should be studying music.

127
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,540
Berkeley? Are you sitting in?

128
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,925
I agree with what they're doing,
but somebody's gotta go to class.

129
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,138
-Steph, are you ready?
-Why don't you two stay for dinner?

130
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,102
Glenn and I have a bridge game
at the Dicksons',

131
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,054
and he's expecting a dinner of his own.

132
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,731
Good, 'cause I only want her to stay.

133
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:36,979
How will she get home?

134
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,059
I have a car.

135
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,403
Or she'll spend the night.
You can get her in the morning.

136
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,784
Okay, you figure it out.
Good night, sweetheart.

137
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,406
You know I'm very grateful.

138
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,918
-If I don't see you, Dick, happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

139
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,341
I'm going to wash the road off me,

140
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,135
and then we are going to that place
with the beer and abalone.

141
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,884
Perfect. Sounds like there's towels
all over the bed.

142
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,258
Why am I staying?

143
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,265
I wanted him to meet you,
and I know you've got grass.

144
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,023
Hello.

145
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,610
Come over here.

146
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,862
Is that your dinner?

147
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,693
I love your chicken.

148
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,201
How was the doctor?

149
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,450
Everything's good.

150
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,452
Good. I have to go.

151
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,415
Let me at least heat it up.
You can take it with you.

152
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,677
Peabody's offered his place in the Poconos
for the 14th and 15th.

153
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,463
Greg, I can't get away, not then.

154
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,142
Jeanie, I have to work New Year's.
I had to trade it for January.

155
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,720
Then get one of the Jewish docs to do it.
You worked on their holiday.

156
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:59,649
Jeanie, you don't think
I'd rather be smelling perfume than Lysol?

157
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,816
Tell me what you want me to do.

158
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,899
Because it's not your problem, too?

159
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,281
Why don't you just not show up?

160
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,825
I'll lose my job.

161
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,656
-We'll make it.
-Until when?

162
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,321
Until I leave for basic,

163
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,576
and then it's just a couple of weeks,
and then I'll be home.

164
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,624
And then you're going to Vietnam.

165
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,917
We don't know that.

166
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,249
That makes me feel better.

167
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,955
Just keep marking off the days
on the calendar

168
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,585
while I keep planning for our future.

169
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,715
I'll see you tomorrow
when you're on your way out.

170
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,757
You don't even know when you're going!

171
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,432
Soon.

172
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,315
So I'd say Laura was the worst roommate.

173
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,942
She had a nervous breakdown-

174
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:47,739
One morning, she's reading the Bible
instead of her psych book.

175
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:53,411
The next morning she woke me up,
leaning over me with this crazy smile

176
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,707
and said, "Morning, Stephanie.
Have you heard the good news?"

177
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,872
There are worse things.

178
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,707
No, there aren't.

179
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,922
Where did you go to school, Dick?

180
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,170
I strung together
a few nonconsecutive years

181
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,847
in night school, City College.

182
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,932
A self-made man.

183
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,600
What's it like taking off your suit
and returning to the wild?

184
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,057
I really don't like
how political you're getting.

185
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,737
I'm not political.
I just don't understand who's in charge.

186
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,568
You're in charge.

187
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,649
Trust me. I work in advertising.

188
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,484
You're kidding me.

189
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,944
It's pollution.

190
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,862
So stop buying things.

191
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:39,541
Don't think that's not possible.

192
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,796
I'll say this in terms you'll understand.

193
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:48,842
I will be right back after this brief message
from Jan and Dean.

194
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,881
I like to think I had a bit of a hand in that.

195
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,216
You and God.

196
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:00,766
Young people are gonna save us.

197
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,519
How would you feel
about me bringing the kids out this spring?

198
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,271
Really?

199
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,109
You know how badly
I've wanted to meet them.

200
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,531
So what, I'll be their aunt?

201
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,364
Wait till they tell Betty that.

202
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,080
You told me you told her everything.
She'll understand.

203
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,792
I don't think she'll ever understand.

204
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,620
You had to know she'd be hurt.

205
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,628
After I told her, I felt relieved.

206
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,134
I kept thinking how small it was
compared to how long it went on.

207
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,970
-Small?
-I know. I know.

208
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,398
It's just...

209
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,866
I could tell.

210
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,153
The minute she saw who I really was,

211
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,874
she never wanted to look at me again.

212
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,667
Which is why I never told her.

213
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,673
Dick.

214
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,673
I'm sorry she broke your heart.

215
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,518
I had it coming.

216
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,646
I thought I'd play something
so you two could dance.

217
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,978
How the hell am I gonna dance?

218
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,989
I don't know how you ever danced to this.

219
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,316
Come on.

220
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,369
Keep your hands at 10:00 and 2:00.

221
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,964
So you picked this song because it's old?

222
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,096
That doesn't mean it's bad.

223
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,593
It's kind of corny.

224
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:07,940
I think it sounds like she's inviting us
to a very beautiful place

225
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,567
where there's no surfing at all.

226
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,812
Have you ever been there?

227
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,565
No.

228
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:24,494
But every time I hear this song, I want to go.

229
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,353
I know for a fact
you did not break that leg making eggs.

230
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,150
I used to love sitting,
and now that I have to, I hate it.

231
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,606
I should get home.

232
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,073
I'll drive you. I'll put the top up.

233
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,616
That's okay. I'll hitch.

234
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,070
I do it all the time.

235
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,780
You'll get picked up by some creep.

236
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,908
I guess this is safer.

237
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,960
So, are you married or divorced?

238
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,804
Couldn't I just be single?

239
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:26,977
No. I mean, I'd be surprised.

240
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,562
I'm divorced.

241
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,017
Do you go on those dates
where you sit there

242
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,979
and ask each other questions?

243
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,279
It's a means to an end.

244
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,029
But nobody knows
what's wrong with themselves,

245
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:51,376
and everyone else can see it right away.

246
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,512
-Thank you very much.
-it's my pleasure.

247
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,017
So, what time's your flight tomorrow?

248
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,391
Noon.

249
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,184
Unless you think I should change it.

250
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,522
What are you doing?

251
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,241
I don't know.

252
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,330
You're so beautiful and young.

253
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:40,759
Anna and I
never had a romantic relationship.

254
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,923
But you love her.

255
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,218
For lots of reasons.

256
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,178
And in a very different way.

257
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,105
I have to tell you something,

258
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,729
and I probably shouldn't.

259
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,526
I promised I wouldn't,

260
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,788
but I see you two together,
and I know I have to.

261
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,406
Okay.

262
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,667
Anna is...

263
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,626
She has cancer-

264
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,673
-What?
-it's why she broke her leg.

265
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,389
It's in her bones. it's all over her body.

266
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,270
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,026
Cancer. Shit.

268
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,237
I'm so sorry.

269
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,362
Of course she's not gonna say a damn thing.

270
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,614
She doesn't know.

271
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,951
What?

272
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,748
The doctors said she doesn't have long,
so there's no reason to tell her.

273
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,874
Some quacks out in Pedro?
What are you going to do about it?

274
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,958
My mom got a consultation.

275
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,802
Your mother does not get to decide that.

276
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,219
Please don't make me sorry that I told you.

277
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:16,725
I didn't want you to leave here
and not know.

278
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:23,852
Good morning.

279
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,686
I woke up in a panic
because I thought I might've missed you-

280
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,862
But it doesn't look like you're ready to go.

281
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,324
-I thought I'd stay a little longer, if it's okay.
-Hell yes.

282
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,151
Stay as long as you want.

283
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,361
We'll see.

284
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,875
If I had rolled over on this,
I would've had to smoke the dress.

285
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,471
How'd you sleep?

286
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,221
I was feeling no pain, as they say.

287
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,896
In fact, I don't know if I would've woken up
if I hadn't heard that jet fly by.

288
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,645
And I thought,
"Oh, my God. Dick left already."

289
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,438
There's all kinds of aircraft here, you know.

290
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:17,152
If we stay up tonight and we get lucky,
we'll see something you'll remember.

291
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,242
If we keep smoking that.

292
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,158
I've seen UFOs.

293
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,915
There was a lot going on
during the missile scare,

294
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,837
but it was different.

295
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,957
You saw a UFO?

296
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,210
You don't have to do that, you know.

297
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,928
I want to.

298
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:41,472
I'm not gonna fight watching Dick Whitman
paint my living room in his shorts.

299
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,890
I'm so damn proud of you.

300
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,978
I count on it.

301
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,732
Does that scare you?

302
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,656
The idea of another civilization
on another planet

303
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,703
smart enough to find a way to get here?

304
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,958
It doesn't scare me,
but the odds are against it.

305
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,293
Well, I saw something once,

306
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,293
and I'm telling you, it knocked me sideways.

307
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:16,132
I started thinking of everything
I was sure was true

308
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,926
and how flimsy it all might be.

309
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,929
You don't need to see a UFO to know that.

310
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,096
That's not a great way to think about things.

311
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:40,117
I know everything about you,
and I still love you.

312
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,866
Are you just gonna paint that corner?

313
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,419
'Cause a patch of new paint
is just as bad as a stain.

314
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,420
What the hell is going on?

315
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,930
You're gonna get arrested.

316
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,349
No, you are. That's breaking and entering.

317
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,926
I thought you had a flight to catch.

318
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:06,723
I changed my plans.

319
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,931
You just can't keep your pants on, can you?

320
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,856
You never know what's gonna set her off.

321
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,614
-I need to talk to you.
-I bet.

322
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,959
I heard your car pull up at 2:30.
She's half your age.

323
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,377
What's your plan?

324
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:35,127
Just gonna let her wake up one day in agony
and you tell her it's over?

325
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,714
I'm going to assume

326
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,216
that you've done everything
in your limited means,

327
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,764
but I'm here now.

328
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,718
She's gonna see some real doctors,
and she's not gonna live in the dark.

329
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,146
We showed the X-rays
to specialists, everybody.

330
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,351
It's very advanced.

331
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,397
Specialists? You don't think she knows
something's going on?

332
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:59,356
She had polio. She's been going to doctors
since she was eight. Maybe...

333
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,906
I don't know.

334
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,656
She hasn't let on,
so this is the way it's gonna be.

335
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,154
I understand you feel guilty, but don't.

336
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,911
Go to Acapulco.
There's nothing for you to do here.

337
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,285
She is very important to me.

338
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,415
I'm gonna do what I have to.

339
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,631
You have no say in the affairs of this family.

340
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,178
You're just a man in a room
with a checkbook. I'm sorry.

341
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,182
Please do the decent thing.

342
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,361
The longer you're here,
the more likely you are to say something.

343
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,701
She thinks you brought the pot, I bet.

344
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,709
If it wasn't for my niece,
we'd have killed each other by now.

345
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,542
She means well, and she's family.

346
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,803
I wouldn't have picked her.

347
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:09,224
I'm just saying not everybody has that.

348
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,389
You have your kids. I bet that's better.

349
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,061
It's different.

350
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,159
I have to tell you something.

351
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,449
What's wrong?

352
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,248
I have to go.

353
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,385
I'm sorry.

354
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,343
I thought I could stay, but I can't.

355
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,102
I don't care.

356
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,097
I want you to.

357
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,601
I want you to do everything you want to do.

358
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:02,945
I'll bring the kids out at Easter.

359
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,777
We'll go to Catalina, see the bison.

360
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:16,913
Acapulco.

361
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,080
Do you think there's more Mexicans here
or there?

362
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,510
Joan.

363
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,380
Open it.

364
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,515
They're beautiful.

365
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,855
It's so encouraging to see someone
happily married around here.

366
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,238
Peggy, why don't you go home?

367
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,157
I'll tell everyone
you have something important to do.

368
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,110
Really? I have to buy a dress.

369
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:54,659
New Year's Eve, big group of girls,
you'll want to stand out.

370
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,912
No, I'm spending it with Mark.
My boyfriend?

371
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,873
Happy New Year.

372
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,339
Excuse me.

373
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:08,211
-"Darling, I've been an ass. Kisses, Lane"?
-What?

374
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,046
I am not your darling,
and I don't want your kisses.

375
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,215
-What?
-I thought American men were bad enough,

376
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,392
but none of them has ever so consistently

377
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,682
made me feel like
a helpless, stupid little girl.

378
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:22,267
Calm down. I did send you flowers,
but I also sent flowers to my wife in London.

379
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,193
The sentiments were very different,
I assure you. Sandy!

380
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,824
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

381
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,243
Just get back to work. Sandy!

382
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,707
Did it ever occur to you
how sensitive these deliveries were?

383
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,622
How often do I send flowers?

384
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,416
I ordered the flowers from Rhinelander's.

385
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:46,875
They assured me they were going
to contact your florist in London,

386
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,926
and somehow they mixed them up.
It's not my fault.

387
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,424
Sandra, everyone makes mistakes,

388
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,966
but the fact that you're the kind of person
who cannot accept blame is egregious.

389
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,602
I don't know what that means.

390
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,597
It means I can't believe I hired you.

391
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,058
You had one simple task.

392
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,148
I don't even know if I can call to apologize.

393
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,480
What exactly did Mrs. Harris' note say?

394
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,905
It said, "Joan, forgive me. Lane."

395
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,494
You're fired. Go get your things.
You'll be paid through the end of the year.

396
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,540
Those instructions you understood!

397
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,297
I'll have Megan clean this up.

398
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,759
What are you doing?

399
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,928
You inspired me.

400
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,518
Would you like to sign your work?

401
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,267
-Really?
-Pick a spot on the wall.

402
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,524
You should swim as much as you can there.

403
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,450
It'll clear your head.

404
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,320
But no cliff diving.

405
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,096
Hey. You'll be fine.

406
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,645
You'll make the best of it. You always do.

407
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:31,271
You know you can call me
if you need anything.

408
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,576
Goodbye, Anna.

409
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,952
Goodbye, Dick.

410
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,290
Mn Draper?

411
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,834
Mr. Draper?

412
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,345
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.

413
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,691
Hey, what are you doing up?

414
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,900
I figured since we missed it here,
we could celebrate it in Hawaii.

415
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,205
Look at that.

416
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,034
I'm sorry. I ate dinner at 3:00.

417
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,628
A bowl of cottage cheese in the cafeteria?

418
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,921
How about a glass
of fresh-squeezed orange juice?

419
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,047
Sure.

420
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:41,094
The nurses spent five minutes
trying to get this girl's contact lenses out.

421
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,345
She was screaming.

422
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:45,519
It turns out her friend was the one
with the contact lenses.

423
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,101
God!

424
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,309
-Oh, God.
-Let me see.

425
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,940
-I cut it really bad, Greg. It really hurts.
-Jesus.

426
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,152
Hold this.

427
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,363
-Just take me to the hospital.
-Sit down.

428
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,875
Greg, you don't have to do this.

429
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,748
Would you stop?

430
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:22,928
Isn't there some medical ethical law
against operating on your wife?

431
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,564
I want you to calm down.

432
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:43,118
For me, this is like,
I don't know, filing some papers is for you.

433
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,612
I do it all the time.

434
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,455
I don't do that anymore.
I have other people do that.

435
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,329
It's really throbbing. Let me get my coat.

436
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,123
Hey, since when have we had
that bird's nest on the ceiling?

437
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,586
I usually save that for kids.

438
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,463
Now, don't move.

439
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:07,392
One hillbilly says to the other,

440
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,812
"You wanna play 20 questions?"

441
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,479
The other hillbilly says, "What is that?"

442
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:19,693
He says,
"I write something on a piece of paper,

443
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,325
"and you get 20 questions
to guess what it be."

444
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,489
So he takes out a piece of paper
and writes "donkey dick" on it.

445
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,416
The other hillbilly takes a second to think

446
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,836
and asks, "Can I eat it?"

447
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:39,508
The other hillbilly says,
"I might reckon you could."

448
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,502
The other one says,

449
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,842
"Is it donkey dick?"

450
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,226
Cohen told me that.

451
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,771
Come on. it's fine.

452
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,525
I'm not crying 'cause it hurts.

453
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,774
Everything's gonna be okay.

454
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,358
When?

455
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,204
Jeanie.

456
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,708
I can't fix anything else,

457
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,795
but I can fix this.

458
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,151
Hello?

459
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,237
Hello?

460
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,829
I thought you were in Acapulco.

461
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,166
I didn't feel like it.

462
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,335
You should be in England with your family.

463
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,006
Too much to do.
They'll be back soon enough.

464
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,836
I have a sandwich in the refrigerator.
It's very large.

465
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,844
No, thank you. Do you mind?

466
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,177
Help yourself.

467
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:23,025
I received something rather special
from my father

468
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,321
-for my birthday.
-What is it?

469
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,282
Who knows?

470
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,784
He's one of those alcoholics
who thinks that he's collecting.

471
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,079
Chin-chin.

472
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,710
-There's no...
-No bite at all.

473
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:50,885
Well,

474
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,557
I will let you get back to your business.

475
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:05,813
I made a discovery
as I slowly pulled back from the records.

476
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,817
I can't take any more bad news, Lane.

477
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,822
Although things are precarious financially,

478
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,835
it's been a magnificent year.

479
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,128
Lane!

480
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,050
-What?
-Come here.

481
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,146
We're going to the movies.

482
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:49,740
-Do you think we should?
-Does Howdy Doody have a wooden dick?

483
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,528
Zorba the Greek, seen it,
but would see it again.

484
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,494
It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World. No kidding.

485
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,748
-Send Me No Flowers.
-No.

486
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,749
The Guns of August.

487
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,793
I hate guns and I hate August.

488
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,214
It's all over the rug.

489
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,096
We'll have to smoke the dress.

490
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,303
Well, I don't know that one.

491
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,064
The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.

492
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,773
Catherine Deneuve.

493
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:30,364
Apparently, it's for all the young lovers
of the world.

494
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,955
This movie is very good.

495
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:46,584
You know what's going on here, don't you?

496
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,418
-Handjobs.
-ls that right?

497
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,880
What percentage do you think?

498
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,423
Do you mind?

499
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,345
Monster!

500
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,433
You like it here?

501
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:10,146
I do. I do. Even alone.

502
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,655
You remind me of a chap I knew in school.

503
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:21,324
We followed him around in a pack,
and he didn't notice we were there.

504
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,245
He died in a motorcycle crash.

505
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:33,965
Rebecca convinced me
that you were all on holiday together

506
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,921
without me.

507
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,179
I suppose we haven't been very welcoming.

508
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,891
Campbell's friendly,
although I believe unintentionally.

509
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:50,770
But my wife is quite severe with people,
including me.

510
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,273
I'm sorry to hear that.

511
00:37:56,441 --> 00:38:02,915
I wanted to bring our families
to New York for the holidays,

512
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:05,917
but she was terribly homesick.

513
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:12,879
We had an argument, a series of arguments,
and she left.

514
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,337
I then weakened and sent her flowers.

515
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,257
Tried to, anyway.

516
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:27,394
Then we had a rather solemn phone call
in which she told me she was not returning.

517
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,521
Then she put my son on the phone.

518
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,741
That's tough.

519
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,618
How did you know when you were done?

520
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,042
It wasn't my decision.

521
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,374
And I've learned the hard way
not to give advice in these situations.

522
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,258
You were supposed to tell me
to get on a plane.

523
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,257
Is that what you want?

524
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,892
Or is that what people expect of you?

525
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:08,601
I want my beef.

526
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,643
Here it is.

527
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:25,614
I was going to call a lady friend of mine.

528
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,120
I'm supposed to meet her downtown.

529
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,045
Do you want her to bring a friend?

530
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,874
No, no. No, thank you.

531
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,426
What are you gonna do?

532
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,681
We can pretend it's New Year's. It actually is.

533
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,021
If you don't mind.

534
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,652
It's the least I can do.

535
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,612
-I'm not hungry.
-What?

536
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:11,831
Not hungry
for this beautiful piece of American meat?

537
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,039
Look at me!

538
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,919
I got a big Texas belt buckle!

539
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,727
I'm thinking, "Did my mother get suspicious
and Call the fuzz?"

540
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:33,307
”We know you're practicing self-abuse.
Please come out with your hand up. ”

541
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,031
I see we have an anniversary here tonight.

542
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,035
Look at these two, George and Martha.

543
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,666
Tell me, what's it like when your eyes meet
across a crowded men 's room?

544
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,959
Wall Street, does it bother your parents
that he's so ugly?

545
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,801
So we all want to know
at the end of the night,

546
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,629
when it's just the two of you,
who picks up the check?

547
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,429
We're not homosexuals! We're divorced!

548
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,681
Don't.

549
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,480
Man- Now they're gonna fight in the car
all the way home.

550
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,774
"Honey why'd you provoke the comedian?"

551
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,612
Okay, now welcome
a talented young musician

552
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,692
whose mother says he's the next Bob Dylan.

553
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,628
-Candace, this is Lane.
-And this is my friend Janine.

554
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,125
-Hello.
-A pleasure.

555
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,048
I guess I was wrong. You're not queers.
You're rich.

556
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,881
A warm welcome for Rudy Jensen.

557
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:56,056
-You ladies look lovely.
-Why, thank you.

558
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,607
It's true.

559
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,151
I love this song.

560
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,697
-Really? He wrote it.
-Don't. She'll believe anything.

561
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,065
What?

562
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,075
Let's get out of here.

563
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,701
You have no mixers at all and no food.

564
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,414
I love your apartment. It's very manly.

565
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:26,256
It came this way.
I think Norman Mailer shot a deer over there.

566
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,051
I love deer.

567
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,804
Get your tail in here and help me.

568
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,851
She seems to know her way around
in your kitchen.

569
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,231
What's that like?

570
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,398
I told you I don't like giving advice
in these situations.

571
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,949
Why don't you show me around?

572
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,700
I suppose I am a bit curious myself.

573
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,622
Not in there.

574
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,934
What happened to Acapulco?

575
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,194
She does not go to Barnard.

576
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,448
Guys like him like that.

577
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:16,496
-Come on. Let's go in the other room.
-No.

578
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,036
Here.

579
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:38,639
Morning.

580
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,265
Morning.

581
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,435
I'm terribly thirsty.

582
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:45,979
We'll have coffee in a minute.

583
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,277
Just a glass of water, please.

584
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,073
What do I owe you for the evening?

585
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,538
-Don't worry about it.
-I should pay.

586
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,378
The girl, how much was she?

587
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,456
$25.

588
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,421
Fascinating.

589
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,879
Here's $30.

590
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,851
Well, I shall be running along.

591
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:45,202
Thank you for the welcome distraction.

592
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,488
Sorry.

593
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,755
All right. Gentlemen, shall we begin 1965?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
