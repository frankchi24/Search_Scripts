1
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,895
They say as soon as you have
to cut down on your drinking

2
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,143
you have a drinking problem.

3
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,351
My mind is a jumble.

4
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,774
I can't organize my thoughts

5
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,406
and typing feels like work.

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,869
I've never written more than 250 words,

7
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,072
not even in high school.

8
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,577
Five paragraphs, 50 words a piece.

9
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,826
God, I was lazy.

10
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,705
I ShOuld've finished high school.

11
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,382
Everything could have been different.

12
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,356
Are you okay, sir?

13
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,906
Summer's coming.

14
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,663
I smelled it.

15
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,908
I kind of thought I smelled corn,
which is impossible.

16
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,086
There it was again.

17
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,921
Perfume.

18
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,226
Good morning, Miss Blankenship.

19
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,932
How was your surgery?

20
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,517
It was a nightmare.

21
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,150
The ether and the blindness,
and then I got the goggles.

22
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,697
So, everything's good?

23
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:12,117
I'll tell you, I was blind and now I see.

24
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,365
Well, good. If you need more time...

25
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,821
I'm fine, Roger.

26
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,832
I'm kidding around here.

27
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,038
My book's at home.

28
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:24,213
Can you give me the number
for Bethany Van Nuys?

29
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,253
Maybe lift it up and drop it down.

30
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,598
I'm stronger than you,
but I'm not that strong.

31
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,222
Stop. Stop. He's right.

32
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,018
I feel like Margaret Mead.

33
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,688
You know what, Harry?
I think this is a show.

34
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,188
Okay, we're gonna do it.
Harry, get out of the way.

35
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,067
What is going on out here?

36
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,824
I'll be honest, I don't know.

37
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,779
I got blockaded on my way
back from the men's room.

38
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,989
Thank you, gentlemen.

39
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,325
Everyone back to work.

40
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,580
It took my watch.

41
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,785
What?

42
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,963
-Ken was buying a Clark Bar...
-But it ate my change.

43
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,039
And since Danny's not here
we went to Peggy.

44
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,000
But it turns out
Joey's got the smallest hands.

45
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,426
No, I said I had done it before.

46
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,175
Why don't you put another dime
in the machine and pull again?

47
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,301
You really think we didn't try that?

48
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,848
-This thing is a bandit.
-Yeah.

49
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,266
Cut it out!

50
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,934
Don't make me come out here again.

51
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,387
Sorry, Mom.

52
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,104
Pardon?

53
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,144
Okay. Hey, it's over.

54
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,896
I'm trying to get my watch.
What am I supposed to do?

55
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,854
Call the complaint number.
Have an adult solve this problem.

56
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,108
What is going on out here?

57
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,441
I was in the midst
of an extremely important telephone call.

58
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,026
Joan was just handing out demerits.

59
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,695
Joey, in my office.

60
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,614
Go easy on him.

61
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,246
A private spanking, just like my dream.

62
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,498
When did we get a vending machine?

63
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,792
I know you're a freelancer
and you spend time in other offices,

64
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,594
but you should know,
this behavior is not tolerated here.

65
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,761
Yes, ma'am.

66
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,931
I should let you know
there's a problem, now, between us.

67
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,428
Why are you always on my case?

68
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,727
Because you are particularly disrespectful.

69
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,896
No, I'm not. Stan's worse.

70
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,061
Maybe he's better at his job.

71
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,186
I'm glad you're amused.

72
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,112
You're so arrogant.

73
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,610
Me?

74
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,316
What do you do around here
besides walking around

75
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,742
like you're trying to get raped?

76
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,698
Excuse me?

77
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,576
I'm not some young girl off the bus.

78
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,532
I don't need some madam
from a Shanghai whorehouse

79
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,083
to show me the ropes.

80
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,249
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were in here.

81
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,218
Where the hell else would I be?
This is my office.

82
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,216
And you all better stop
cutting through here.

83
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,263
It's not a thoroughfare.

84
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,717
Take the extra steps. You could use them.

85
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,428
You're right.

86
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,599
Go ahead. I'm leaving anyway.

87
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,609
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,075
Oh, no.

89
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,542
Miss Blankenship, good to see you.

90
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,245
I mean, nice to see you.
I mean, welcome back.

91
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,798
-Let me help you with those.
-Finally, someone offers.

92
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,175
I told you I can see with the glasses.

93
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,972
-I'm out of cigarettes.
-I've got your liquor.

94
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,226
I only have two hands.

95
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,644
I'm set.

96
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,847
And then you're not.

97
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,893
Take those back to the storeroom,

98
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,101
and while you're there,
get me some cigarettes.

99
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,776
Your wife called earlier.

100
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,445
She's not my wife.

101
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,899
Mrs. Francis said to remind you
that you can't have the kids this weekend.

102
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,952
It's very complicated.
It's Bobby's birthday party, Sunday.

103
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,574
It's Gene's birthday.

104
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,452
Did you want me to buy him or her a gift?

105
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,663
No.

106
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,056
What a pleasant surprise.

107
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,282
You don't mind that I'm home early, do you?

108
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,208
You said you didn't want to watch me pack.

109
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,786
You don't even want to say goodbye.

110
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,209
I don't.

111
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,633
Jeanie, it's basic training. I'll be back.

112
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,254
You said they use live ammunition.

113
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,591
Come on.

114
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,222
Come in here.

115
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,444
Greg, that doesn't make everything better.
It makes it worse.

116
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,147
It's eight weeks.

117
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,526
I'm gonna come back in uniform.
You Know you'll like that.

118
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,621
What am I gonna do?
Who am I gonna talk to?

119
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,201
Well, you'll talk to your friends at work.

120
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,223
Is this the way you want
to spend this time, crying?

121
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,645
-I can't.
-Sure you can.

122
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,107
Just pretend we're in some midtown hotel

123
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,944
and we both snuck away for the afternoon.

124
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,640
More and more every day about Vietnam.

125
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,098
I hope it's not another Korea.

126
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,690
I sound like a little girl,
writing down what happened today.

127
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,858
Sunday is Gene's birthday party.

128
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,486
I know I can't go.

129
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,243
I keep thinking about him.

130
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,125
He was conceived
in a moment of desperation

131
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,791
and born into a mess.

132
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,763
A list of things i'd like to do.

133
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,023
One,

134
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,067
climb mount Kilimanjaro.

135
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,695
Go anywhere in Africa, actually.

136
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,780
Two,

137
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,155
gain a modicum of control
over the way I feel.

138
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,738
I want to wake up.

139
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,495
I don't wanna be that man.

140
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,666
Could you get that to el jefe?

141
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,924
So, Mountain Dew...

142
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,348
Everything kind of fell apart there.
They don't like the work.

143
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,050
Too bad.

144
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,057
Well, somebody showed
a couple of bottlers the work,

145
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,685
and they don't like witches brewing things.

146
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,731
They don't like the occult in general.

147
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,606
And you told them
it's their hillbilly working a still?

148
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:47,155
I did, but the fact remains
that in the world of sodie pop,

149
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,779
Pepsi is the tail and the bottlers are the dog.

150
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,030
They just want us to change the drawing.

151
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,325
Except it's damaged goods.

152
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,998
They're never gonna want to see
that board again. Start over.

153
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,952
I did it with Joey.
Do you want Stan to take over?

154
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,662
You're spreading me awful thin.

155
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,668
Do you want me to tell Joan to figure it out?

156
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,626
"It"? You don't even know what "it" is.

157
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,837
Miss Blankenship, get Joan in here.

158
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,671
She startles when you do that.

159
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,552
-I had an uncle who was blind.
-She's not blind.

160
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,262
She's recovering from cataract surgery.

161
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,346
He had syphilis.

162
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,798
He would come in the room
and he would say...

163
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,715
What can I do for you?

164
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,766
A redo on Mountain Dew.

165
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,557
I want to make Joey full time
for a couple of weeks.

166
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,232
I'd have to double-check on his availability,

167
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,854
but are you sure he's the right fit?

168
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,819
He did the first round.

169
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,441
And we're redoing it.

170
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,363
It's more complicated than that.

171
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:17,537
Well, this may not be the time or
the place to bring this up, but...

172
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,035
-What now?
-I've been hearing complaints about him.

173
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,286
Really?

174
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,960
He's not a gentleman with the girls.

175
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,959
Okay. One juicy story?

176
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:31,714
I'll protect those concerned,
but it involves an extremely blue joke.

177
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,262
-When?
-It doesn't matter.

178
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,386
Fine, you can tell it to me later.
Boys will be boys.

179
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,309
Of course,
but I'm going to call in other books.

180
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,308
There's too much to do.

181
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,727
I Know the joke.

182
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,230
-This guy's balls are so big...
-Are we done?

183
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,777
Sure.

184
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:59,246
Can you tell Ray Charles
to come in here and clean this up?

185
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,956
And as soon as you get to Hollywood
you find out that that myth is...

186
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,129
Well, it has some truth to it.
There is instant fame.

187
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,627
What's this have to do with Peyton Place?

188
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,254
Well, we went down to the set,

189
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,711
and Ryan was doing this scene
against another rival,

190
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,388
I can't tell you who, and the guy was awful.

191
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,966
And I start to hear him talk
about a young fresh face,

192
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,222
wholesome but a little mischievous.

193
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,599
Am I crazy?

194
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,306
I don't understand. You want to be an actor?

195
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,518
Does that sound like me?
That's you. You could do it.

196
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,852
I know the right people.

197
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,903
Maybe not the big screen,
but the small screen definitely.

198
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,698
I'm kind of down to earth.

199
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:39,653
You're so handsome.
I showed them a picture.

200
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,659
How'd you get a picture?

201
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,992
I sent one of those Polaroids from
the Christmas party to Bernie Kowalski.

202
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,951
Mr Crane, I hate to interrupt you,

203
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,255
but I have Peggy Olson out here
looking for Mr. Baird.

204
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,717
Well, thank you for thinking of me.

205
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,261
You're too modest, you know that?

206
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,800
What were you doing in there?

207
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,306
Every place I've worked there's always
some old fairy who comes on to me,

208
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,853
but that was the weirdest by far.

209
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,680
Yes, everybody wants you, Joey.

210
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,313
-It happens a lot.
-What did you do to Joan?

211
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,517
I told her off.

212
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,104
Well, you shouldn't have.
She's important around here.

213
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,690
Let me tell you something
about the Big Rag...

214
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,902
We're creative,
and she's an overblown secretary.

215
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,531
Fine, don't listen to me.

216
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,579
There's a Joan in every company.

217
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,156
My mother was a Joan.

218
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,333
Always telling everybody what to do.

219
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,911
She even wore a pen around her neck
so people would stare at her tits.

220
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:34,124
She's not your mother,
and she and Lane basically run this place.

221
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,801
Okay, message received.

222
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,505
Is it time to go yet?

223
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,390
Glad you could make it.

224
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,022
Well, we were on our way
to the theater anyway.

225
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:56,071
Ralph Stuben, this is my wife Betty.

226
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,364
-Pleased to meet you.
-I hope you don't mind.

227
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,862
The Congressman wanted
me to do this immediately

228
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,740
and he didn't want me
to do it over the phone.

229
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:06,574
She doesn't mind, and she's very discreet.

230
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,658
That's the curse of a political wife.

231
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,369
That and having to eat dinner
with a lot of people you don't know.

232
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,750
Betty's no stranger to public service.

233
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,956
So, what show did you see?

234
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,088
Why don't we get a drink at the bar?

235
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,134
It'll only be a minute.

236
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,143
Thank you.

237
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,438
So, are you a Felix or an Oscar?

238
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,104
Like most men, I'd rather be an Oscar,
but I'm probably a Felix.

239
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,193
Every date feels like a first date with you.

240
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,244
Is that good or bad?

241
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,788
It's just I know you must
be seeing someone else.

242
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,868
And don't say no,
because it'll just hurt me more.

243
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,541
Look, I'm here with you right now.

244
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,835
We're on a date,

245
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,421
and I thought we were
getting to know each other.

246
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,552
It doesn't just accumulate.
It takes intense, prolonged contact.

247
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,392
Don't you want to be close with anyone?

248
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,346
I do.

249
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,774
I know we're from different generations,

250
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,649
but I'm going to need more from you.

251
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,730
We are from different generations,

252
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,987
because I don't remember
women pushing this hard.

253
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,909
And I'm not seeing anyone.

254
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,862
I'm working.

255
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,413
All the time.

256
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:34,127
Well, I get excited when you call,
and then I don't hear from you.

257
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:37,422
We don't have to get married
for me to show you off at the Country Club.

258
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,378
Don.

259
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,210
How are you?

260
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,053
I'm fine, Henry.

261
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,591
Henry, Betty, this is Miss Van Nuys.

262
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,926
Bethany.

263
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,433
Enjoy your dinner.

264
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,312
My goodness, what was that?

265
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:06,322
Well, that was actually my ex-wife
and her husband,

266
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,155
and some slob who's about to have
the worst dinner of his life.

267
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,240
What? Her?

268
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,219
Well, first of all,
my official capacity, if anyone asks,

269
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,345
I'm here to thank you for securing
the Governor's endorsement

270
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,426
for Congressman Lindsay.

271
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,679
That's no small feat, I'm sure.

272
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,106
Well, Rocky only hates him
because he's handsome.

273
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,687
Well, not to worry.

274
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,235
Lindsay just wants to be Mayor.

275
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,563
Any talk of the White House is fiction.

276
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,404
I guess he hasn't seen the cover of Life.

277
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,743
Okay.

278
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,239
Hypothetically,

279
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,917
the Congressman is putting together
a team with his eye on '72,

280
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,293
and, well, it would be built,

281
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:03,466
if it were going to be built, around you.

282
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,509
And yes, he doesn't want
Rocky to have you either.

283
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,428
Elizabeth, do you know what you want?

284
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,513
Honey, this part is almost over.

285
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,811
I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.

286
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,365
One drink and she gets flushed.

287
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,743
Yeah, my wife has the other problem.

288
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,538
-Are you okay in there, ma'am?
-Yes, I'm fine.

289
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,586
-You dropped your purse.
-I'll take it.

290
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,201
What did you want me to do,
put you in a cab?

291
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,278
That wouldn't be right.

292
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,330
I can't believe you made me
sit there and look at them.

293
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,282
Nobody said you had to look at them.

294
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,245
You need a drink?
Well, what are you, a wino?

295
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:25,002
You need a drink?
That is not something you're allowed to say.

296
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,755
Now you decide what I can and can't say?

297
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,961
I was in a marriage like that before.

298
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,968
You're gonna run into him. it's a small town.

299
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,846
-I hate him.
-Hate's a strong word, Betty.

300
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,848
I hate Nazis.

301
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,021
I have an ex-wife. She bothers me.

302
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,224
I don't like seeing her. I don't hate her.

303
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,400
-You're a saint.
-I'm an adult.

304
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:47,228
It was upsetting. Can't you let me have that?

305
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,985
Not when it ruins the whole evening.

306
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,738
This man is asking me
to take Lindsay all the way.

307
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,491
That could happen.
Don Draper doesn't have a say.

308
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,450
-You're right. Who cares about him?
-You do.

309
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,252
He's taking up too much space in your life,

310
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,749
maybe in your heart.

311
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,672
That's ridiculous.

312
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,551
Look,

313
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,970
maybe we rushed into this.

314
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,467
"We"??

315
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,346
I was six months pregnant when we met.

316
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,095
-Pull over.
-Are you kidding me?

317
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,851
Let me out, Henry.

318
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,729
No, you know what? Let me out at the house

319
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,231
because you don't want
to live there anyway.

320
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,190
You can stay in a hotel
or wherever you were when I met you.

321
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,401
In your mansion with your servants.

322
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,495
Shut up, Betty. You're drunk.

323
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,266
What are you doing?

324
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,268
Making you comfortable.

325
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,864
She's a sweet girl

326
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,955
and she wants me to know hen

327
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,832
but I already do.

328
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,920
People tell you who they are,
but we ignore it

329
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,219
because we want them to be
who we want them to be.

330
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,178
To be continued.

331
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,353
I bet she was thinking of that line all night.

332
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,734
I looked up at the Barbizon
and I thought of all the women in there.

333
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,202
One in every room.

334
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,072
Touching themselves to sleep.

335
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,619
Waverly and 6th.

336
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,082
I like sleeping alone,

337
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,922
stretching out like a skydiver,

338
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,633
cool patches to roll onto.

339
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,849
I should appreciate it more.

340
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,356
No. No! I'm talking now!

341
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,144
I don't care where you go
and I don't care what you do!

342
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,229
So, in order...

343
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,695
Would you let me talk? I want my key back.

344
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,577
And I don't want to see
your shorts on my floor,

345
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,121
and I don't want you complaining
that I don't cook 'cause I don't cook!

346
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,501
You know what, David?
Go shit in the ocean!

347
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,454
Good morning.

348
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,460
Are you leaving already?

349
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,967
Were you going to say goodbye?

350
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,478
I thought you could use the sleep.

351
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,891
I'm sorry, Henry.

352
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,111
Come over here.

353
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,160
I don't want to have
to defend myself all the time.

354
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,291
All the time?

355
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,507
Henry, I'm really sorry.

356
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,925
I know.

357
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,341
Get some sleep.

358
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,096
Carla took the kids to school.

359
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,685
Henry, he was the only man
I'd ever been with.

360
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,523
I'll call you later.

361
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,578
It tastes good

362
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,951
because it still basically
tastes like Mountain Dew.

363
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,079
And it's very simple to make. I call it jet fuel.

364
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,410
Rocket fuel.

365
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,336
And I like the simplicity of the idea.

366
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,586
-Young people, hillbillies.
-Xerox crapped out again.

367
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,417
I think I killed it.

368
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,005
I'll run this specimen over to the lab.

369
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:07,510
It's delicious.

370
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,553
You're a haircut, you know that?

371
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,730
You need three ingredients for a cocktail.

372
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,149
Vodka and Mountain Dew is an emergency.

373
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,358
Don wants our
freelance art director Joey Baird

374
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,159
put on full time for the next three weeks.

375
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,453
None of my business, I suppose.

376
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,418
I really think this vending machine
is a troublemaker.

377
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,498
I think it's been a great success.

378
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,926
Revenue is climbing.

379
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:47,005
I was gonna suggest
we get a sandwich machine.

380
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,057
We'd probably get 40% of the work force
keeping busy through lunch.

381
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,351
Or we'd end up with
a bunch of fat secretaries

382
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,894
who think the whole afternoon is lunchtime

383
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,939
because there's always another
sandwich around the corner.

384
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,358
There have been a lot of complaints.

385
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,986
Did you tell them to call the number?

386
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,693
What do you think they're doing in there,
Lane and Joan?

387
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,619
It's an unholy alliance.

388
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,743
I know exactly what they're doing in there.

389
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,292
Joan's on the desk, boobs on the blotter.

390
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,540
Lane's behind her.

391
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,714
Probably has a bowler hat. Am I wrong?

392
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,507
Hey, don't do that.

393
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,335
I'm not doing anything. Joan's doing it.

394
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,048
Mountain Dew-dah.

395
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,260
Give me three cocktails
with at least three ingredients each.

396
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:39,440
Peggy Olson,
pioneering the science of wet blanketry.

397
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,358
You love her.

398
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,864
Henry Francis calling.

399
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,790
This is Don.

400
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,624
Hello, Don. Henry Francis.
Sorry to bother you at work.

401
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,674
I assume it's important.

402
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,673
It is, but not dire.

403
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,888
Okay.

404
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,261
What can I do for you?

405
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,810
I bought a boat and I...

406
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,307
Well, I'd like to put it in the garage,

407
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,481
and I don't have the clearance
with your things there.

408
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,892
No, of course.

409
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,479
I can probably have some movers take them,
put them in storage somewhere.

410
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,109
I can take it off the rent.

411
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,065
No. No, that's okay.

412
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,992
I should probably come
and get them myself.

413
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,330
Gene's birthday party is on Sunday.

414
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,741
I know.

415
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,247
So, I think Saturday would be best,
don't you?

416
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,586
I see.

417
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,588
The boat's coming next week so...

418
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,010
Fine.

419
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,758
I'll come at noon.

420
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,100
Miss Blankenship, can I get some coffee?

421
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,445
I just lost 30 cents in the machine.

422
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,991
How is that possible?

423
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,787
Well, I wanted a pack of Life Savers,
so I put in a nickel and it didn't work.

424
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,990
So, I looked in my purse
and all I had was a quarter,

425
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,289
so then I lost a quarter too.

426
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,542
Was the exact-change light on?

427
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,620
I started with the exact change.

428
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,081
Peggy, it's a nickel.

429
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,046
I'm not calling that number.
No one ever answers.

430
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,877
I can't believe you.

431
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,463
Fine, then give me some Life Savers.

432
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,774
Who did that?

433
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:51,898
Did what?

434
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,029
That pornographic drawing.

435
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,785
It's a very brave person
that does something anonymously.

436
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,740
It's a very brave person who does that.

437
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,702
It's still illegal in many states, you know.

438
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,921
I can't wait until next year
when all of you are in Vietnam.

439
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,596
You will be pining for the day

440
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,845
when someone was trying
to make your life easier.

441
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:20,933
And when you're over there,

442
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,227
when you're in the jungle,
and they're shooting at you,

443
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,855
remember you're not dying for me
because I never liked you.

444
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,742
-Joan.
-Don't worry. I'm not going home.

445
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,371
Jesus. Scorched earth.

446
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,619
-What's wrong with her?
-I told you not to do that.

447
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,872
-Come on, Peggy.
-It's a joke.

448
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,753
She's still patting around for the buzzer.
I'm sorry.

449
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,130
What do you want?

450
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,090
Joey taped it to Joan's window.

451
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:01,933
-Really?
-Yes,

452
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,559
and it's disrespectful to Joan
and it's disrespectful to me.

453
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,315
Narrative, forced perspective...
Are you sure Joey did this?

454
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,893
Yes, I told him not to.

455
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,149
Well, I wouldn't tolerate that if I were you.

456
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,151
But you have no problem with it?

457
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,779
I didn't say that.

458
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,576
Look, Peggy, just go fire him.

459
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,362
Me?

460
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,369
I thought you would go out there
and yell at him.

461
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:25,700
Yell at him, fire him.

462
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,001
Look, believe me,
you do not want me involved in this.

463
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,669
People will think you're a tattletale.

464
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,581
Dr. Miller has arrived.

465
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,587
Send her in.

466
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:39,096
You want some respect?
Go out there and get it for yourself.

467
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,015
I'm sorry.

468
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,262
Have a seat.

469
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,063
Is everything all right?

470
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,725
Yes.

471
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,030
Joey, can I speak to you for a minute?

472
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,778
-You want one?
-No.

473
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,374
I'm sorry, okay?

474
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,206
Good. Now, go apologize.

475
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,882
What? Then she'll know I did it.

476
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,085
You did do it. I told you not to.

477
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,216
Come on. It's funny.

478
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,717
Really? Would you show it to Lane?

479
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,140
He would think it's funny.

480
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,054
What if it were Don on his knees?

481
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,015
See? This is why
I don't like working with women.

482
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,846
You have no sense of humor.

483
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,891
You're fired.

484
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,106
All right, all right.
I see the nostrils are flared.

485
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,437
-I'll go apologize.
-No.

486
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,147
Get your things.

487
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,153
-Are you serious?
-I am.

488
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,402
We'll see what Don has to say about that.

489
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,579
Don doesn't even know who you are.

490
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,287
-I'm sorry it didn't work out.
-Hang on. Come on.

491
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,869
This is crazy.

492
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,122
It's just a job, Joey. You'll get another one.

493
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,923
Well, I was wrong about you.

494
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,441
What's going on?

495
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,523
Watch out, fellas. Fun's over.

496
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,450
-What?
-That's all, folks.

497
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,450
-Are you serious?
-A little bug bit me.

498
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,624
Well, I'll give you a call. We'll have a drink.

499
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,128
Stan, throw Vick Chemical
on the back burner.

500
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,297
You're on Mountain Dew.

501
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:42,135
Power of the poontang.

502
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,087
You know, these guys may be embarrassed

503
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,549
by having some professional
tell them what to do.

504
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,633
He'll take advice from another man.

505
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,685
Not if he knows more.

506
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,936
You know I'm right about auto parts.
I used to sell cars.

507
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,689
Yes, but we still have to do it.

508
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,903
God, this is boring.

509
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,490
I think I'm hungry. Do you want to eat?

510
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,327
You mean order in?

511
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:10,246
I don't know. You seem kind of dressed up.

512
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,746
We could take Fillmore Parts
with us if you want.

513
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,583
Just to clarify...

514
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,668
You'd like to have dinner with me?

515
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,218
Yes.

516
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,262
You asked me out
the first time I came in here.

517
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,935
Why would it be different for me now?

518
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,806
It just felt like the timing is right-

519
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,769
So, why don't we do that?

520
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,571
You could ask me out for dinner
at some future date,

521
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:44,990
instead of, I don't know,

522
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,239
tacking it on to a workday
like an afterthought.

523
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,196
I could do that.

524
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:55,333
Saturday night far enough in the future?

525
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,457
Not normally, but you're in luck.

526
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,622
Good.

527
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,258
Okay then.

528
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,294
I've got enough to go on here.

529
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,846
Okay.

530
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,219
-Good night.
-Good night.

531
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,606
-it's Francine.
-Come in.

532
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,153
I'm all bitten up.

533
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,823
This is my potato salad bowl,
but this one's yours.

534
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,950
Well, thank you.

535
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,823
Henry was going to pick one up
on his way home from work,

536
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,575
but he's been so busy.

537
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:35,248
Betty, he's very ambitious.

538
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,834
He's mad at me.

539
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,707
Why would that be so?

540
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,174
Oh, God, if I can make it
through this weekend...

541
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,422
It's a two-year-old's birthday party,

542
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,471
and you'll have help, and no one cares.

543
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,385
Is he coming?

544
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,560
I told him about it.

545
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,607
Now I can only hope
he won't show up and ruin it.

546
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,230
Well, he won't.

547
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,938
We ran into him in the city...

548
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,364
On a date.

549
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,693
Bethany Van Nuys. She was all of 15.

550
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,321
I misbehaved.

551
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,953
Henry didn't understand it for some reason.

552
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:20,252
Why do you let him bother you?

553
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,750
We see him walking out
with the kids some weekends.

554
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,502
Carlton calls him "that sad bastard."

555
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,128
That's an act.

556
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,419
He's living the life, let me tell you.

557
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,381
He doesn't get to have this family and that.

558
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,474
Betty.

559
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,014
You have terrible luck with entertaining.

560
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,187
Just be careful.

561
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:50,778
Don has nothing to lose,
and you have everything.

562
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,010
I don't know if you heard, but I tired Joey.

563
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,180
I did. Good for you.

564
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,642
Excuse me?

565
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,104
Now everybody in the office will know
that you solved my problem

566
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,398
and that you must be really important,
I guess.

567
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,935
What's wrong with you?

568
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,520
I defended you.

569
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,480
You defended yourself.

570
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,273
Fine.

571
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,656
That cartoon was disgusting.

572
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,703
I had already handled it

573
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,531
and if I had wanted to go further,

574
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,992
one dinner with Mr. Kreutzer
from Sugarberry Ham

575
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:45,204
and Joey would've been off it
and out of my hair.

576
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,288
So? It's the same result.

577
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,291
You want to be a big shot.

578
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,424
Well, no matter how powerful
we get around here,

579
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,676
they can still just draw a cartoon.

580
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,559
So, all you've done is prove to them
that I'm a meaningless secretary

581
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,477
and you're another humorless bitch.

582
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,109
Have a nice weekend. Good night, Peggy.

583
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,870
When a man walks into a room,

584
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,414
he brings his Whole life with him.

585
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,211
He has a million reasons
for being anywhere.

586
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,921
Just ask him.

587
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,596
If you listen, he'll tell you how he got there,

588
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,360
how he forgot where he was going

589
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,729
and then he woke up.

590
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:59,570
If you listen, he'll tell you about
the time he thought he was an angel

591
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,073
or dreamt of being perfect.

592
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,537
And then he'll smile with wisdom,

593
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,874
content that he'd realized
the world isn't perfect.

594
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:19,302
We're Hawed
because we want so much more.

595
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,532
We 're ruined

596
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,735
because we get these things

597
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,786
and wish for what we had.

598
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,167
You smell nice.

599
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,969
So do you.

600
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,046
Like chlorine.

601
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:03,266
I've been swimming.

602
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,638
Does it feel like summer?

603
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,978
It clears my head.

604
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,353
-For the creative process?
-For something.

605
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,235
I've been a little out of sorts lately.

606
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,615
And it's an effort to get in the water,

607
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,411
but when you do you're weightless
and you don't even sweat.

608
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,495
And in the end,

609
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,282
you're wrung out.

610
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,916
I've been looking forward to this.

611
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,297
It's very hard to get a reservation here.

612
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,792
You should've called me.

613
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:39,886
I know a guy.

614
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,008
Really?

615
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,890
Who's your guy?

616
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,264
My father.

617
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,598
A lot of people who supply restaurants

618
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,682
know a lot of the same people
who know my father.

619
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,315
Like?

620
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,065
Not my father, just his friends.

621
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,488
He owns a candy store,

622
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:07,493
and there are certain responsibilities
that go along with that.

623
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,829
Interesting.

624
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,829
What's he like?

625
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,712
He's a handsome, two-bit gangster like you.

626
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,049
Two glasses of Chianti.

627
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,680
When I'm out of sorts, I look at the calendar.

628
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:35,521
There's usually something significant
on the horizon.

629
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,361
I never noticed that.

630
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,827
It's my two-year-old's birthday,

631
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,780
but I'm not going.

632
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,245
Why not?

633
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,413
Because I'm not welcome there.

634
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,383
He thinks that man's his father.

635
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,384
Maybe that's okay.

636
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,555
All he knows of the world
is what you show him.

637
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,735
That's nice.

638
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,417
I know I've sometimes
behaved to the contrary,

639
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,373
but I do admire your work.

640
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,546
That's nice to hear.

641
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,213
So, tell me a trade secret.

642
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,930
How do you get them to do
what you want them to do?

643
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,439
Aesop has a fable about
the wind and the sun.

644
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,352
The wind and sun had this competition

645
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:03,484
to see if they could get a traveler's coat off.

646
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,778
So, the wind blows fiercely on him,

647
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,285
but the traveler just pulls his coat tighter-

648
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,831
But the sun shines down on him,
warmer and warmer,

649
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,369
and the traveler just takes it off.

650
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,872
And the moral is?

651
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:27,554
Kindness, gentleness and persuasion
win where force fails.

652
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,052
You know, Aesop did that
in probably 10 lines.

653
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,432
He's very economical.

654
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,057
So, what you're saying is you want my coat.

655
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,411
72nd and Broadway.

656
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,167
Thank you.

657
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,615
Where do you live?

658
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,071
Only around the corner.

659
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,035
Really?

660
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,288
Yes.

661
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,917
But I'm just going to take you to your door.

662
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,468
And why is that?

663
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,511
Because that's as far as I can go right now

664
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,807
and I'm not ready to say good night.

665
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:02,394
That's not what I expected.

666
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,096
-Hello, Francine.
-Hello, Don.

667
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:20,347
Daddy!

668
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,975
What's he doing here?

669
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,401
It's okay.

670
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,247
Here you go. Say hi to Daddy.

671
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,869
Happy Birthday.

672
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,665
We have everything.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
