<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

2
00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:05,471
You stay away from her!
You hear me?

3
00:00:05,784 --> 00:00:07,720
Don, are you ever gonna call back
the American Cancer Society?

4
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:09,609
They've tried you
twice this morning.

5
00:00:10,816 --> 00:00:12,624
I'm not gonna run out of
here crying tomorrow.

6
00:00:18,903 --> 00:00:19,711
She's gone.

7
00:00:20,904 --> 00:00:21,727
I know.

8
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,391
I think it's time
for us to move.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,304
Meet me for dinner, in the open,
wherever I want, because...

10
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:30,247
We can do that now.

12
00:01:13,713 --> 00:01:14,779
Hello?

13
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:21,152
I still have to pack
for a 7:00 A.M. Flight

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,854
Thanks to you.

15
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,295
Will you at least put me out
of my misery before you go?

16
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:33,298
Stop it.
American cancer loved the letter

17
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,033
And they're gonna love you.

18
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:38,269
And then you're
gonna stop working,

19
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:41,239
Take your kids to
California and have a ball.

20
00:01:42,908 --> 00:01:45,443
I have this sick feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

21
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:54,152
Listen, maybe it's
not all about work.

22
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:59,591
Maybe that sick feeling
might go away

23
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:01,393
If you take your head
out of the sand about

24
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:04,462
The past.

25
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:07,265
You know it's not that simple.

26
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:09,134
Of course it isn't,

27
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:11,636
And you don't have
to do it alone.

28
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,839
But if you resolve
some of that,

29
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:17,409
You might be more comfortable
with everything.

30
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:20,045
And then what happens?

31
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:23,748
And then you're stuck trying to
be a person like the rest of us.

32
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:40,065
I'll call you Tuesday
when you get back.

33
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,740
I'm gonna miss you, you know.

34
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:15,300
- Any outgoing?
- Just... This.

35
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:18,069
Don't post it.
It's for you.

36
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:20,505
It's been discussed
among the partners

37
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:22,107
That you be promoted

38
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,642
To director
of agency operations.

39
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:27,445
My goodness.

40
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:29,914
<i>Now it's a dreadful reality</i>

41
00:03:29,982 --> 00:03:33,184
That we've not signed
any new business in 10 weeks,

42
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:35,620
<i>So I hope you'll understand</i>

43
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:39,958
That this is
a title only... For now.

44
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,994
Well, it's almost an honor.

45
00:03:49,435 --> 00:03:52,403
What made you
suddenly write that?

46
00:03:56,809 --> 00:04:00,445
Well, most of it was
in the letter, hopefully.

47
00:04:01,981 --> 00:04:05,817
But I think in my heart
it was an impulse,

48
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:08,353
Because I knew what I needed
to do to move forward.

49
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,589
Well, it was a gesture
we hope will be useful.

50
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:14,659
We believe, obviously, that
lung cancer is avoidable

51
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:17,529
And can be thwarted
with the right campaign.

52
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:21,566
- But how? - We know frightening
medical facts are useless.

53
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:25,103
- Half of us are smokers.
- I'smoker too.

54
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:28,606
And you can forget about us.
I've worked $10 million campaigns

55
00:04:28,674 --> 00:04:30,508
That can't even get
people to change brands.

56
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:32,310
I can tell you from the inside

57
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:35,046
That the business is really
only about getting new smokers.

58
00:04:35,114 --> 00:04:36,948
Teenagers are a tough sell.

59
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:39,517
Not to tobacco companies.

60
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,386
They play
on a two-pronged attack,

61
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:43,621
Promising adulthood
and rebellion.

62
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:47,492
But teenagers are
sentimental as well.

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,327
Have you heard their music?

64
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:54,165
I can tell you a little
of what I have in mind.

65
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,868
I have to say
it's very interesting.

66
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:58,670
Go on.

67
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:05,243
What I'm suggesting
is a series of commercials

68
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:06,978
That run during
"bandstand" and the like.

69
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:10,448
Show mothers and daughters
or fathers and sons

70
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:13,585
And that cigarettes
are between them.

71
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:17,422
And you show
with a walk on the beach,

72
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:19,857
Baking cookies, playing catch,

73
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:22,860
That the parents are
not long for this world.

74
00:05:22,928 --> 00:05:24,562
But they hate their parents.

75
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,731
They won't be thinking
about their parents.

76
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,366
They'll be thinking
about themselves.

77
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:30,301
That's what they do.

78
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,371
The truth is

79
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:36,541
They're mourning
for their childhood

80
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:39,844
More than they're
anticipating their future,

81
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:42,080
Because they don't know it yet
but they don't want to die.

82
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:48,620
If it helps, I can guarantee you
that lucky strike will hate this.

83
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,428
- How'd it go?
- So did you get cancer?

84
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:01,032
Megan, can you get
Mr. Cosgrove?

85
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:04,235
We've got a meeting
for another meeting.

86
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:05,937
They were eating
out of his hand.

87
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,509
And even better,
the board was loaded

88
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:13,778
With fat cats
just like you said.

89
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,781
Don had a particularly
empathic exchange

90
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:18,383
With the c.E.O.
Of Dow chemical.

91
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,618
Saran wrap would be nice.

92
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:22,553
I'll take him out on the
links, let him beat me.

93
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:25,156
Roger, this is a
philanthropic organization.

94
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:26,958
Don and I think it best if
we approach from the rear.

95
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,529
- Are we celebrating?
- Don got us to the top three.

96
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:33,765
- Stupendous.
- Ken, sit down.

97
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:44,075
Everett Marlowe at Dow is
a very charming fellow.

98
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:48,846
Your father-in-law to be
is at corning, rht?

99
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:50,281
Well, they must be
quite acquainted.

100
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,184
I think that's likely.

101
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:55,019
Well, I was thinking

102
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:57,121
Wouldn't it be fun to have
a foursome this weekend

103
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,657
That includes your father-in-law,
yourself and Mr. Marlowe?

104
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:01,626
Doesn't that sound like fun?

105
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:08,166
I don't know.

106
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:10,401
Ken, there's no reason
to be suddenly shy.

107
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:12,970
I'm sure if you impressed
Everett this morning

108
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,173
That should be enough
to get him on the phone.

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,974
Well, I just looked him in
the eye and convinced him

110
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:19,444
I was some kind of
idealistic businessman.

111
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:21,312
How is it gonna look
if I call for a meeting?

112
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,448
Pretty bad, I guess.

113
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:27,352
But I'm not Pete.

114
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:30,488
- Sorry about that.
- No, you're obviously not.

115
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:34,025
Tom Vogel is our biggest client

116
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:36,394
Unless we sign Dow,
which would be yours.

117
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:38,863
Look, I love Cynthia's dad

118
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:41,332
And I know that every account I
have will eventually leave me.

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,867
That's awfully pessimistic.

120
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:44,635
Well, it's not worth the risk.

121
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:47,338
<i>Cynthia's my life...
my actual life.</i>

122
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:52,076
Fine, if you want to tuck it
between your legs, I'll call him,

123
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:53,978
But I have to warn you,
I'm going to drop your name.

124
00:07:55,447 --> 00:07:57,181
You do whatever you want.

125
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:59,984
Now if you don't mind,
I'm going to go service

126
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:02,854
The 30% of this firm
that are my clients.

127
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:14,532
Hello, Carla.
Is Sally home?

128
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,136
She is,
but you shouldn't be here.

129
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:19,837
Are they moving today?

130
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:23,307
Monday.
That's the salvation army.

131
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,110
Mrs. Draper's car is gone.
I just wanted to say hi.

132
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:27,912
I don't know.

133
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,114
Fine. I just want
to say bye.

134
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,285
She's upstairs.

135
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:36,754
Don't be long. Mrs.
Francis just ran to the store.

136
00:08:36,822 --> 00:08:39,023
Thank you.

137
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:42,627
<i>It's Glen.
Are you decent?</i>

138
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:44,429
Come in.

139
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,568
You really shouldn't be here.

140
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:54,605
So you're finally moving.

141
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:58,142
This weekend while we're
in California with my dad.

142
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,711
Jeez, is that
where you're moving?

143
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,213
No, we're moving to rye.

144
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:07,552
I'll be able to drive
in a few years.

145
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:09,821
- I can come visit.
- Really?

146
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:11,522
Absolutely.

147
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:16,060
I can send you postcards.

148
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:17,929
I have your address.

149
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:20,264
It's not at big a deal.

150
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:22,400
I say goodbye
to people all the time.

151
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:33,811
Okay. Are you going
to Disneyland?

152
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,614
- Yes.
- Get me something.

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,828
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

154
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:53,097
- It's my fault.
- Get out.

155
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:57,034
- What are you waiting for?
- Why do you hate me?

156
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:58,870
You don't think
I know what you're doing?

157
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:01,873
<i>- You could be friends with anyone!
- Just 'cause you're sad</i>

158
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,040
Doesn't mean
everybody has to be.

159
00:10:06,678 --> 00:10:08,579
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

160
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:11,249
I didn't see the harm.
He wanted to say goodbye.

161
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:14,685
- Did you leave them alone?
- They're friends, that's all.

162
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:16,654
When did you decide
that you're her mother?

163
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,657
It was a mistake.

164
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:21,692
There's no need
for that kind of talk.

165
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:24,762
You know what, Carla?

166
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:27,632
I've been thinking

167
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:29,667
And the distance is...

168
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:31,836
I need someone new nearby,

169
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:34,138
Someone closer
to the new house.

170
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:36,274
This should square us
for the week.

171
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,545
Do you think
I enjoy doing this?

172
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:43,481
After all these years?
I won't have it, Carla.

173
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,886
Well, someone has to
look after those children.

174
00:10:48,954 --> 00:10:51,656
Really? And where
are your kids?

175
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:54,592
- Are they all doctors and lawyers?
- You'd best stop talking now.

176
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,863
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to say goodbye to the children.

177
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:00,665
Do you think that's
a good idea right now?

178
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:02,567
It'll just upset them more.

179
00:11:02,634 --> 00:11:04,502
Some other time.

180
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:14,412
The bungalow in San Pedro

181
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,480
Netted you 10 grand in profit.

182
00:11:16,548 --> 00:11:18,482
What's happening
with the other house?

183
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,886
I have a listing appointment with the
Realtor when I get back from California,

184
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:23,888
- But I have no idea what it's worth.
- It's ossining,

185
00:11:23,956 --> 00:11:25,590
But I say you'll more
than double your money,

186
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:28,159
Which is not bad for 10 years.

187
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:30,528
What about the loss for what
I put into the company?

188
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:32,563
That's an investment.
It's not a loss.

189
00:11:32,631 --> 00:11:34,298
Don't be impatient.

190
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:37,368
Enjoy the harvest.
Plant some seeds.

191
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:39,637
Maybe get a place of your own.

192
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:42,740
Don't you want to go home someday
and see a steak on the table?

193
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:47,311
So, Mary sunshine,

194
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,580
What's the capital gains? 48%?

195
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:52,183
<i>Mrs.
Francis is on the phone.</i>

196
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,851
<i>- It's urgent.
- You want me to go?</i>

197
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,486
It's always urgent.

198
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:58,990
<i>- Hello?
- I'm very sorry,</i>

199
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:00,691
And I know this will
disrupt your plans,

200
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,360
But I'm afraid I had
to let Carla go today.

201
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:04,328
What? What happened?

202
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,731
Don, I have the children
99% of the time.

203
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:08,265
This is a decision
that I get to make.

204
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,334
Well, can't I just hire
her back for the trip?

205
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:13,337
<i>No. I don't want her
poisoning the well.</i>

206
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:15,272
I told the kids she's sick.

207
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,441
So what the hell do I do,
Betty, with no help?

208
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:21,145
I have meetings, two flights,
diapers, for Christ's sake.

209
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:24,248
Then don't take them!
They're used to it.

210
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:26,117
<i>We're going.</i>

211
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,201
Hey, pumpernickel,
there's nobody out front.

212
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:46,270
- I already ate.
- Me too,

213
00:12:46,338 --> 00:12:48,439
And I ran into someone
I'd like you to meet.

214
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:50,908
This is Carolyn Jones,
like Morticia;

215
00:12:50,976 --> 00:12:53,544
<i>Peggy Olson,
advertising Wunderkind.</i>

216
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:55,813
- Pleased to meet you.
- Do you mind?

217
00:12:58,016 --> 00:12:59,450
Carolyn was at a photo shoot

218
00:12:59,518 --> 00:13:01,752
Modeling pantyhose
of all things.

219
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,388
She got fired and she
has to make rent.

220
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:08,259
Joyce witnessed my nervous breakdown
at Howard Johnson's today.

221
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,329
Well hello, ladies.

222
00:13:12,397 --> 00:13:14,965
Peggy, I needed to talk to
you about my ABC meeting,

223
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,567
But if I'm interrupting...

224
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:19,036
Who is this lovely young thing?

225
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:21,572
Harry, this is my friend Joyce.
I thought you'd already met.

226
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,442
Harold crane, head of media.

227
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:27,044
- Carolyn Jones.
- No kidding.

228
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:29,246
She's looking for work.

229
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:31,115
That's hard to believe.

230
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:35,586
As an actress, model?
What is your experience like?

231
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:39,023
Well, I've been modeling,
at least until this morning.

232
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:42,126
The topaz people went nuts,
fired the people who hired me

233
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:44,061
- And then me. - But you didn't
do anything wrong, did you?

234
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,863
No, she didn't.

235
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:47,531
Peggy, do you think
you can help?

236
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,200
Maybe.

237
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,669
I'm sorry. You said
topaz fired everyone?

238
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:54,638
- They were very brusque.
- People lose their heads.

239
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:56,974
I'm sure it was
a mistake, dear.

240
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:58,943
We should be going, honey.

241
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,212
Yes. Yes, of course.

242
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,114
Pleased to meet you.

243
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,982
We'll see what
we can do, Carolyn Jones.

244
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:23,063
<i>Any luck?</i>

245
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,931
The hotel has a service,

246
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,067
But the girls who can take
care of Sally and Bobby

247
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,768
Won't watch a two-year-old
and vice versa.

248
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:31,204
So I've arranged for two girls

249
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:32,906
To cover the two
mornings you're working.

250
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,041
I thought you might need
someone for Disneyland

251
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:38,178
And maybe handle the
dodger game on your own.

252
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:41,181
- Does that sound like a vacation?
- Maybe it'll be an adventure.

253
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,720
How much do you make a week?

254
00:14:47,788 --> 00:14:50,557
- $70.
- What if I were to double that?

255
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:54,194
I'll give you some nights free and
you'll get to go to California...

256
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,029
Swimming pools, movie stars.

257
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:58,731
I don't really have
any professional experience.

258
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,067
You'll be great.
Sally loved you,

259
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:02,469
Bobby likes a pretty face

260
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:05,171
And the baby...
he's tough but he's fun.

261
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,441
I've never been to California.

262
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:11,211
I have a college friend who's
been begging me to visit.

263
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,780
Perfect. Call her up,
pick a night,

264
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:16,716
I'll foot the bill.
What do you have to lose?

265
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,953
Please stop the advertising.

266
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,060
<i>Come on.
Let's go to the room first.</i>

267
00:15:27,128 --> 00:15:29,095
Let's go or we're gonna go
back to the parking lot

268
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:30,563
And spend the weekend
locked in the car.

269
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:43,209
Art Garten... real name... at
topaz pantyhose called me back.

270
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,812
He was shocked and impressed that
I'd heard about them firing Dupre.

271
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,780
It gets better.
They already bought placement

272
00:15:47,848 --> 00:15:49,482
For the campaign
that just fell apart,

273
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,851
And we've been invited in
Monday to pick up the pieces.

274
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:54,454
- I just told you that.
- Monday's a holiday.

275
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:57,590
They're out of time. All we have to
do is not throw up on our shoes.

276
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:59,726
- Do you want help?
- He's not gonna be there.

277
00:16:03,097 --> 00:16:04,564
Good work.

278
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:11,137
Okay okay, here he is.

279
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,189
That was great.

280
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,157
It's how we got gene to sleep.

281
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:32,625
Well, let's not wake him up.

282
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:38,264
They played in the pool
for four hours

283
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:41,067
And bounced on the bed
for another two.

284
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:43,903
I think everybody's
gonna sleep very well.

285
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,472
I need you to come over at
7:00 tomorrow to watch gene.

286
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,174
I'll get these two
breakfast on the road.

287
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,877
<i>Okay.
Bonne nuit, Les animaux.</i>

288
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:52,679
- Good night.
- Good night.

289
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:56,115
You said you didn't have any experience
and you're like Maria Von Trapp.

290
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,917
Professionally,

291
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,887
But I have four nieces
and six nephews.

292
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,536
So how was your meeting?

293
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:19,739
Pick me up and move me to my bed.

294
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,012
Well, hello there.

295
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,451
Stephanie, this is
Sally and Bobby.

296
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:33,186
- Hello.
- Hi.

297
00:17:33,254 --> 00:17:35,488
Well, it's very nice
to meet you.

298
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,124
How do you like California?

299
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,628
They love it.

300
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:44,631
The notary is supposed to be
here at 10:00, but she's late.

301
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:48,501
My mom put the papers in order
so all you have to do is sign

302
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,403
<i>And then you can go
to Marineland.</i>

303
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,239
Who painted on the wall?

304
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:57,410
My friend Anna.
She used to live here.

305
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:58,978
Stephanie is her niece.

306
00:18:00,314 --> 00:18:01,881
Who's Dick?

307
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,820
Well...

308
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:11,157
That's me.

309
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:15,762
That's my nickname sometimes.

310
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,836
Go out back and get us
some lemons.

311
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,109
<i>They're adorable.</i>

312
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,748
- Is this it?
- My friend Charlie is gonna

313
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:37,717
Help me move the piano
back to my mom's,

314
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:41,788
And the rest of it goes
to st. Vincent De Paul.

315
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,324
Four boxes. Good for her.

316
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,694
Oh, she wanted
you to have something.

317
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,701
It's her
engagement ring from don.

318
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:59,405
- Don't you want it?
- She wanted you to have it.

319
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,307
You shouldn't play
around with that.

320
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,543
Besides, I don't believe in it.

321
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,683
So are you going
back to school?

322
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,285
Not for the moment.

323
00:19:12,353 --> 00:19:14,954
What are you gonna do?

324
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:16,689
<i>I don't know.</i>

325
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,691
That's the best part, right?

326
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,560
Got the rest
of my life ahead of me.

327
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:21,828
So do you.

328
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,698
Now that's her.

329
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:45,618
Who's that?

330
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:49,422
- How was it?
- Most of it was fun.

331
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,325
- Daddy, are you coming in?
- I'm not wearing my bathing suit.

332
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:53,826
Come in.
You have to come in.

333
00:19:53,894 --> 00:19:56,362
- I want to be a shark.
- Come on, daddy.

334
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,533
You swim all the time
in New York.

335
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,335
I'm really beat.

336
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:29,195
Hey, should I throw
some herring to you two?

337
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:50,149
Dumbo. Mad tea party.

338
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,051
<i>And Mr. Toad.</i>

339
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,619
Gene can't go
on Mr. Toad.

340
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:55,521
I'll get it.

341
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,590
He can stay with Megan
while we go on the ride.

342
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:00,293
Then Megan can't go.

343
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,297
Hi, Sally.

344
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:07,366
This is my friend Camille.

345
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,903
Camille, this is don,
gene, Bobby and Sally.

346
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,672
Hello, everybody.

347
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,841
I just wanted to make sure you
didn't need anything else.

348
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:16,476
No, I think we're okay.

349
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:20,379
- Where are you going?
- The whisky a go go.

350
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:23,115
Well, good night, everybody.

351
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,851
Good night. Have fun.

352
00:21:31,158 --> 00:21:32,859
<i>What about Tomorrowland?</i>

353
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:34,427
I don't want
to ride an elephant.

354
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:36,295
I want to fly a jet.

355
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:41,118
<i>Hello.</i>

356
00:21:41,185 --> 00:21:43,820
<i>- Henry?
- I'm in here.</i>

357
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:48,859
I'm sorry.
Everyone was late

358
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:51,161
And then it took three of them to
light the pilot on the water heater.

359
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,196
Carla called looking for you.

360
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:55,966
Oh? And what
did she want?

361
00:21:56,034 --> 00:21:58,402
You know what she wanted.

362
00:21:58,469 --> 00:22:00,370
You fired her
and didn't tell me?

363
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:02,539
Well, I am sorry.

364
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:04,441
I didn't want her
invoking your sympathies.

365
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:07,778
- Why did you fire her?
- Because I don't trust her judgment.

366
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:10,047
What did she say?

367
00:22:10,114 --> 00:22:12,783
She said you wouldn't give her
a letter of recommendation.

368
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,518
How long did
the woman work for you?

369
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,787
I know she doesn't steal.
What did she do?

370
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:18,588
And don't tell me it's just
about the neighbor boy.

371
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:20,724
Sally is not allowed
to see him.

372
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:23,226
- Carla said he's her friend.
- "Carla said"?

373
00:22:23,294 --> 00:22:25,929
- "Carla said"?!
- I don't understand what you're doing.

374
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:28,999
You didn't want to move because you
wanted the kids to have some stability,

375
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,134
And then you get rid of their
nanny since they were born?

376
00:22:31,202 --> 00:22:33,170
I wanted a fresh start, okay?

377
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:35,973
<i>- I'm entitled to that.
- There is no fresh start!</i>

378
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,674
Lives carry on!

379
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:41,111
<i>Jesus, Henry.
Just once could you take my side?</i>

380
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:43,280
No one's ever
on your side, Betty.

381
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:15,679
<i>Just a minute.</i>

382
00:23:23,187 --> 00:23:24,721
Am I bothering you?

383
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,890
No, I was out on the
balcony enjoying the view.

384
00:23:28,626 --> 00:23:32,262
I heard you come in
and I wanted to go over

385
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,632
The plan for tomorrow
for Disneyland.

386
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,268
Do you think I should be involved
in such high-level decisions?

387
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,141
I can't turn on the TV.
They're asleep.

388
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:55,986
There's nothing on TV.

389
00:23:56,054 --> 00:23:57,988
Come outside with me.

390
00:23:58,056 --> 00:23:59,523
It's so beautiful here.

391
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:02,859
Did you have fun
with your friend?

392
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:05,362
Uh, not really.

393
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,130
She's not really my friend.

394
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:09,099
We just lived together
during college.

395
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:12,002
My father's a Professor.

396
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:14,037
I think she liked him too much.

397
00:24:24,215 --> 00:24:26,016
So why did you see her?

398
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,352
I don't know.

399
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,721
She's an actress now.

400
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:34,925
She's in two episodes
of "hogan's heroes."

401
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:38,295
She told me I could never
do it because of my teeth.

402
00:24:38,362 --> 00:24:39,963
She actually said that to me.

403
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:43,867
I don't even want
to be an actress.

404
00:24:47,605 --> 00:24:49,372
I love your teeth.

405
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:53,543
I took elocution lessons
when I moved to New York.

406
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:56,346
The teacher said I had
the mouth of a singer.

407
00:25:12,396 --> 00:25:14,197
Are you sure we should do this?

408
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:17,334
I've been thinking
about you so much.

409
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:07,817
Were you thinking about this
when I asked you to come?

410
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:13,990
It was the first thought
that went through my head.

411
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,361
I was gonna miss you
so much, anyway.

412
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:22,599
You don't know
anything about me.

413
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:24,534
But I do.

414
00:26:26,404 --> 00:26:28,238
I know that
you have a good heart

415
00:26:28,306 --> 00:26:31,474
And I know that you're
always trying to be better.

416
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,511
We all try.

417
00:26:35,947 --> 00:26:37,647
We don't always make it.

418
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:44,287
I've done a lot of things.

419
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:48,892
I know who you are now.

420
00:26:57,735 --> 00:26:59,736
It's getting light outside.

421
00:27:01,138 --> 00:27:03,673
I should get back
before the sun comes up.

422
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,978
They're little roosters.

423
00:27:12,016 --> 00:27:14,150
Then you should go.

424
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:16,253
I don't want to confuse them.

425
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:29,899
I want to know if I can knock on
this door again tomorrow night

426
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:32,836
Or if this is just what it is,

427
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:34,437
Like that night in the office.

428
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:37,874
I need to know.
I don't know why.

429
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:40,944
Because you're afraid?

430
00:27:42,446 --> 00:27:45,015
You shouldn't be.

431
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:52,989
Disneyland fireworks
are at 9:00.

432
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:58,628
How about dinner tomorrow night

433
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:00,797
At 11:00 right here?

434
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,167
We're gonna
be together all day.

435
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,085
This is art.
Art, Ken cosgrove and Patricia...

436
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:24,054
- What was it?
- Peggy Olson.

437
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,122
Sit.
I'd offer you coffee,

438
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,691
But everybody's gone
for the holiday.

439
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:29,359
The perils of being in charge.

440
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:33,863
So you can tell we don't
have a lot of time.

441
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:37,100
I mean not just today.
We're in kind of a bind.

442
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:39,369
We're no worse
than we were before,

443
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:41,604
- And I hated those people.
- Do you have the old work?

444
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:45,775
Somewhere. Look,
it was a gorgeous girl...

445
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:49,245
High heels, jewelry... pulling
up this Cinderella gown

446
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,014
To show the topaz.

447
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:53,616
But she wasn't Cinderella and
where the hell was she going?

448
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:56,753
We want
something that'll stand out.

449
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:58,455
I don't care if it's a cartoon.

450
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:00,390
I don't care if it's
Abe became wearing 'em.

451
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:03,293
We're a tiny company.
We need to make a stink.

452
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:06,429
Well, I've worn them
but what qualities,

453
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:08,898
In your mind, do they have
that make them unique?

454
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:11,134
You're wearing them right now?

455
00:29:11,202 --> 00:29:14,771
<i>Yes, because I can wear topaz
pantyhose with anything.</i>

456
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,273
I'm wearing them
at work right now

457
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,143
And I'll change everything but
my hose before I go out tonight.

458
00:29:20,211 --> 00:29:22,679
One pair... that's all
you need with topaz.

459
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:27,117
If we only sold each girl one
pair, we'd be out of business.

460
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,123
"topaz, the only pair of
pantyhose you'll ever need.

461
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,358
Bad for business.
Good for you."

462
00:29:36,627 --> 00:29:38,328
That's very funny,

463
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:40,230
'cause it says
our product's so good,

464
00:29:40,297 --> 00:29:42,732
We're not even interested
in ourselves.

465
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,101
Okay, that's one.
What else you got?

466
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:47,837
Um, well,

467
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:50,807
I'd have to think more,
but it might be great

468
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,575
To show a bunch
of different outfits...

469
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:54,778
One for formal,
one for business,

470
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:57,514
One a little sporty...

471
00:29:57,581 --> 00:30:00,550
And something like

472
00:30:00,618 --> 00:30:02,919
"single pair,
singular comfort."

473
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:04,921
It's got
the word "single" in it.

474
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:06,656
That's two.

475
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:29,576
Daddy, tell Sally that
snakes used to have legs.

476
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:31,111
I don't know if that's true.

477
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,579
You know it's true
in the bible.

478
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:34,648
We learned that
they used to be fish

479
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:36,950
And he doesn't know because
he has baby science.

480
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,853
- They found a skeleton.
- Where? You don't know.

481
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,156
- You're a short stuff.
- Okay, "Thally."

482
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:44,892
<i>- Shut up!
- Great.</i>

483
00:30:46,461 --> 00:30:49,096
We'll fix it.
It's just a milkshake.

484
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:53,500
Can you grab a straw or some napkins?
This is my last dress.

485
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,423
I'm sorry.
Is it late?

486
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,194
I wanted to let you sleep.

487
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:23,163
How long have you been up?

488
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,732
- A few hours.
- What's wrong?

489
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:30,237
I couldn't sleep.

490
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:33,874
I just kept thinking about you.

491
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,977
Well, I'm right here.

492
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,750
I don't know what
it is about you but...

493
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:47,721
I feel like myself

494
00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:50,557
When I'm with you,

495
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:53,093
But the way I always
wanted to feel.

496
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,800
Because I'm in love
with you, Megan,

497
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,835
And I think I have been
for a while.

498
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:05,539
Don.

499
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:11,445
Oh my goodness.

500
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,214
Open it.

501
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,455
It's beautiful.

502
00:32:23,157 --> 00:32:25,659
When I saw you sleeping
there, I thought...

503
00:32:28,263 --> 00:32:31,265
I couldn't imagine not seeing
you there every morning.

504
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:36,803
Will you marry me?

505
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,507
Oh, I-I-I...

506
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,944
I don't know what to say.

507
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:46,079
This is all so fast.

508
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:48,882
Did you ever think
of the number of things

509
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,752
That had to happen
for me to get to know you?

510
00:32:53,688 --> 00:32:54,988
But everything happened,

511
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,258
And it got me here.

512
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,061
What does that mean?

513
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,665
I can't believe this.

514
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:07,768
Yes. Yes.

515
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:22,783
You have a ring? How long have
you been thinking about this?

516
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,718
It's been in my family...

517
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:29,856
Not my family, really.

518
00:33:31,793 --> 00:33:33,593
It belonged to someone
very important to me.

519
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:37,130
I don't believe this.

520
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:39,232
I have to call my mother.

521
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,302
I had this feeling and I
called her from California

522
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,838
- Because I wanted it to go away.
- I saw it on the bill.

523
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:47,274
Sorry.
I-I... I have to call her.

524
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:48,809
Do you want me
to call her from work?

525
00:33:48,876 --> 00:33:51,578
No, call her.

526
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:53,380
What about work?
What do we do?

527
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,682
We tell everybody.

528
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,386
Oh. Okay.

529
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,026
Do you want me
to leave you alone?

530
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:09,229
- Do you want me to talk to her?
- Oh. Do you speak French?

531
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,042
<i>Maman, c'est moi.
J'ai Des nouvelles.</i>

532
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,344
<i>Va chercher papa,
Vite.</i>

533
00:34:26,013 --> 00:34:28,081
<i>What the
hell's going on?</i>

534
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,983
<i>I don't know.
He wouldn't say.</i>

535
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,285
Look, it's you...
brown as a Berry.

536
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:34,287
- How was the coast?
- Wonderful.

537
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:36,156
Joan, could you shut the door?

538
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,928
I have an announcement to make

539
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,830
And it shouldn't
change anything here

540
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:45,832
Except for me
and maybe for Joan.

541
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,536
But miss Calvet and I
are getting married.

542
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:53,807
- Who the hell's that?
- Megan.

543
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,542
Really?

544
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:01,448
Congratulations, don.

545
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,250
I wish you the best of luck.

546
00:35:04,419 --> 00:35:05,919
Megan out there?

547
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:07,521
Yeah, I know it's a surprise,

548
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:10,690
But she makes me very happy

549
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:13,293
And, well...

550
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,262
It's something
we both want very much.

551
00:35:16,497 --> 00:35:17,531
Well, let's get her in here.

552
00:35:20,234 --> 00:35:21,368
Megan.

553
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,841
- How exciting for you.
- I know.

554
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:30,444
- I can't believe it.
- Congratulations, dear.

555
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,679
You don't say "congratulations"
to the bride.

556
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:34,381
You say
"best wishes."

557
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:36,183
Congratulations, don.

558
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,652
Let's have a toast.
Megan, could you get us some ice?

559
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:41,822
I'm teasing.

560
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,890
See, don? This is
the way to behave.

561
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,662
- So when are you getting married?
- I don't know.

562
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,031
- We haven't discussed it.
- Soon.

563
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,434
Art Garten just called.

564
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:57,204
No. What did he say?

565
00:35:57,271 --> 00:36:00,106
He said he liked ideas two and
four and we've got a week.

566
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,714
- Shall we go rub it in?
- After you.

567
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:09,282
You did it.

568
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:15,555
- We've got some great news.
- Are you two getting married?

569
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:22,195
What's going on?

570
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:25,165
They're getting married.

571
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,135
- Really?
- Oh, congratulations.

572
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:31,004
- Thank you.
- It's incredible.

573
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:32,839
I know.
It just happened.

574
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:36,276
That's incredible.
You must be so happy.

575
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:42,182
Um, I'll get it.

576
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:48,021
We have
some news too. Peg.

577
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:50,524
Yes, we signed an account...

578
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:53,226
Topaz pantyhose.
It's a quarter of a million dollars.

579
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,562
- How'd you do that?
- Peggy found out about them

580
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,030
And then we met
over the holiday.

581
00:36:57,098 --> 00:36:59,699
That's great news.
We broke the streak.

582
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:03,036
What a great day.
Good work, both of you.

583
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,672
So anyway, I guess
we should tell everybody.

584
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,841
Topaz needs work this week.

585
00:37:07,909 --> 00:37:09,910
I hope you have
all the happiness

586
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,313
That Peggy and I had signing this account.

587
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:15,015
I'll be there in a minute.

588
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:25,959
It's been going on awhile,

589
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:29,896
But I appreciate your concern.

590
00:37:29,964 --> 00:37:32,999
Well, then I'm happy for you...

591
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:35,101
Both of you.

592
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:38,471
She's very beautiful.

593
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,308
You know she reminds me of you.

594
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:44,511
She's got the same spark.

595
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:48,515
I know she admires you
just as much as I do.

596
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:05,899
It was Dr. Miller again.

597
00:38:08,235 --> 00:38:10,904
It's not gonna get any
easier the longer you wait.

598
00:38:16,744 --> 00:38:19,212
Whatever could be on your mind?

599
00:38:23,618 --> 00:38:25,485
Can you believe it?

600
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,154
It happens all the time.

601
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,657
They're all just between marriages.
You know that.

602
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:33,994
He'll probably
make her a copywriter.

603
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,863
He's probably not going to want
to be married to his secretary.

604
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:40,333
Really? Is that
what he meant?

605
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,003
"She admires you"?

606
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,270
Jesus.

607
00:38:45,806 --> 00:38:48,008
That's the way
it works for some.

608
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:52,479
<i>You know, I just
saved this company.</i>

609
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:55,415
I signed the first new business
since lucky strike left,

610
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:57,517
But it's not as important
as getting married.

611
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,219
Again.

612
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:02,756
Well, I was just made director
of agency operations...

613
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:05,425
A title, no money of course...

614
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,427
And if they poured champagne,
it must've been

615
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:09,195
While I was pushing
the mail cart.

616
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:11,297
A pretty face comes along

617
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:12,899
And everything goes
out the window.

618
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,602
Well, I learned a long time ago

619
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,204
To not get all my
satisfaction from this job.

620
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:21,441
That's bullshit.

621
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,581
- Faye Miller.
- Hi, it's me.

622
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:45,552
I was starting to worry
you were ill or something.

623
00:39:46,787 --> 00:39:48,355
I need to talk to you.

624
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:50,924
Well, I was gonna
come by at lunch anyway.

625
00:39:50,992 --> 00:39:52,926
Oh, no, you shouldn't do that.

626
00:39:52,994 --> 00:39:54,361
Why don't we meet somewhere?

627
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,464
What is going on?

628
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,401
Something happened
and I'd like to talk to you

629
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:03,136
About it face to face.

630
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:04,771
Meet me for coffee.

631
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,274
Okay.

632
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,144
You know what?

633
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:13,613
I'm not gonna have
some conversation

634
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:15,482
And have to sit through
coffee afterwards.

635
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:17,984
Just get to it.

636
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:28,094
Well, I...

637
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:31,331
Met somebody...

638
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:36,569
And we're engaged.

639
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,805
Are you kidding me?

640
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:42,742
I know... I know it's a surprise.
It was for me too.

641
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:45,545
Jesus.

642
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:47,247
Who is she?

643
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:50,717
What's the difference?

644
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:52,652
I fell in love.

645
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:55,555
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

646
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:59,926
You've been
very important to me.

647
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:02,762
So you're not gonna put an ad

648
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,031
In "the New York times"
saying you never liked me?

649
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,068
- Faye.
- Well, I hope you're very happy,

650
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:11,504
And I hope she knows you only
like the beginnings of things.

651
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,542
I'm sorry.

652
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:17,477
I don't know what else to say.

653
00:41:17,545 --> 00:41:18,712
Goodbye.

654
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:34,995
I saw the light go off.

655
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,332
It's fine.
It's done.

656
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:49,442
I love you, you know.

657
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:04,391
And he's smiling like a fool,

658
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:06,760
Like he's the first man that
ever married his secretary.

659
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:09,396
She's 25, as if that's news.

660
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:11,464
<i>So when are you going
to tell them your news?</i>

661
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,466
They'll know soon enough.

662
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:16,770
Are you showing at all?
The picture I have of you doesn't change.

663
00:42:16,837 --> 00:42:19,639
I'll take a new one
and I'll send it to you.

664
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:22,042
You know all I want to know.

665
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:25,378
Yes, honey, they're bigger.

666
00:42:25,446 --> 00:42:27,981
Oh! Why are
you torturing me?

667
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:30,183
I just woke up
and it's already 90° here.

668
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:33,853
Listen, I've gotta go.

669
00:42:33,921 --> 00:42:36,156
<i>- Not yet.
- What?</i>

670
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,358
Not yet.

671
00:42:38,426 --> 00:42:41,895
Now you listen to the doctor. You have to eat.
Don't worry about your figure.

672
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:43,997
I'll whip you and the baby
into shape when I get back.

673
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,732
Okay.

674
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:49,135
I'll call you
Thursday night your time.

675
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:52,238
Okay. I love you.

676
00:42:52,306 --> 00:42:54,074
<i>I love you too.</i>

677
00:43:17,698 --> 00:43:20,667
<i>Hello?</i>

678
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:23,570
<i>Mrs. Truxton?</i>

679
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:25,605
No, it's me.

680
00:43:27,508 --> 00:43:30,710
- What are you doing here?
- It's Tuesday at 7:00.

681
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:32,912
I thought I told you I had a listing
appointment with the real estate Agent.

682
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:37,317
Oh, I didn't realize
that was today.

683
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:40,820
I forgot about the cabinets
in the guest bath.

684
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:42,489
So you weren't that thorough?

685
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:44,290
I guess not.

686
00:44:10,084 --> 00:44:13,186
<i>Do you like the new house?</i>

687
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:16,389
I do. It's got
a lot of character.

688
00:44:17,725 --> 00:44:19,526
I'll probably have to
tear out the kitchen.

689
00:44:23,597 --> 00:44:25,231
Remember this place?

690
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,935
I do.

691
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:32,805
It's different.
That's for certain.

692
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:35,842
Isn't that what you wanted?

693
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:38,878
I don't know, don.

694
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:45,084
Things aren't perfect.

695
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:49,656
So you'll move again.

696
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,263
So much change.

697
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,065
It's made everything...

698
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,101
Difficult.

699
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:10,276
I have to tell you something.

700
00:45:13,514 --> 00:45:15,048
I met someone.

701
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:19,686
I'm engaged.

702
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:23,756
Really?

703
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:29,128
Bethany Van Nuys?

704
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:32,232
No. Someone at work.

705
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:48,982
I'm very happy for you.

706
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:53,386
It's okay, Betty.

707
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:58,491
I don't know why I'm surprised.

708
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:04,597
Is she your secretary?
I know she watched the kids in California.

709
00:46:04,665 --> 00:46:05,932
Yes.

710
00:46:12,072 --> 00:46:15,041
So I will see you the weekend after next.
What is that, the 23rd?

711
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,542
I think so.

712
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:20,013
Wait.

713
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:33,493
Congratulations.

714
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,461
Thank you.

715
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,540
