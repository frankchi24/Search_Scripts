1
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:42,088
I'm interested in today. That was Friday.

2
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,800
Look, I'll clear lunch plus one hour

3
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,052
and we'll grab a sandwich
and discuss this face to face.

4
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,721
I'm hanging up.

5
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,578
Is it broken?

6
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,118
The lamp?

7
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,624
What are you doing all the way over there?

8
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,171
It's too hot.

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,293
Would you settle for a leg?

10
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,966
I'd be grateful.

11
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,639
It's cold and soft.

12
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,016
I'm the softest.

13
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,400
So which one of us
is gonna look at the clock first?

14
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,493
I caught it when I was picking up the lamp.

15
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,532
I'm already late.

16
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,913
For what?

17
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,207
Secor Laxatives.

18
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,173
Did I spoil the mood?

19
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,252
What do you have to do?

20
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,804
I have a 4:00 at Erwin, Wasey.

21
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,840
Doing what?

22
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,016
I can't tell you that, Mr. Bond.

23
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,636
I told you.

24
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,728
What are you working on over there?

25
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,397
I don't tell them what I'm doing for you.

26
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,856
But you're not lying in bed
with them right now either.

27
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,190
Do you know what a Chinese wall is?

28
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,618
I really should go.

29
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,533
Can I get in the bathroom first?

30
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,286
Just take your time.

31
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,001
Let yourself out.

32
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,845
Lock the door behind you, as a courtesy.

33
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,890
You wanna leave me here?

34
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:55,680
You sure?

35
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,142
I'm taking everything interesting with me.

36
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,150
I don't understand. Do you honestly think
my book isn't better than Ogilvy's?

37
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:15,830
Mine's got a story.
It's got mystery, intrigue, romance.

38
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,407
I tell you what else it's got.
It's got examples of how to sell things.

39
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,414
Hold on.

40
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,872
I'm on the phone.

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,924
It's Mrs. Sterling.
She's leaving for the weekend.

42
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,420
It's only Wednesday,
and they have phones in Southampton.

43
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,589
Ira, I don't want to sound ungrateful.
I just think...

44
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,850
Hello? Hello?

45
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,636
Oh, shit.

46
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,515
Come in.

47
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,061
These need signatures, not initials.

48
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,608
Caroline said you refused?

49
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,690
It's just so much more work.

50
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,699
I was just giving her a hard time.

51
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,456
Can I interest you in the same?

52
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,206
And I'm supposed to tell you in person
that Mr. Pryce will be taking off

53
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,333
the last two weeks of August
for his son's visit.

54
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,126
You had to tell me that in person?

55
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,672
-So depressing.
-He doesn't want a memo circulating.

56
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,424
He's afraid people will stop working.

57
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,009
What are you doing in August?

58
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,847
I'm not sure.

59
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,802
Well, what are you doing this afternoon?

60
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,933
The same thing
I do every afternoon, working,

61
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,186
which is what I'm trying to do right now.

62
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,810
It's not cute.

63
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,936
Jeanie.

64
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,814
Jesus. I'm sorry.

65
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,445
What did you say to her?

66
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,113
What does that have to do with you?

67
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,495
Her husband got called up.

68
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,448
He's going to Vietnam right after basic.

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,242
Vietnam.

70
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,793
That's not good.

71
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,335
It's okay.
We've all been walking on eggshells.

72
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,050
Good afternoon, all.

73
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,257
I know you don't like to be bombarded
the moment you walk in,

74
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,593
but Fillmore and Secor
are both coming in tomorrow.

75
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,769
I can't move forward with either
until you sign off

76
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,471
on what I worked through lunch to finish.

77
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,228
I'm sorry.
I had a long lunch, went for a swim.

78
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,105
Come back in an hour. I'm taking a nap.

79
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:18,407
It's a business of sadists and masochists,
and you know which one you are.

80
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,830
-Hi.
-Peggy, your boyfriend's here.

81
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,204
Satisfaction guaranteed.

82
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,585
-Why are you here?
-Thought we could get a drink,

83
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,799
-shoot the bull.
-Sure. What time? Where?

84
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,595
When you're alone
And life is making you lonely

85
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,388
You can always go

86
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,965
7:00, P.J. Clarke's.

87
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,721
Midtown

88
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,810
I'll meet you in the lobby.

89
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,721
Down below.

90
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,394
Give it a break, Jughead.

91
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,064
I'm not shocked by your lesbian hijinks.

92
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:56,649
I just hope you know you can never do
what a man can do.

93
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,241
That's true.

94
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,415
Bad news. Don showed up. We're on at 4:00.

95
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,636
-How was your siesta? Are you refreshed?
-Yes.

96
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,180
Dr. Miller returned your call.

97
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,259
She said not to wake you
and you needn't return.

98
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,436
But she got the message,
and you're gonna have to wait.

99
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,399
-Thank you.
-Are you going to the toilet?

100
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,939
I have to hire more copywriters,
but these men come in and I know

101
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,366
the better they are,
the more my job is in danger.

102
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,576
Oh, my.

103
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,160
Look who's here. Abe.

104
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,745
Peggy, I don't know if you remember
Abe Drexler from Kellogg's loft party.

105
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,372
-Hi, I'm Peggy.
-I remember.

106
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,965
Abe, you want to join us for a drink?

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,628
-Yes, please do.
-Stay. I'll just stand here.

108
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,718
Can I get a Johnnie Walker with ice?

109
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,305
He didn't hear me.

110
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,846
You know what? I'm gonna go play darts.

111
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,023
-Take my seat.
-Are you sure?

112
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,143
Pay for that. See you kids later.

113
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,652
I'm sorry.
She's always so damn self-amused.

114
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,736
What are you talking about?

115
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,373
I was gonna stop by your office,
but I didn't want to get you in trouble.

116
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,502
Then I thought about finding out
where you live, but that's weird.

117
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,129
So anyway,

118
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,042
-it's nice running into you.
-I don't know what to say.

119
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,506
That's very flattering-

120
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,925
That's howl meant it.

121
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,684
Johnnie Walker. Rocks.

122
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,601
The bartender here listens to me.

123
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,700
-May I help you?
-Are you Joan Harris?

124
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,533
-I am.
-We're from Madam lnga's.

125
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,746
You are to receive massage,
manicure and pedicure.

126
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,958
-Can we?
-I didn't order this.

127
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,044
It's a gift from a friend, tip included.

128
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,052
-What friend?
-I'm not allowed to say this.

129
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,272
In Greece right now?
Make no mistake, that's a revolution.

130
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,821
We are a hair away from everything
falling apart in every society.

131
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,068
It's so tenuous.

132
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,401
All these corporations
just throw their money at everyone

133
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,952
to keep the status quo intact
'cause the people outnumber them.

134
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,324
But in the blink of an eye,
they could overturn everything.

135
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,957
It's an illusion that America's so organized
and it could never happen over here.

136
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,543
-Are you from Brooklyn?
-I am.

137
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,423
-Me, too.
-I don't hear it.

138
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,096
One more drink and it'll come out.

139
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,266
Okay.

140
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,979
What am I talking to you
about corporations for?

141
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,183
-You must deal with them all the time.
-I guess.

142
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,643
Vick chemical, American tobacco,

143
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,524
but most of them are family businesses,

144
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,402
Samsonite, Fillmore Auto Parts,
Sugarberry Ham...

145
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,031
Fillmore Auto Parts is worse than
a corporation, what with the boycott and all.

146
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:31,033
-What boycott?
-The Southern stores won't hire negroes.

147
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,448
Says who?

148
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,625
It was in the Voice.
It was in a couple of places.

149
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,628
I don't think that's true.
I would've heard that.

150
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,130
It is true.

151
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,878
That doesn't seem like them.

152
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,336
I'm sure they're perfectly nice for racists,
you know,

153
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,881
and obviously your company has
an investment in looking the other way.

154
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,011
Well, it's a complicated idea,

155
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,815
but in advertising,
we don't really judge people.

156
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,812
We try and help them out
of these situations.

157
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,318
Certainly we would try and stop this.

158
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,320
If it's true, it's not good for their business.

159
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,573
Jesus, I don't even know where to start.

160
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,276
You would've done
a campaign for Goldwater?

161
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,369
You kidding?
That would've been spectacular.

162
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,577
-Did you vote for him?
-Of course not.

163
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,419
Civil rights isn't a situation to be fixed
with some PR campaign.

164
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,122
It's an inequality
that the world has its eyes on.

165
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,165
I know.

166
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,420
But I have to say,

167
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:32,098
most of the things negroes can't do,
I can't do either,

168
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,766
and nobody seems to care.

169
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,011
What are you talking about?

170
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,768
Half of the meetings take place
over golf, tennis,

171
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,976
in a bunch of clubs
where I'm not allowed to be a member,

172
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,560
or even enter.

173
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,149
The University Club said
the only way I could eat dinner there

174
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,401
was if I arrived in a cake.

175
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,032
There's no negro copywriters, you know.

176
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,868
I'm sure they could fight their way in
like I did.

177
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,705
Believe me, nobody wanted me there.

178
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,043
All right, Peggy.
We'll have a civil rights march for women.

179
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,793
I have a really early day.

180
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,219
It was nice to see you again.

181
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,635
I'm just saying they're not shooting women
to keep them from voting. That's all.

182
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,055
Jesus. I'm really sorry.

183
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,349
I'm much better on paper.

184
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,732
You're opinionated
and you're criticizing me.

185
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,901
That's not what I'm doing. This is discourse.

186
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,483
I knew I shouldn't have let Joyce leave.

187
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,065
Have a good night.

188
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,825
A three-letter word for a flightless bird.

189
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,326
Emu.

190
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,207
Nope. It starts with an "L."

191
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,163
The hell it does.

192
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,049
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

193
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,377
Could I get some coffee?
And let me know when Dr. Miller arrives.

194
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,095
It's hard, the way she breezes past me.

195
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,929
She's pushy, that one.

196
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,227
I guess that's what it takes.

197
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,690
-Morning.
-Good morning.

198
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,272
-And thank you.
-For what?

199
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,115
That was very thoughtful.

200
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,698
I Knew I was rubbing you the wrong way,

201
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,075
so I thought, why not have
someone rub you the right way?

202
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,866
-I brought you bear claws.
-Caroline won't let me have one

203
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,793
unless it's on the end of a real bear.

204
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,921
-Well, anyway.
-Jeanie.

205
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,300
-it'll be okay.
-People love to say that.

206
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,555
Look, I know you're having a tough run.

207
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,132
Let me get you a meal.

208
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,683
Take your mind off things?

209
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,387
Of course.

210
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,308
I forgot for a second that you're
incapable of doing something nice

211
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,234
without expecting something nicer in return.

212
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,944
I didn't mean anything by it.

213
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,487
Honest.

214
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,322
Just thought you could use a night out.

215
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:55,491
-Thank you. I'm fine.
-Good.

216
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,038
-What are you doing here?
-I wrote something.

217
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,047
I kind of wrote it for you.

218
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,504
I would love it if you read it.

219
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,505
Nuremberg on Madison Avenue?

220
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,094
-What is this?
-it's what I was trying to say last night,

221
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,020
but without, I don't know, my abrasive tone.
Read it.

222
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,019
Right now in front of you?

223
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,059
No, take your time. I'll wait over here.

224
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,231
I have a lot to do.

225
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,860
I came all the way up here.
I want to know what you think, okay?

226
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,448
These domesticated suburbanites

227
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,250
still have a primitive desire
to get their hands dirty,

228
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,579
but they have become
so removed from nature that they can't.

229
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,381
They don't know how to hunt
or swing a hammer or fix their cars.

230
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,212
You mean like these two.

231
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,218
Actually, no. I'm from Vermont,
and Don's a competitive fly fisherman.

232
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,517
What our findings show
is that this demographic

233
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,970
will spend a good amount of money

234
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,431
for the satisfaction
of being useful with their hands.

235
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,184
Ladies love a man
who's good with his hands.

236
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,479
You think a mechanic comes in
and sees these jokers

237
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,405
looking at fan belts,
he's gonna stick around?

238
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,071
No offense.

239
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,028
What's the difference?
Our inventory's the same.

240
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,490
I think if they see a coat and tie in aisle four,
they'll think our prices went up.

241
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,665
I know I would.

242
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,120
Listen, salt of the earth,
we need more than mechanics to survive.

243
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,080
You ever hear of Sears? They'll kill us.

244
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,048
We agreed we all had to agree.

245
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,125
Don't we have enough problems
with the boycott?

246
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,887
Look, I don't want to get involved
in a family squabble,

247
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,011
but I can't move forward
until you agree on a strategy.

248
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,095
What if there were a way
to market to both groups?

249
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,851
"Fillmore Auto Parts.

250
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,433
"Where the pros go,
and everyone's welcome."

251
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,110
-it's a little corny.
-it's great and you know it.

252
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,025
That's not a strategy. That's two strategies
connected by the word "and."

253
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,278
I can do "where the pros go,"
or I can do "everyone's welcome,"

254
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,571
-but not both.
-Sure you can.

255
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,879
Someone has to make a decision.
There are three of you.

256
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,127
Vote.

257
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,459
Sean, what do you think?

258
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,627


259
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,175
-...don't know.
-What?

260
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,645
You'll have to excuse me for a moment.
Continue, please.

261
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:38,981
Why do we have to convince him?

262
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,613
What are you doing here?

263
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,204
I wanted to see you.

264
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,578
I am so sorry. Who are you?

265
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,785
My name is Vivian Winters,

266
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,589
and I'm going to assume you're her father
since that's what she's led me to believe.

267
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,916
Don. What exactly is going on?

268
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,845
I found her on the train between carriages
trying to avoid the conductor.

269
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,054
I didn't have enough money.

270
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,804
Megan, could you take her to my office?

271
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:10,686
Go.

272
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,400
Thank you.

273
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,815
Can I pay you for the ticket and your time?

274
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:22,149
You're just very lucky I ran into her
before someone else did.

275
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,280
The types on that train?
Someone should keep track of her.

276
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,491
You're right. I didn't know.

277
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,156
Men never know what's going on.

278
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,577
I offered you money and I said thank you.

279
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,010
She looks so chubby in the pictures.

280
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,587
Get her mother on the phone now.

281
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,140
What do you think you're doing?

282
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,849
I wanted to see you
and I didn't want to wait two weekends.

283
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,232
You can't do this. This is very serious.

284
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,945
Mrs. Francis is on the line.

285
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,659
Guess who's sitting on my couch right now.

286
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,951
What are you talking about?

287
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,489
I'm talking about a stranger
bringing Sally to my office

288
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,323
because she got on the train with no money.

289
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:13,616
You're kidding.

290
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,618
Carla was supposed
to pick her up after the doctor.

291
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,918
How the hell did this happen?

292
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,667
Dr. Keener thought it would be good for her

293
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,714
to walk from camp
to her appointment by herself.

294
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,255
Great idea. Thank you, psychiatry.

295
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,920
Don't yell at me.
She needs to learn responsibility.

296
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,422
You need to learn responsibility.

297
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,174
Now come get her.
I've got a business to run here.

298
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:33,853
Because it's so easy.
It's so much fun to take care of her.

299
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:34,929
Enjoy.

300
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,764
-What?
-Enjoy, Don.

301
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,397
I'm meeting Henry in the city
tomorrow night. I'll get her then.

302
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,112
Don't move and don't touch anything.

303
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,621
I don't want to hear it.
Just make sure she doesn't leave that room.

304
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,470
Are you serious with this?

305
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,894
Everyone knows
who represents Fillmore Auto Parts.

306
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,597
-We're the agency of record.
-But I was defending you.

307
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,350
We have a religion in this country
and it's business.

308
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,606
You're not a priest.
You're just another congregant.

309
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,107
So I'm not a war criminal.

310
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,319
Look, why should someone
nice like you have to do this?

311
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,196
Why should you have to be a part
of that corruption?

312
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,573
It's a waste of yours
and a million other artists' gifts.

313
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,871
If you publish this, I'll lose my job.

314
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,573
Maybe you're better than this.

315
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,913
I'm not a political person.

316
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,961
I don't have to defend myself.

317
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,840
You're political whether you like it or not.

318
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,340
And you're not supposed to be insulted,
you're supposed to be flattered.

319
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,761
Are you crazy?

320
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,807
You inspired me. I wrote this for you.

321
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,555
I guess I read you wrong.

322
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,597
You look so earnest.

323
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,974
I need your word that you'll destroy that.

324
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,276
Sure.

325
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,483
I won't bother you again.

326
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,703
Miss Blankenship.

327
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,964
Miss Blankenship, are you all right?

328
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,878
Miss Blankenship.

329
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,178
Miss Blankenship.

330
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:38,811
Caroline. Oh, God. Caroline!

331
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,440
-Do not come out of there.
-I know!

332
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,652
What now?

333
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,951
Excuse me, Mr. Draper.
I'm really sorry to bother you again.

334
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,079
-Are you sure?
-I'm afraid so.

335
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,705
What happened?

336
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,380
Jesus.

337
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,258
Poor thing.

338
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,431
Should we call an ambulance?

339
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,055
The coroner.

340
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:21,846
What about them?

341
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,938
-I'll attend to this.
-Sally's in there.

342
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,816
-Why?
-She's visiting.

343
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,699
Megan, get a man, and we'll need a blanket.

344
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,619
There's an afghan on Mr. Crane's couch.

345
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,007
She seemed fine just a minute ago.

346
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,519
So where are we?

347
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,894
-Have we agreed on a strategy?
-I'm not sure.

348
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,358
This is where we are.

349
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,149
Correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen,

350
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,277
but we believe by holding
onto Fillmore's reputation

351
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:19,954
as a place for professional mechanics,
we can actually attract men of all types.

352
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,539
So it's something like

353
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,836
"Fillmore Auto Parts.
For the mechanic in every man."

354
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,127
And although it seems immaterial to you,
the Fillmore brothers like it.

355
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,591
Unanimously.

356
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,388
What was that again?

357
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,178
"Fillmore Auto Parts.
For the mechanic in every man."

358
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,073
My mother made that.

359
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,375
Can we get your signature?

360
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,252
I'm the president.

361
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,555
I think this is a winner.

362
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,688
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

363
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,893
-Ken, can you show them out?
-Of course. This way.

364
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,867
My goodness. I was just talking to her-

365
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,959
Listen, my daughter is sitting in my office.

366
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,620
-What?
-She decided to run away today.

367
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,668
-Sally?
-I'd really appreciate it

368
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,294
if you could go in my bag, get my keys,

369
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,253
take her to my apartment
and just sit with her.

370
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:00,088
Are you sure?

371
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,135
I would have my secretary do it,
but she's dead.

372
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,765
No, of course.
Okay, do you want to introduce me?

373
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,767
I mean, what do I say to her?

374
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,224
Do we really have to have
this discussion right now?

375
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,565
You're Faye.

376
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,063
Find Cooper and Roger at lunch

377
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,864
and stop them
from bringing Secor back here.

378
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,656
Sally, this is my friend Faye.

379
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,364
-She's going to take you to my apartment.
-why?

380
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,290
You don't want this to get worse.
Believe me.

381
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,835
Hello. My name is Faye.

382
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,633
I know. My dad just said that.

383
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,065
Stop.

384
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,861
-Where are they taking her?
-She's going to the morgue.

385
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,280
No, she's not.
She's going to Frank E. Campbell.

386
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,909
Anyone track down her family?

387
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,954
She has a niece. I'll call her.

388
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,751
I'm sorry, Bert.

389
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,629
Roger.

390
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,059
You should go home.

391
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:37,481
-Yes. Take all my calls up here.
-Okay.

392
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,823
So Fitzgerald says,
“I promised to pour this whiskey

393
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,868
"over your grave earlier, but do you mind
if I pass it through me kidneys first?"

394
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:58,415
-Are you all right?
-Damn it, I don't want to die in this office.

395
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,717
-I almost have twice.
-Stop it.

396
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,179
If it looks like I'm going, open a window.
I'd rather flatten the top of a cab.

397
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,726
You are not going to die in this office.

398
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,055
Poor Ida.

399
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,940
She died like she lived.

400
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,069
Surrounded by the people
she answered phones for.

401
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:29,032
I'm gonna go to my favorite restaurant
and have a glass of cyanide.

402
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,615
Or you could join me.

403
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:34,791
I don't know.

404
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,458
-I'm gonna kill myself, Jeanie.
-No, you're not.

405
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,878
Go get your things.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

406
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,963
I got it.

407
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,763
-Hello, Daddy.
-Don't "Hello, Daddy" me.

408
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:57,974
Go sit down.

409
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,067
-How was it?
-Great.

410
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,737
We watched a little TV, one of us took a nap.

411
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,781
You want to stay? You're gonna need to eat.

412
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,413
I Know, but I have dinner plans.

413
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,132
-Thank you.
-Glad I could help.

414
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,302
-Good night, Sally.
-Good night,

415
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,848
Can we order a pizza?

416
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,354
I want you to promise me
you're never going to do this again.

417
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,322
I promise.

418
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,039
Why did you always pick this place?

419
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:04,048
No chance of running into anyone
and, of course, cherry cheesecake.

420
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,426
Well, the clientele is older than I remember.

421
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,837
But not us.

422
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,181
I wish you would talk to me about things.

423
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,021
My husband doesn't like it.

424
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:21,269
I know it's tough,

425
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:24,318
but you must've known
about the possibilities when he signed up.

426
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,321
I wasn't consulted.

427
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,860
You're kidding.

428
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,989
Because you always
tell Jane about all of your decisions?

429
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,075
She's the woman behind the man, isn't she?

430
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,242
Did you listen to my memoirs?

431
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:44,122
I just have them transcribed
and recycle the tapes.

432
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,378
And you're not a little curious
if there's a chapter called "Joan"?

433
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,543
There better not be.

434
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,430
I know. That's the problem.

435
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,513
And every time I think back,
all the good stuff was with you.

436
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,182
And I'm sorry I keep pestering you.

437
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,559
I just can't help myself.

438
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,357
I don't expect anything to happen.

439
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:10,614
I appreciate that.

440
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,873
Can I ask you something?

441
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,745
Yes, I'm still mad at you.

442
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,248
Are you going to marry Faye?

443
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,542
What? No.

444
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,130
-Is she your girlfriend?
-No.

445
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,015
She had your keys.

446
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,764
I gave her my keys.

447
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,602
She knew you had peanut butter.

448
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,436
Everyone has peanut butter.

449
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,571
She Said She Wanted to meet me.

450
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,816
Why would she want to meet me?

451
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,706
Look, I do like her,

452
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,080
but we just work together,
and I talk about you a lot.

453
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,083
Do you like her?

454
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,627
-She seems nice.
-Well, good.

455
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,584
Maybe you'll get to see her again some time.

456
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,099
Get out some plates.

457
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,652
'Cause I didn't want to take a cab
on Broadway. It's a beautiful night.

458
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,149
I don't like this neighborhood anymore.
What happened?

459
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,825
Miss Blankenship,
you're not missing anything.

460
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,827
-Do you know what time it is?
-I do.

461
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,320
Oh, God.

462
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,163
You know what to do.

463
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,959
-Roger...
-Yes. Yes, we do. Look down.

464
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,503
Everything's going to be fine.

465
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,136
-There you go.
-What about her?

466
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,678
Your bag.

467
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,854
Rings.

468
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,696
That's everything.
We haven't seen anything.

469
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,571
I can't breathe.

470
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,582
-I want to scream.
-Don't. Come over here.

471
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,121
-You have to calm down.
-My ring. My ring.

472
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,376
Stop it. Everything can be replaced.

473
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,332
You're fine.

474
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,647
Don't stop.

475
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,535
Are you sure you don't want
to call your mother or your brothers?

476
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,418
It's 9:30. They're asleep.

477
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,090
Daddy, I love you so much.

478
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,554
I love you, too.

479
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,645
Did you brush your hair?

480
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,769
I want to live with you all the time.

481
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,144
You can't do that, honey.

482
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,109
Why not? I'll be good.

483
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,783
Where are you gonna go
to school down here?

484
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,744
What about your friends?
What about your brothers?

485
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,161
They could live here, too. I'll watch them.

486
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,289
Sally.

487
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,371
Go to sleep.

488
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,864
-Sally?
-I made French toast.

489
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,993
You know I don't like you using the stove.

490
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,321
Daddy, I do it all the time.

491
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,077
And there's no shells in it.

492
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,253
Do you want me to turn on the TV?
We can watch The Today Show.

493
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,416
No.

494
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,258
-Where'd you learn how to do this?
-Carla taught me.

495
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,590
What's on this?

496
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:26,763
Mrs. Butterworth's.

497
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,215
Go get it.

498
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,566
That's rum. Read labels.

499
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,861
Is it bad?

500
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,363
Not really.

501
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,405
Get dressed
and I'll get you a bun at the office.

502
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,323
Can't we do something?

503
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,870
All right, here's the deal. No negotiating.

504
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,878
I'm gonna call in, move everything to noon,
and we're gonna go to the Central Park Zoo.

505
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,799
And the dinosaur museum?

506
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,887
One or the other. We only have till noon.

507
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,598
You finish your breakfast.
I'm going to get ready.

508
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,982
You want me to get Don to do it?

509
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,934
Of course, he didn't really know her.

510
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,271
No, he didn't.

511
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,950
Caroline, get Mrs. Harris.

512
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,736
It's regarding Ida Blankenship's obit.

513
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,039
That ought to get her in here.

514
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,456
This is an insult to her.
I can't think of anything.

515
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,126
And I have no office in which to ruminate.

516
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:50,264
Cooper's trying to write an obit,
something sharp and sweet.

517
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:56,429
Well, Mr. Cooper, shall we say,

518
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:01,688
"Loyal friend, devoted caretaker..."

519
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,943
Put "quietly in her sleep," of course.

520
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,364
-What's her profession? Secretary?
-Executive secretary.

521
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,409
She was born in 1898 in a barn.

522
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,705
She died on the 37th floor of a skyscraper.

523
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,033
She's an astronaut.

524
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,836
Is this what it took to get you in here?

525
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,885
Look, I'm sorry.

526
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,639
It was in the heat of the moment.

527
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,187
And there was a moment. You know that.

528
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,896
I'm not sorry,

529
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,228
but I'm married.

530
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,688
And so are you.

531
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:53,197
I feel something, and I know you do.

532
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,544
Good afternoon.

533
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,296
-Hello.
-Sally, this is Megan.

534
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,549
Where's Miss Blankenship?

535
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,719
She went away.
I'm helping out for a little bit.

536
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,557
Her mother should be by at 5:00.
Can you handle five minutes?

537
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,475
Are you hungry?

538
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,560
She ate plenty.

539
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,392
I'm gonna get coffee and check in.

540
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,275
Shit. Now we can't leave-

541
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:39,077
Harry said, on the form where it says
"cause of death," they wrote "Don Draper."

542
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,293
How long do you think
Yvette Mimieux's gonna last on his desk?

543
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,631
I say we start a pool
on whether she's tired, quits or dies.

544
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,679
Where's Dr. Miller?

545
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,802
-I don't know if she's coming in.
-She is.

546
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:01,686
The Fillmores want a jingle, a catchy tune.

547
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,435
Don't do that.

548
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,776
Harry says no rock and roll
if we want middle-class men.

549
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,438
He was pushing Perry Como.

550
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:16,276
And we had Pat Boone, Roger Miller,
Frankie Laine, Duane Eddy.

551
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,785
I'm glad I came in for this.

552
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,156
How about Harry Belafonte?

553
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,078
Everyone likes him.

554
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,495
I'll get you tickets to Harry Belafonte.

555
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,126
Believe me, he ain't selling auto parts
for these guys.

556
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,633
Maybe it'll help them
with their image in the South.

557
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:34,590
They don't want help.

558
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,254
Have you ever been to the South?

559
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,557
'Cause they have a way of doing things,
and it doesn't include Harry Belafonte.

560
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,514
The Fillmore brothers are from Boston.

561
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,635
Same thing.

562
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,898
Why are we doing business
with someone who doesn't hire negroes?

563
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:57,117
Our job is to make men like Fillmore Auto,
not Fillmore Auto like negroes.

564
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,117
Pick one, get it written and recorded,

565
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,704
and if they want to change it,
we will charge them to change it.

566
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,342
How about Dean Martin?
He's friends with Sammy Davis Jr.

567
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,340
Does that work for you, Peggy?

568
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,676
Mrs. Francis is going
to be in the lobby any minute.

569
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,808
I have to cover reception, per Joan's orders.

570
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,514
Go ahead.

571
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,319
Your mother's going
to be downstairs in a minute.

572
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,272
-Get your things,
-I wanna stay.

573
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:37,778
You can't.

574
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,034
I want to stay and I don't know why I can't.

575
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,362
Because you have to go home.

576
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,827
I'll be good. I promise.

577
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,122
-Come on.
-No.

578
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,373
No! No!

579
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,755
No, no! I'm not going anywhere! Stop it!

580
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,003
Do you want me to carry you out of here?

581
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,844
I'm not going. I'm not leaving. I hate it there!

582
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,346
Is everything okay?

583
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,973
-Can you talk to her?
-What?

584
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:08,980
Please. I can't bring her back
kicking and screaming to her mother.

585
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,476
-I don't have much child psychology.
-Just talk to her.

586
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,358
Dr. Faye wants to talk to you.

587
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,580
Hi, Sally. Remember me from yesterday?

588
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,833
I know you don't want to go,
but you have to.

589
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,127
Your mother came all the way out here.

590
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,749
You don't know my mother.

591
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,464
Sally.

592
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,259
Sally,

593
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,850
sometimes we have to do things
we don't want to do.

594
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:47,928
-Shut up.
-What's gotten into you?

595
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:49,642
I don't think I'm helping here.

596
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,230
We don't want your help.

597
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:55,523
-Let's go, now.
-Stop it! No! Stop it!

598
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:16,714
It's gonna be all right.

599
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,799
No, it's not.

600
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,465
I fall all the time.

601
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:33,057
I was coming to get you. Mrs... Your...

602
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,646
Sally's mother is in reception.

603
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:39,821
Thank you.

604
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,167
I was worried about you.

605
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,256
Come on, let's go.

606
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,807
I was waiting in the lobby at 5:00.

607
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,848
-We lost track of time.
-Now I'm late.

608
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,222
Sally?

609
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,516
Say goodbye to your father.

610
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,518
Goodbye.

611
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,614
Excuse me.

612
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,536
Thank you.

613
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,458
Hi. Are you here to see Peggy?

614
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,722
Can you make me one of those?

615
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,810
No. No, I can't.

616
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,268
I can't do anything for you.

617
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,145
Why are you upset?

618
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,897
You shouldn't have put me in that position.

619
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,070
Things happen. I didn't plan it.

620
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,572
You asked me to go watch her.

621
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:10,494
There was no one else to do it.

622
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,868
And just now? What the hell was that?

623
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,784
I'm not good with kids.

624
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,702
That was not your fault.

625
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,538
Well, it feels like there was a test
and l failed it.

626
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,757
God knows I'd be lying
if I said it didn't cross my mind,

627
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,430
would I meet your children?
When would I meet your children?

628
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,678
But I don't have any.

629
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:44,821
I'm sorry.

630
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,946
I love children, but I chose to be where I am.

631
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,365
I don't view it as a failure.

632
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,406
It doesn't matter.

633
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,127
I mean it.

634
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:07,969
Jesus. What a mess.

635
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,641
Part of it's good, right?

636
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:18,930
Yeah.

637
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,150
I'm gonna go. I didn't really sleep.

638
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,703
We can have dinner this weekend.
I'll pick a place.

639
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,284
Good.

640
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,192
Why are you drinking here?

641
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,566
Come on.

642
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:11,695
I don't know what kind of surprise
you're gonna spring on me.

643
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:17,618
So Abe Drexler pulled a boner.
it's to be expected.

644
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,333
He seemed so nice.

645
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,829
He's a man.
He won't be happy until he turns you out.

646
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,667
What's that supposed to mean?

647
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:31,131
You gotta be their girl.
It's the way they want it. Maybe it's biology.

648
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:34,051
It's like men are this vegetable soup,

649
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:37,384
and we can't put them on a plate
or eat them off the counter.

650
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,055
So women are the pot.

651
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,563
They heat them up. They hold them.
They contain them.

652
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,226
But who wants to be a pot?

653
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,356
Who the hell said we're not soup?

654
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,447
I don't think that's true.

655
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,650
It's been my experience.

656
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,446
But you know,
I wouldn't have helped Abe out

657
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,123
if I didn't think
he was some very interesting soup.

658
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,462
Listen, go ahead without me.

659
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,505
Another time.

660
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:10,834
Are you angry or lovesick?

661
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,343
I don't know.

662
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,089
Night, Peg.

663
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,467
Could you hold that?

664
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,972
Hello.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
