1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,327
I wanna marry you.

2
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:09,103
<i>Last season on AMC's Mad Men...</i>

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,392
Well, ho-ho.
Now it's the time.

4
00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:13,167
Gentlemen, Jai Alai.

5
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,143
I made an appointment with
the divorce attorney.

6
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:17,223
Forget it. I'm not gonna let
you break up this family.

7
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:18,624
I didn't break up this family.

8
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,735
P.P.L. is being sold and
us along with it.

9
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:22,439
- Fire us.
- Why would I?

10
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:23,798
We'll make you a partner.

11
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:25,791
- Who the hell is Henry Francis?
- No one.

12
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,367
You're a whore!

13
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:31,655
Pete, we're starting a new agency.

14
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,231
We're here to talk to
you about joining us.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,759
Henry, I have three children.

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,288
I don't want you
owing them anything.

17
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:39,046
I want you to know that
I'm not gonna fight you.

18
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:41,887
Thank you. Goodbye.

19
00:00:42,103 --> 00:00:43,639
Mommy, she's not Margaret,
she's Jane.

20
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:44,855
She's my wife.

21
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:46,581
I need you to find
me an apartment.

22
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,670
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce,
how may I help you?

<i>Who is don draper?</i>

25
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,697
Excuse me?

26
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:44,133
Who is don draper?

27
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,873
What do men say
when you ask that?

28
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:52,110
Well, they usually take
a minute to think about it

29
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,879
Then they do something cute.

30
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:56,648
One creative director
said he was a lion tamer.

31
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,984
I don't want to do that.

32
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,321
- In the third person?
- I don't know.

33
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:07,024
Knockout wife, two kids,
house in Westchester.

34
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:09,126
Take the train...
maybe you take your car

35
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:10,760
Now that you can afford it.

36
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:12,928
And who told you that?

37
00:02:12,996 --> 00:02:15,130
Anything?

38
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:17,232
I mean, now's your chance.

39
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:21,637
Well, as I said before,
I'm from the Midwest.

40
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:25,541
We were taught that it's not
polite to talk about yourself.

41
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:33,150
Obviously your glo-coat
floor wax commercials
caused a bit of a squeal,

42
00:02:33,218 --> 00:02:35,052
On the creative side anyway.

43
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,087
What made you think
of this idea?

44
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:40,057
I wanted it to be
indistinguishable
from the movies.

45
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,061
I wanted people to be
watching it and say,

46
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,965
"what's happening
in the story right now?"

47
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,602
Oh, it's something else.

48
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:52,238
"It's not an ad."

49
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,776
At least not for
the first 30 seconds of it.

50
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,945
Very good then.

51
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,848
I think I have all I need.

52
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,182
It's only
a few hundred words,
but on the bright side,

53
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,085
The picture may be
bigger than the article.

54
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:07,088
Oh, uh, you all should meet.

55
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:09,457
This is Jack Hammond
from "advertising age."

56
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,292
Roger sterling
and Pete Campbell.

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,027
I hope we're not
interrupting this crisp

58
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:14,630
And engaging portrait
you're painting.

59
00:03:14,698 --> 00:03:16,498
Ahh...

60
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:18,901
Steady there.

61
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:24,807
- What happened there?
- Korea.

62
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,344
We're grateful
for your sacrifice.

63
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:29,312
- Peter.
- Jack.

64
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,448
Well, it's nice
to meet you all.

65
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:35,117
I'd love to bend your ear
when I finish my book.

66
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:37,019
Certainly.

67
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,654
Don, it was a pleasure.

68
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:40,589
- I look forward to the article.
- We all do.

69
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:49,365
My Uncle lost his leg
hitching a trailer.

70
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:51,968
Used to ask me
to scratch his toes.

71
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:54,603
- He didn't have any.
- We don't have time, Roger.

72
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:56,939
One quick pop, Louise.

73
00:03:57,008 --> 00:03:59,375
All right, where is this party?

74
00:03:59,442 --> 00:04:02,577
- The Sheraton?
- A wooden leg...

75
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:05,748
They're so cheap they can't
even afford a whole reporter.

76
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:12,554
I'm Peter Campbell
and I'm assuming you're Jim.

77
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:15,857
- And this must be Murray.
- Bob... Murray stayed
in Portland.

78
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:18,293
Too bad.
Missing jackhammer season.

79
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:19,694
Roger sterling.

80
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:24,032
- And you must be
Donald draper.
- Don.

81
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,567
Bob.

82
00:04:27,537 --> 00:04:30,071
We're very very excited you
had time to meet with us, don.

83
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,376
Murray told us y&r
had done glo-coat.

84
00:04:34,443 --> 00:04:37,445
Turns out
everybody in New York
except him knows it's you.

85
00:04:37,513 --> 00:04:39,581
And I think they're
a little jealous.

86
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,917
Can't tell who
the client is here.

87
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,120
I know a little,
but what we need to know...

88
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:49,489
What don needs to know is

89
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,723
What exactly is your concern?

90
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,193
I must say I'm getting
tired of saying this today.

91
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,861
Next time just have
one meeting.

92
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,833
We at Jantzen have had
a steady 25% bite
of the apple.

93
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,602
But the two-piece
is most of our concern.

94
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,072
You have a great bikini.
I've spent some time
with the catalogue

95
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,607
And I would say
no concerns at all.

96
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,944
It's not a bikini.

97
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,581
A bikini is underwear
you wear to the beach.

98
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,017
We make a two-piece
bathing suit.

99
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,387
We're a family company.

100
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:22,823
And nowadays it's tough
to make a dent

101
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:25,325
If your ads don't look
like a girlie magazine.

102
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:29,029
Do you want women who want
bikinis to buy your two-piece

103
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:31,698
Or do you just want to make sure
women who want a two-piece

104
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,399
Don't suddenly buy a bikini?

105
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,808
My lord.
That question just tied
a knot in my brain.

106
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,544
Our competitors get bigger

107
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,379
The smaller they make
that swimsuit.

108
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,716
We don't do that.

109
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:52,218
We would like to find a way
without playing in the gutter.

110
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,087
And that's just who
our customers are.

111
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:55,990
Right now.

112
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,927
I love how they sit there
like a couple of choirboys.

113
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:03,431
You know one of them's
leaving New York with v.D.

114
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,067
Where the hell have you been?

115
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:08,969
- What's the problem?
- Don!

116
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:11,538
- Can you give me a minute?
- I don't mind waiting.

117
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,884
- How'd it go?
- Get back to work.

118
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,964
How was your interview?

119
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:40,566
Count to 100 and buzz me.

120
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:48,406
You missed Jeff Atherton.

121
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,608
He came here expressly
to see you.

122
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:54,744
I'm sorry, I didn't know
he was coming and I don't
know who that is.

123
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:58,414
You have no idea how tiny
this place looks to a stranger.

124
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,115
Did you tell him about
the second floor?

125
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:03,417
I refuse to be any part
of that charade.

126
00:07:04,653 --> 00:07:06,587
I wanted an office downtown.

127
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:09,423
We overspent.
We could have got
a lot more for our money.

128
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:11,091
And we could have had
a conference table.

129
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,460
Atherton thought the lack
of a conference table

130
00:07:13,527 --> 00:07:15,962
Was deliberate.
He felt that a...

131
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:20,197
Circle of chairs
demands a conversation.

132
00:07:20,264 --> 00:07:22,233
About why there is no table.

133
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,570
they loved you.

134
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:30,071
What exactly is the problem?

135
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,473
Well, first of all
they're prudes.

136
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:35,276
Second of all
y&r were standing in
the hallway when we left.

137
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:37,278
You've been on
a cattle call before.

138
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:38,945
When the competition was fair.

139
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,680
Every hour of my time
has to be accounted for

140
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:43,582
In the growth of this company.

141
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,917
Get me in a room
where I have a chance.

142
00:07:47,986 --> 00:07:50,956
In the end it's going to come
down to big versus small.

143
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:53,593
There's two firms
Kenyon & Eckhardt,

144
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,827
And D'Arcy.
They'll cancel
each other out.

145
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:58,463
<i>Y&r has six floors
of creative.</i>

146
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:00,732
They can throw bodies
at this account for weeks.

147
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,835
- We don't have
that kind of firepower.
- We don't have to.

148
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:06,406
We're the scrappy upstart.

149
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:08,540
You don't say that
to the clients, do you?

150
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,476
<i>Your accountant is waiting.</i>

151
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:12,411
Send him in.

152
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,981
Creatively, y&r is not capable
of living in this neighborhood.

153
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:18,149
You know why?

154
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:20,986
Because you don't work there.

155
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:30,894
- John.
- Marsha.

156
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,531
- John.
- Marsha.

157
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,401
John!

158
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,538
Happy Thanksgiving.

159
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,807
Oooh, my mother's going
to be over the moon.

160
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,343
Enjoy it.
It's the last thing
we're going to get from them.

161
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:47,678
- What?
- Did you kill sugarberry?

162
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:51,384
- That's a third of my work.
- Stop jumping to conclusions.

163
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:54,052
I guess when Kreutzer
said they were going
to send us all hams

164
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,490
He really meant one
in a cardboard box
with no note.

165
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:58,458
It's about as subtle
as an atomic bomb.

166
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:00,193
Maybe they're cheap.

167
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:02,329
Do you honestly think
this is a good sign?

168
00:09:02,396 --> 00:09:04,297
The work was
old-fashioned.

169
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,132
And whose fault is that?

170
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,402
Well, testing at four
supermarkets in queens,

171
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,971
How much were they
spending? Nothing.

172
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:14,707
If the test was a success,
they would have gone national

173
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,508
And they could be
a big account.

174
00:09:16,576 --> 00:09:18,509
Damn it!

175
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:20,512
I thought we were
getting on a streak.

176
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:24,815
Does this mean I'm down
to two days a week?

177
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:27,752
- Don hated the work.
- Put the ham on his desk.

178
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,523
He's probably having
Thanksgiving dinner
alone in there.

179
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,990
That's not nice.

180
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,159
Marsha!

181
00:09:34,226 --> 00:09:35,795
I'm serious.

182
00:09:38,264 --> 00:09:41,066
Okay, life insurance policy,
it's a company policy.

183
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,336
It pays the company,
not the family.

184
00:09:43,403 --> 00:09:45,170
What do you think?

185
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:48,640
It wouldn't be bad to have
a little security for the kids.

186
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:51,344
According to this,
I'm already a wealthy man.

187
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:53,512
Uncle Sam will take
a healthy bite.

188
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,146
He already has.

189
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,714
And...

190
00:09:56,782 --> 00:09:59,384
The only other issue
is the house.

191
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:00,852
What about it?

192
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,489
Well, October 1st
she was supposed to be out.

193
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:07,892
It seemed so far away
when we agreed to that.

194
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,896
Get her and him out of there
and sell it.

195
00:10:11,964 --> 00:10:15,433
I can call Ben Michaelson
and have him draft a doozy.

196
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:18,302
Start world war III?

197
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,238
You're carrying a mortgage,

198
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:22,374
Plus insurance and taxes

199
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:24,477
For a house you don't live in.

200
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:27,746
Leave it alone.

201
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:32,351
So how are your balls?
Are you enjoying yourself?

202
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,120
Come on.

203
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:37,556
I don't want it like this.
I want it like that.

204
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:40,026
Not too much of that,
just a little like this.

205
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:42,896
And then they look at it
and they don't like it.

206
00:10:42,964 --> 00:10:46,968
Two of their test markets
are in Jewish neighborhoods.
They're idiots.

207
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:50,305
How much does it cost for us
to buy all the product?

208
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:53,175
Too much and we'd have
to do it every day.

209
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:58,381
So how much does it cost
for us to get

210
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:01,350
100 women to line up
at one store, one afternoon,

211
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:03,384
Clean them out once?

212
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:06,121
100 people?
Do you know how big
a line that is?

213
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:07,922
People would talk about it.

214
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,390
- It's a p.R. Stunt.
- We don't do that.

215
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,060
- Why not?
- Because you can't
charge for it.

216
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:15,830
So what?

217
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:19,901
Two women
fighting over one ham,

218
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,737
But they have to really fight.

219
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,738
They have to get arrested
or something.

220
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,274
Because it's the last ham.

221
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:27,710
We don't have to write a play.

222
00:11:27,777 --> 00:11:30,481
It's Thanksgiving.
They're shopping.
The stakes are very high.

223
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:32,448
Old Chuck Dewey could
probably get a story

224
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,551
In the "daily news"
for a case of something.

225
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:37,821
$25 per actress.
We could get Gladys
what's-her-name.

226
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,558
Who's the old lady who never
takes off her mittens?

227
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:43,161
- I don't have any money.
- John!

228
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:44,996
Marsha!

229
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:47,631
I can use my expense account
if I say they're whores.

230
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:49,865
Top-shelf liquor,
what's that gonna run?

231
00:11:49,933 --> 00:11:51,835
Harry gets a case a month

232
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,969
For sticking his nose
up some guy's ass at n.B.C.

233
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:56,505
Should I run it by don?

234
00:11:56,573 --> 00:11:57,874
Really?

235
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:02,744
We'll see.
I'll call casting.

236
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:11,087
Oh, good, I got you
when you're vulnerable.

237
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:18,160
- What do you need?
- Someone white to carve
our Turkey.

238
00:12:18,227 --> 00:12:20,795
I can't, Roger.
I have plans.

239
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,032
You told me that.
Then you told me you had
the kids the day after.

240
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,469
But you never said no
to Jane's friend Bethany.

241
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:30,307
- No.
- I was thinking
the other day

242
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:33,008
About what happens
when you leave here
and it made me very upset.

243
00:12:33,076 --> 00:12:35,110
I could say the same thing.

244
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:37,579
I'll paint you the picture
that's in my mind.

245
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:39,681
But if it's true,
I might kill myself.

246
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:41,851
I've hardly been a monk.

247
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:44,353
Forget that she knows Jane.

248
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,022
This girl's terrific.
She looks like Virginia Mayo.

249
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,792
She's 25, mount Holyoke
gymnastics team.

250
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:52,161
See her this weekend.

251
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,897
You hit it off,
come Turkey day maybe
you can stuff her.

252
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:04,240
Sweetheart,
8:00 Saturday night,

253
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:06,542
Jimmy's la grange
for beauty and the beast.

254
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,879
- Roger.
- They have chicken Kiev.

255
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:11,314
The butter squirts everywhere.

256
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:25,463
- Hello, Mr. Draper.
- Hello, Celia.

257
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,572
I made you some pork chops.
They're good cold too.

258
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,941
I look forward to it.

259
00:13:38,008 --> 00:13:40,642
But you don't eat nothing.

260
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:45,913
- Have you seen my shine Kit?
- I put it on the top
of the closet.

261
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:48,115
<i>- the children coming
this weekend?</i>

262
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:49,883
No.

263
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,121
You need to put things
back where you found them.

264
00:13:53,188 --> 00:13:55,789
I didn't want to leave it
in the middle of the floor.

265
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,505
Okay, good night.
You have a good weekend.

266
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:13,542
And eat something.

267
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:45,402
Let me out of here!

268
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,604
Let me out of here!

269
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,741
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

270
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,945
Footprints on a wet floor...

271
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:59,114
That's no longer
a hanging offense.

272
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:02,116
<i>Glo-coat's
patented formula</i>

273
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,651
<i>Goes on easy
and dries in seconds.</i>

274
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:11,211
So how do you know Jane?

275
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,682
Before you ask me all
the questions, you have
to let me finish one glass.

276
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,618
<i>I don't have to ask you
any questions.</i>

277
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:22,554
I think I'm actually nervous.

278
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:25,123
I haven't done this
since college.

279
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:28,126
Not that it was so long ago,
although it seems like it.

280
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:30,328
I borrowed a dress.

281
00:16:30,396 --> 00:16:33,096
You sat down so fast
I didn't get a good look.

282
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:34,531
Do you want to see it?

283
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:51,681
I can't believe I did that.

284
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:56,052
It's hard to believe
there are two girls
who can wear that.

285
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:00,625
Don, I want to lift
a shadow off this evening.

286
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:03,426
I know this is your first date.

287
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:05,495
First that Roger
was involved in.

288
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:08,064
Oh, of course.
I'm sure. It's just...

289
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:13,303
I'm breaking
a lot of my rules
seeing a divorced man.

290
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:18,073
But Jane has made you
her personal cause.

291
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:23,011
And there are so many
real problems in the world.

292
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:26,180
I know.

293
00:17:26,248 --> 00:17:28,650
The world is so dark right now.

294
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:31,384
The country?

295
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:35,222
My goodness,
you've made me feel very
serious all of a sudden.

296
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,760
I don't know if I can make you
feel better about the world.

297
00:17:39,828 --> 00:17:42,063
One of the boys killed
in Mississippi...

298
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:44,933
Andrew Goodman,
he was from here.

299
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:47,470
A girlfriend of mine
knew him from summer camp.

300
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:51,273
Is that what it takes
to change things?

301
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:56,113
What do you do?

302
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:58,616
I'm an actress.

303
00:17:58,683 --> 00:18:00,951
But right now I'm a super
in the opera.

304
00:18:01,018 --> 00:18:04,389
- And what is that?
- A supernumerary.

305
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:07,024
We're the actors
that fill the stage.

306
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,160
Like the chorus?

307
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:11,095
Mmm, no singing.

308
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:12,830
I do a lot of mock drinking.

309
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:15,267
I'm a wench.
I'm a...

310
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,367
Courtesan.

311
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:20,705
Part of a harem.
It depends on the opera.

312
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:24,308
That is truly fascinating.

313
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:27,580
I love the music.

314
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:30,516
And I love backstage.

315
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,854
Our costumes are as good
as the singers.

316
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:36,122
And I love the stories.

317
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,825
They're very romantic.

318
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:40,727
Have you been?

319
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:42,696
I have.

320
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:46,464
But only for business
so I've never enjoyed it.

321
00:18:46,532 --> 00:18:49,068
Well, then you must
come as my guest.

322
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:54,172
They give the supers tickets
instead of paying
a decent wage.

323
00:18:56,275 --> 00:18:57,875
- Madam?
- Oh, I don't even
need to look.

324
00:18:57,943 --> 00:18:59,577
Chicken Kiev.

325
00:18:59,645 --> 00:19:01,312
They make you wear a bib.

326
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,249
Come on, let's have some fun.

327
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,019
Two chicken Kievs.

328
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:17,966
The barbizon.

329
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,768
I bet that would
make a great opera.

330
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,070
It would.

331
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:24,739
Well, I guess
this is good night.

332
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:27,276
Okay.

333
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,114
Good night.

334
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:36,286
So am I going to see you
at Roger and Jane's
for Thanksgiving?

335
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:40,623
It's tempting, but...

336
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,758
I have plans.

337
00:19:42,826 --> 00:19:46,026
Oh, I'm sure the holidays
must be very complex.

338
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:06,746
It may have been awhile
since you've had to pick up
on messages,

339
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:10,015
But I want to see you again.

340
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,249
How about right now?

341
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:14,418
I stopped the meter.
We can start it again.

342
00:20:14,485 --> 00:20:16,388
It'll be like
I just picked you up.

343
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:18,323
Will you please take a weak no?

344
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:22,627
Let's see where
we are new year's eve.

345
00:20:22,694 --> 00:20:25,764
- If it's meant
to be, it'll keep.
- Let me walk you in.

346
00:20:25,832 --> 00:20:27,600
No.

347
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:29,836
I know that trick.

348
00:20:53,192 --> 00:20:55,793
Waverly and 6th Avenue.

349
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:01,801
I think you both really
acquitted yourselves well.

350
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,038
She doesn't know when to stop.
You don't know when to stop.

351
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:07,774
My objective
was to get the ham.

352
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:09,509
No one told you to hit me.

353
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,478
That wasn't part of it.

354
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:14,814
The important thing is that...
oh, here's Mr. Campbell.

355
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,386
I've been assured you ladies
can look for your names

356
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:23,022
And perhaps your picture
in Monday's "daily news."

357
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,459
- What section?
- It's the "daily news."
it's one big section.

358
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:31,564
All in all,
not a bad way
to spend a Sunday.

359
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:35,968
Can you go back to the market
and get me some aspirin?

360
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:38,837
We probably shouldn't have any
more contact for the time being.

361
00:21:40,707 --> 00:21:42,174
<i>- shall we?</i>

362
00:21:46,878 --> 00:21:48,846
We really appreciate
your talent

363
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:50,848
And of course, your discretion.

364
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:52,448
- You hurt me.
- Ow ow ow!

365
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:54,451
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

366
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,021
- Daisy!
- Walk her to the train.

367
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:01,926
- Are you okay, dear?
- Yeah.

368
00:22:03,561 --> 00:22:05,430
Let's get you in a cab.

369
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,139
- Good morning.
- Welcome back.
How was Los Angeles?

370
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,874
Very hard to leave.

371
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:17,777
I would love a vacation.

372
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:19,580
It wasn't a vacation.

373
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:21,749
I had a lot of tsuris
with Lucy and Desi.

374
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:23,750
Has someone been
using my office?

375
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:25,518
Mr. Sterling doesn't
have a television.

376
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:27,854
I'm calling
a meeting for 11:00.

377
00:22:27,922 --> 00:22:30,157
No, make it 1:00.
Do we have a table yet?

378
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:32,393
1:30 and no.

379
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:36,097
- Hi.
- Yes?

380
00:22:36,164 --> 00:22:38,266
<i>- Do you know where
the seacore rough cut is?
I got it!</i>

381
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:43,571
Don't you want to know why?

382
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:45,807
I sold the jai alai TV special.

383
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:48,043
Really?

384
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,911
A.B.C.
They're moving towards

385
00:22:49,979 --> 00:22:51,981
All these eccentric
sporting events... go-karts.

386
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,350
Well, that's very exciting.

387
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,418
Can you get someone to track
down a cup of coffee for me?

388
00:22:56,486 --> 00:22:58,554
And I'd love
a grapefruit juice.
And, Joan?

389
00:22:58,621 --> 00:23:02,224
- That is my news.
- I won't even tell people
after it's aired.

390
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:08,764
Good morning,
Mr. Draper.

391
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:12,801
Don, can I speak
with you for a minute?

392
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:22,311
Morning.

393
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:24,780
- Lane, would you
excuse us for a minute?
- Of course.

394
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:26,682
Good morning, don.

395
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:34,291
You know,

396
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:36,894
No one who's ever been
associated with an actual event

397
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:39,596
Has thought it's been portrayed
honestly in the newspaper.

398
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:45,903
"Donald draper,
or don as he is known"

399
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,206
Perhaps in an attempt
to appear humble,
is a handsome cipher.

400
00:23:51,209 --> 00:23:53,076
One imagines somewhere
in an attic

401
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:55,345
"There's a painting of him
that's rapidly aging."

402
00:23:56,915 --> 00:23:58,915
For a guy from "ad age"
he can really write.

403
00:23:58,984 --> 00:24:01,519
- He also says you're married.
- Jesus.

404
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:04,422
He never asked me that.
Did he check any facts?

405
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,456
You didn't give him any facts.

406
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:10,161
- He had to make
some assumptions.
- My job is to write ads,

407
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:12,229
Not go around
talking about who I am.

408
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:14,332
Who knows who you are?

409
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,435
This was supposed to be
an advertisement for the firm.

410
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:19,303
Why do you have so many copies?

411
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:21,239
I bought one to read.

412
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:24,076
I was going to buy one
to frame in reception,
and then I read it.

413
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,545
I just wanted
to get them all
before anyone else did.

414
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:28,646
It'll be lining bird cages
by Friday.

415
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:31,083
This is a missed opportunity.

416
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,019
You turned all the sizzle
from glo-coat into a wet fart.

417
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:36,254
Plus you sound like a prick.

418
00:24:36,322 --> 00:24:38,322
Well, it's done.

419
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,294
Stay away from
one-legged reporters.

420
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:45,029
Yeah, I was thinking
about that...

421
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:47,465
Who is he to criticize anybody?

422
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:51,536
Just so you
don't kill yourself,
there was some good news.

423
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:53,537
Jane's friend found
you to be charming.

424
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,372
Although a little
grabby in the car.

425
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,809
That is good news.
Thank you.

426
00:24:57,877 --> 00:25:00,245
She liked you.
Maybe you should have
fondled peg-leg Pete.

427
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:02,347
They raise you up
and they knock you down.

428
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:04,783
I don't know what
I could have done differently.

429
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:07,618
I believe that you were
being modest, but he didn't.

430
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:10,121
I'm sorry, but after
the year you've had,

431
00:25:10,189 --> 00:25:12,056
It's just not
appropriate anymore.

432
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:18,797
He's expecting us!

433
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:22,967
- Is Joey coming?
- I'm here.

434
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:26,137
- Oh.
- Why can't you come
to our office?

435
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:29,406
- Do you want to hear what
sugarberry said or not?
- Shoot.

436
00:25:29,474 --> 00:25:32,776
It was uproarious.
First it's Darryl,
and he tells me about

437
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:36,013
How they stared at
the article all day yesterday
worrying about a lawsuit.

438
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,216
So I hang up and debate
whether or not to tell don...

439
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:40,618
Throw myself on my sword.
And then Kreutzer calls

440
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:42,720
<i>To tell me other papers
picked up the story.</i>

441
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:44,921
<i>And I think,
"he knows it's us,"
but how could he?</i>

442
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,458
And he said everyone,
especially Darryl,
was very excited.

443
00:25:50,896 --> 00:25:53,063
He's sorry someone got hurt,

444
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:55,233
But more people will
taste their ham now

445
00:25:55,301 --> 00:25:57,469
And they'll love it.

446
00:25:57,537 --> 00:26:00,538
It's beautiful.
How do you put something
like this in your book?

447
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:02,406
You can't.
We can't even
charge them.

448
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:03,742
It wouldn't be a bad idea

449
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,744
For them to increase
their media budget.

450
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,245
- Seize the moment.
- With more crappy ads?

451
00:26:08,314 --> 00:26:10,480
- Hopefully not.
- You use it.

452
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:14,318
The winner of
the ham battle is you.

453
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:16,919
Can you imagine?
Lane's dentures would
drop out of his head

454
00:26:16,987 --> 00:26:18,588
If we came in
with an additional buy.

455
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:24,161
"our hams are worth
fighting for."

456
00:26:26,364 --> 00:26:30,668
A cartoon pilgrim and an Indian
in a tug of war with the ham.

457
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:33,537
Old ladies will smile.

458
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:36,406
Why didn't you pitch
that two months ago?
It's good on its own.

459
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:38,508
A slogan's nothing
when you have a good idea.

460
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,145
Black crayon.
I need it in an hour.

461
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:44,047
Chop chop, Joey.

462
00:26:46,317 --> 00:26:48,686
Clara, could you get Darryl
for me at sugarberry?

463
00:26:48,753 --> 00:26:51,721
Tell him it's urgent.
I may need you.

464
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:55,825
<i>Horace cook, Jr.
It's urgent.</i>

465
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,863
Ho-ho!
How was Tijuana?

466
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,233
I have to say,
it's a very flattering
picture.

467
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:06,203
And I don't think
I'd mind being
described that way.

468
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,204
Mr. Crane,
you're a salesman.

469
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:11,074
You do not want to be
known as mysterious.

470
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:13,010
There'll be
no further discussion.

471
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:15,512
I just got off
the phone with ho-ho.

472
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,014
- Jai alai is leaving.
- What?

473
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:21,851
- It's over.
- Bullshit. I just sold
a TV special to a.B.C.

474
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,189
Well, apparently don didn't
mention them in the article.

475
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:29,593
I didn't mention anyone.
That's the reporter's job.

476
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:35,765
- Spectacular.
- What the hell's ho-ho
doing reading "ad age"?

477
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:38,201
- Fix it.
- Todd got all the partners

478
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:41,004
From c.G.C. To call and they
worked him up and down.

479
00:27:41,072 --> 00:27:42,539
They told him
we laugh about him.

480
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,574
I don't!
Get him him on the phone,

481
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,943
Get him in here
or camp out in his driveway.

482
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,813
He hung up on me.

483
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,548
I think he was crying.

484
00:27:54,284 --> 00:27:57,120
How much was left in
ho-ho anyway?

485
00:27:57,186 --> 00:28:00,156
We'll survive with jai alai
off our list.

486
00:28:00,223 --> 00:28:02,491
We will survive,
but for how long?

487
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,059
The loss of jai alai

488
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:07,094
Makes lucky strike
71% of our billings.

489
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,297
It's an untenably
insecure position.

490
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:15,436
Harry, why don't you call
and pretend like you don't
know any of this.

491
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,838
Give it an hour
so he'll take the call.

492
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,474
I wish we really had
a second floor so I could
jump off it.

493
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:32,021
I'm going to have to get
you another interview.

494
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:35,425
"the wall street journal."

495
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:37,360
And what do I do differently?

496
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:39,396
I told him the truth.

497
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:42,199
Who gives a crap
what I say anyway?
My work speaks for me.

498
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:46,036
Turning creative success
into business is your work.

499
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:48,739
And you've failed.

500
00:28:57,115 --> 00:28:59,184
It'll pass.

501
00:29:07,459 --> 00:29:10,328
- Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

502
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:12,097
We started without you.

503
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:14,566
Oh, grandma Pauline,
I told you mother's
was at noon.

504
00:29:14,634 --> 00:29:17,035
- We already ate.
- You're supposed to overeat
on Thanksgiving.

505
00:29:17,104 --> 00:29:19,305
Ooh, thank you.

506
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:21,940
Jamie, you'll have something?

507
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:24,677
We missed dessert.

508
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:27,178
You're next to your father.

509
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:30,214
- Put up some coffee, dear.
- Hi, daddy.

510
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,149
Isn't that sweet?

511
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,053
We didn't forget you.

512
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:40,859
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

513
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:42,594
- Thanks.
- After you eat.

514
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:48,066
The traffic was simply murder.

515
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,769
That's because that's
what's become of this country.

516
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:53,205
Everyone has two
thanksgivings to go to.

517
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:56,641
Maybe we have twice as much
to be thankful for.

518
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:05,216
Don't you like the food, dear?

519
00:30:05,284 --> 00:30:07,952
- No.
- Sally draper, that's rude.

520
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,555
- You love cranberry sauce.
- It has seeds in it.

521
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:14,325
- How about the sweet potato?
- I'm not hungry.

522
00:30:14,392 --> 00:30:17,694
Look, there's marshmallow.

523
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,867
oh lord.

524
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:30,240
She might have a fever.

525
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:32,608
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, dear.

526
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:36,413
<i>- Isabel, can you bring a rag?
Ow, stop pinching me!</i>

527
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,087
I love sweet potatoes.

528
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:52,060
<i>- Isabel!</i>

529
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:55,963
Happy Thanksgiving.

530
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:05,507
- Do you want a drink?
- I don't have much time.

531
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:07,743
- I have supper
with my family.
- Oh.

532
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:10,747
- Of course you do.
- Should I not have
mentioned my family?

533
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:12,748
I never know how
you're going to react.

534
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:14,684
No, that's fine.

535
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:28,498
- Let me take off my brassiere.
- No. In a minute.

536
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:31,134
Stop telling me what to do.
I know what you want.

537
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:33,736
So do it.

538
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,574
Harder.

539
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:42,244
Again.

540
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:57,561
Hold on.

541
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,635
Surprise, it's for you.

542
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,474
Why did you answer it?

543
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:12,543
It was the third try.
I couldn't take it.

544
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:19,315
- Hello?
- Happy Thanksgiving.

545
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:21,485
Happy Thanksgiving.

546
00:32:21,553 --> 00:32:24,488
I'm sorry to bother you.
I didn't know you'd have guests.

547
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:26,723
What's wrong?

548
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:30,026
I need $280 for bail.

549
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,895
Bye.

550
00:32:32,963 --> 00:32:36,098
- Where are you?
- It... it's not for me.

551
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:42,971
Spit it out, honey.

552
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:45,907
You're going to laugh.

553
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:49,475
Pete and I hired some actresses

554
00:32:49,543 --> 00:32:52,679
To get in a fight
over a sugarberry ham.

555
00:32:52,746 --> 00:32:54,913
<i>You know, as a stunt.</i>

556
00:32:54,982 --> 00:32:57,316
We got them to increase
their media budget.

557
00:32:58,885 --> 00:33:00,519
Hello?

558
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:02,488
I'm here.

559
00:33:02,557 --> 00:33:05,525
Well, one of them pressed
charges against the other

560
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:07,660
For assault.
It's $80 bail

561
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:09,962
And $100 apiece to keep
their mouths shut.

562
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,532
And it has to happen today.

563
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,500
Call Pete!

564
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:17,805
Do you think
you're my first call?

565
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,111
Hello.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

566
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,480
- I oughta let you
Twist in the wind.
- It still worked out.

567
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,016
- You'll be very happy.
- I'm not happy.

568
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,318
And I don't think
it's funny or cute.

569
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,387
You run something
like that by me first.

570
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:35,556
I would have kept you
from looking like an idiot,

571
00:33:35,624 --> 00:33:37,724
Or worse yet,
making me look like one.
Is that what you want?

572
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:41,094
You want people to think
we're idiots, Peggy?

573
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:43,796
Hey, there's no reason
for name-calling.

574
00:33:43,864 --> 00:33:46,632
- She's been agonizing.
- Who are you?

575
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,901
I'm her fiance.

576
00:33:48,969 --> 00:33:51,303
Mark, don't.

577
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:54,374
Why'd you bring him
up here if you didn't
want him involved?

578
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,210
I know.
I'm sorry, don.

579
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,384
- Fiance?
- It just came out.

580
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,996
- Did you put the dog out?
- It's cold outside.

581
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:16,765
But I locked her
in the laundry room.

582
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,106
It's not cold in here.

583
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,554
Sally.

584
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,457
I was calling daddy.

585
00:34:44,526 --> 00:34:47,095
Hello?

586
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:49,465
I wanted to wish him
a happy Thanksgiving.

587
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:51,767
You'll see him tomorrow.

588
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:54,104
You want to call him
to complain about
how awful I am?

589
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,773
Don't expect any sympathy when
he hears my side of the story.

590
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:59,608
- Don't!
- Go to bed.

591
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:09,518
I'm going to have them take
that phone out of the hallway.

592
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:11,153
Mmm.

593
00:35:18,728 --> 00:35:20,963
Tomorrow when the kids go,

594
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:24,167
Why don't we have Carla
take the baby and we'll
drive to a nice dinner?

595
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:28,004
Maybe Essex.

596
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:29,805
The Griswold inn.

597
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:33,477
Okay.

598
00:35:38,047 --> 00:35:39,748
I'm really full, Betty.

599
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:51,041
Daddy!

600
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:52,977
- Oooh!
- Dad.

601
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:58,516
- How much Turkey did you eat?
- I ate everything.

602
00:35:58,584 --> 00:36:01,619
hello, daddy.

603
00:36:01,687 --> 00:36:03,588
Hello.

604
00:36:07,094 --> 00:36:09,596
- 9:00 tomorrow night.
- Where's the baby?

605
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:12,132
I had Carla take him.
You weren't going to.

606
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,534
- Henry and I have plans.
- I'd like to see him.

607
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:19,239
- Hello, don.
- Henry.

608
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:22,108
Come on, let's go.

609
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:41,628
Garage door.

610
00:36:46,534 --> 00:36:50,103
- What are you doing?
- You know what I'm doing.

611
00:36:58,244 --> 00:37:01,613
The button fell off my pajamas.

612
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,480
I'll sew it on in the morning.

613
00:37:03,548 --> 00:37:05,149
You know how to sew?

614
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:07,451
I can do a button.
I'll show you.

615
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,192
I'll leave the light on
in the bathroom

616
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,095
So there won't be
any more problems, okay?

617
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:19,731
- Okay.
- Good night, daddy.

618
00:37:21,902 --> 00:37:23,737
Good night,

619
00:37:23,804 --> 00:37:25,672
Both of you.

620
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,383
do you have your key?

621
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:28,669
- Hello?
- Maybe they're asleep.

622
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:32,172
go upstairs.

623
00:38:58,234 --> 00:39:00,335
Let go!

624
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:07,241
<i>What the hell is the dog
doing in the house?</i>

625
00:39:08,842 --> 00:39:10,476
You run up to bed.
I'll wait.

626
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:12,580
For what?

627
00:39:12,648 --> 00:39:14,615
Oh.

628
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:16,984
It's almost 10:00.

629
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:19,820
- I thought you said 10:00.
- She didn't.

630
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:21,522
I've waited for you
plenty of times.

631
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,458
Henry, do you mind?

632
00:39:24,526 --> 00:39:27,595
- Betty?
- It's okay.

633
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:29,465
Does that mean I should stay
or not stay?

634
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:30,799
Stay.

635
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,871
When are you moving out?

636
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:38,874
I don't know.

637
00:39:38,941 --> 00:39:40,442
You were supposed
to be out a month ago.

638
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,446
We haven't found the right
place for the kids.

639
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,749
Well, either do as we agreed
or I'm going to need
to collect rent.

640
00:39:46,817 --> 00:39:50,019
- What?
- Or you could just buy it
from me if you want to.

641
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,888
I can't believe you.

642
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:54,491
Don, it's temporary.

643
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:58,060
Believe me, Henry,
everybody thinks this
is temporary.

644
00:39:58,128 --> 00:40:00,395
Good night.

645
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:08,069
He has some nerve.

646
00:40:08,136 --> 00:40:10,571
I know you don't want
to hear this,

647
00:40:10,638 --> 00:40:13,107
But he's right.

648
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:16,109
Haven't the kids been
through enough change
already?

649
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:18,845
I can't just uproot them
with no place to go.

650
00:40:18,912 --> 00:40:21,313
You're not even looking.

651
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,782
There's nothing out there,
and he doesn't decide.

652
00:40:34,426 --> 00:40:36,828
<i>- miss Olson is here
to see you.</i>

653
00:40:42,035 --> 00:40:43,936
Send her in.

654
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:51,278
They sent one for each of us.

655
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:55,749
Could have just as easily
fired us.

656
00:40:55,817 --> 00:40:58,986
But they didn't
because they sold
more hams.

657
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:02,024
And now you get
to tell them why,
if you want.

658
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:03,358
I think they'll be impressed.

659
00:41:05,394 --> 00:41:06,494
Well, I'm not.

660
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,900
I try and stay away from
these kinds of shenanigans.

661
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,269
But I guess you knew that
or you would have told me.

662
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:16,905
It was going great
until it wasn't.

663
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:19,307
Thanks for the ham.

664
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:22,743
I should have told you.

665
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,081
Since when do you
have a fiance?

666
00:41:27,149 --> 00:41:29,050
I don't.

667
00:41:31,019 --> 00:41:33,387
But you didn't have
to do that that way.

668
00:41:33,454 --> 00:41:36,357
You brought him with you
because you thought I
wouldn't embarrass you.

669
00:41:36,425 --> 00:41:38,193
At least I'm thinking ahead.

670
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:40,829
Doesn't always work, does it?

671
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:46,602
You need to think
a little bit more about
the image of this agency.

672
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,405
Well, nobody knows
about the ham stunt,

673
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:53,311
So our image remains
pretty much where
you left it.

674
00:41:53,379 --> 00:41:56,580
I won't need you in
the Jantzen presentation.

675
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:59,449
- Now you're being spiteful.
- No.

676
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,086
I just think it would
be better not to have
a girl in the room.

677
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,657
You know something?

678
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,559
We are all here because of you.

679
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,731
All we want to do
is please you.

680
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,239
Why don't I put them
in the pantry?

681
00:42:25,307 --> 00:42:27,141
Christmas is around the corner.

682
00:42:27,209 --> 00:42:30,344
<i>Put them in the basement.</i>

683
00:42:30,412 --> 00:42:32,907
Did the children
like their gifts?

684
00:42:32,975 --> 00:42:34,575
They did.

685
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:40,915
It's nice the holiday is
memorable in some other way.

686
00:42:40,983 --> 00:42:44,085
I'm sorry a little girl
spoiled your Thanksgiving.

687
00:42:44,858 --> 00:42:46,258
Next time I'll tell her
not to get sick.

688
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:48,411
I've raised children
in my life, Henry.

689
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:50,780
They're terrified of her.

690
00:42:50,848 --> 00:42:53,181
You don't know
any of the people
you're talking about.

691
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:55,184
Well, I know
what you see in her.

692
00:42:55,252 --> 00:42:58,121
And you could have gotten it
without marrying.

693
00:42:58,188 --> 00:43:00,690
Why can't you
give her a chance?

694
00:43:00,756 --> 00:43:04,460
- She loves you.
- She's a silly woman.

695
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:06,661
Honestly, Henry,

696
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:09,265
I don't know how you can stand
living in that man's dirt.

697
00:43:18,207 --> 00:43:20,475
<i>You go to the swimming pool,
you go to the beach,</i>

698
00:43:20,543 --> 00:43:22,811
<i>Take off your robe,
you head into the cabana.</i>

699
00:43:22,879 --> 00:43:27,021
<i>There's no other way
to slice it, you're
getting undressed.</i>

700
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:28,765
Can I put my feet on this?

701
00:43:29,057 --> 00:43:30,178
- Pretend like
it's your living room.
- Thank you.

702
00:43:31,747 --> 00:43:35,082
What separates a bathing suit
from underwear?

703
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:37,619
The cut and the print
of the cloth

704
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:40,135
and some sort of
gentlemen's agreement.

705
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:48,217
"so well built,

706
00:43:48,284 --> 00:43:50,453
We can't show you
the second floor."

707
00:43:59,196 --> 00:44:01,796
I think that's
a little suggestive.

708
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:04,500
Good. That's what
I was going for.

709
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:06,835
A wink, but it's not a leer.

710
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:09,371
We don't want a wink.

711
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,908
I think I explained
our product is for
modest people.

712
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:15,710
Modest people want
to be stimulated too.

713
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,546
This draws them in in a way

714
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,048
That will make your competitors
seem crude and obvious.

715
00:44:20,437 --> 00:44:22,300
Plus they'll be dying
to see the suit.

716
00:44:22,477 --> 00:44:23,731
They'll be dying
to see the girl.

717
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:26,868
And for all we know
she's not even wearing a top.

718
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,611
You'll get them into the store.

719
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:30,724
Isn't that the point?

720
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,292
It's not wholesome.

721
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:37,323
It's not...
did I tell you we're
a family company?

722
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,812
I think I know what
you're looking for.

723
00:44:39,378 --> 00:44:41,846
A couple of women
bouncing a beach ball,

724
00:44:41,914 --> 00:44:44,048
Little girl in front of them
building a sandcastle.

725
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:48,152
Your competitors are
gonna keep killing you

726
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,154
Because you're too scared
of the skin

727
00:44:50,222 --> 00:44:52,890
That your two-piece
was designed to show off.

728
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:56,427
Well, it's somehow dirtier

729
00:44:56,495 --> 00:44:58,996
Not seeing anything.

730
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,565
You need to decide what kind
of company you want to be...

731
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:05,569
Comfortable and dead
or risky and possibly rich.

732
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:07,804
All I know is
we don't want that.

733
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:12,877
Well, gentlemen,
you were wondering what
a creative agency looks like,

734
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:15,012
There you have it.

735
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,647
Hope you enjoyed
looking in the window.

736
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,650
Give me a minute.

737
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,388
Where are you going?

738
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:26,624
Control yourself.

739
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:28,926
Now cool off.

740
00:45:28,994 --> 00:45:32,329
Hopefully Campbell can talk
them into hearing a few more
ideas in a week or so.

741
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,131
What?
No.

742
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,967
That's not the point.

743
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,437
Out.
Get out.

744
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:40,904
- Don.
- Excuse me?

745
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:43,239
Get your things and get out
of my office now.

746
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,577
Come on, let's go.

747
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:57,354
Call Bert Cooper's man
at "the wall street journal."

748
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,930
There's always a name
in every partnership

749
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,732
That defines who they are.

750
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,001
In the case of sterling
Cooper draper Pryce

751
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,003
Would you say
that's Donald draper?

752
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,739
Yes.

753
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,941
Really?

754
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:21,277
Last year our agency
was being swallowed whole.

755
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,747
I realized I had two choices.

756
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,550
I could die of boredom

757
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,451
Or holster up my guns.

758
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:33,056
So I walked into lane Pryce's
office and I said,

759
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,858
"fire us."

760
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:41,898
Two days later
we were operating out
of the Pierre hotel.

761
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,435
Within a year we had
taken over two floors
of the time-life building.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
