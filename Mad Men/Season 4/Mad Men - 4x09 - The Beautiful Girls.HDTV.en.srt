<i>Previously on
AMC's Mad Men...</i>

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:04,407
Sally needs to see
a psychiatrist.

3
00:00:04,584 --> 00:00:05,809
Why? Because she
couldn't hear.

4
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:08,513
She's out of control.
I thought you'd be concerned.

5
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:11,344
You've crossed the border
from lubricated to morose.

6
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:13,809
Ken has accounts.

7
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:16,640
Fillmore Auto Parts because
entered the Nation arena.

8
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,632
Abe.
Are you with Joyce?

9
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:19,592
Are you?

10
00:00:19,817 --> 00:00:21,857
It's basic training.
I'll be back.

11
00:00:21,992 --> 00:00:24,656
What am I gonna do?
Who I'm gonna talk to?

12
00:00:24,777 --> 00:00:26,119
I'm just gonna take
you to your door.

13
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,167
Why is that?

14
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:29,744
Because that's as far as
I can go right now.

16
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,330
I'm interested in today.
That was Friday.

17
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:14,200
Look, I'll clear lunch
plus one hour

18
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:16,503
And we'll grab a sandwich
and discuss this face to face.

19
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,872
I'm hanging up.

20
00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:37,524
Is it broken?

21
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:41,060
The lamp?

22
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:45,498
What are you doing
all the way
over there?

23
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:47,033
It's too hot.

24
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:49,569
Would you settle for a leg?

25
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:51,171
I'd be grateful.

26
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,308
It's cold

27
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,343
And soft.

28
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:59,312
I'm the softest.

29
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:15,695
So which one of us
is gonna look at
the clock first?

30
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,601
I caught it when I was
picking up the lamp.

31
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:23,469
I'm already late.

32
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:25,471
For what?

33
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,440
Secor laxatives.

34
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,578
Did I spoil the mood?

35
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:33,680
What do you have to do?

36
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:37,283
I have a 4:00
at Erwin Wasey.

37
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,385
Doing what?

38
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,321
I can't tell you that,
Mr. Bond.

39
00:02:41,388 --> 00:02:43,790
I told you.

40
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:46,226
What are you working on
over there?

41
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:47,961
I don't tell 'em
what I'm doing for you.

42
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:52,165
You're not lying
in bed with them
right now either.

43
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:55,568
Do you know what
a Chinese wall is?

44
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:01,140
I really should go.

45
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,079
Can I get in
the bathroom first?

46
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:08,214
Just take your time.

47
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:16,055
Let yourself out.

48
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:19,525
Lock the door behind you
as a courtesy.

49
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:21,761
You wanna leave me here?

50
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,997
You sure?

51
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:28,101
I'm taking everything
interesting with me.

52
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:38,244
I don't understand.
Do you honestly think

53
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:39,512
My book isn't better
than Ogilvy's?

54
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,180
Mine's got a story.

55
00:03:41,248 --> 00:03:44,117
It's got mystery,
intrigue, romance.

56
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:45,818
I tell you It's got examples

57
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:47,720
<i>- Of how to sell things.</i>

58
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:49,589
Hold on.

59
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,859
I'm on the phone.

60
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:54,761
<i>It's Mrs. Sterling.</i>

61
00:03:54,828 --> 00:03:56,663
<i>She's leaving
for the weekend.</i>

62
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,300
It's only Wednesday.
They have phones in
Southampton.

63
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,069
Ira, I don't want
to sound ungrateful.
I just think...

64
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:05,605
Hello?
Hello?

65
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:07,674
Shit.

66
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:11,411
Come in.

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,448
These need signatures,
not initials.

68
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,418
<i>Caroline said
you refused?</i>

69
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:19,952
It's just so much more work.

70
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:24,857
I was just giving her
a hard time.

71
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:28,061
Can I interest you in the same?

72
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,563
<i>And I'm supposed
to tell you in person</i>

73
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:31,931
That Mr. Pryce
will be taking off

74
00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:33,933
The last two weeks
of August for his son's visit.

75
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,002
You had to tell me that
in person?

76
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,339
- So depressing.
- He doesn't want
a memo circulating.

77
00:04:39,406 --> 00:04:41,240
He's afraid people
will stop working.

78
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:43,543
What are you doing in August?

79
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,478
I'm not sure.

80
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:48,448
Well, what are you doing
this afternoon?

81
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:51,351
The same thing I do
every afternoon... working...

82
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:53,820
Which is what I'm trying
to do right now.

83
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,388
It's not cute.

84
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:58,591
Joanie.

85
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,560
Jesus.
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,995
What did you say to her?

87
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:04,397
What does that have
to do with you?

88
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:08,101
Her husband got called up.

89
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:10,136
He's going to Vietnam
right after basic.

90
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:12,171
Vietnam.

91
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,407
That's not good.

92
00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:17,110
It's okay.
We've all been
walking on eggshells.

93
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:24,784
Good afternoon, all.

94
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:26,786
I know you don't like
to be bombarded

95
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:28,354
The moment you walk in,
but Fillmore and secor

96
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:29,822
Are both coming in tomorrow.

97
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,290
I can't move forward
with either until you sign off

98
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:32,992
On what I worked
through lunch to finish.

99
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,795
I'm sorry.
I had a long lunch,
went for a swim.

100
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,630
Come back in an hour.
I'm taking a nap.

101
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:44,670
It's a business of sadists
and masochists,

102
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:46,472
And you know which one you are.

103
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:54,414
- Oh hi.
- Peggy, your
boyfriend's here.

104
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:57,350
Satisfaction guaranteed.

105
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,285
- Why are you here?
- Thought we could
get a drink,

106
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:00,787
- Shoot the bull.
- Sure.

107
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:02,822
- What time? Where?
- ♪ when you're alone ♪

108
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,057
♪ and life
is making you lonely ♪

109
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,428
- ♪ you can always go... ♪
- 7:00, p.J. Clarke's.

110
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,363
♪ midtown ♪

111
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,331
I'll meet you in the lobby.

112
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,667
Ooh, down below.

113
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:16,369
Give it a break, jughead.

114
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:20,840
Oh, I'm not shocked
by your lesbian hijinks.

115
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:23,309
I just hope you know
you can never do

116
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:25,077
What a man can do.

117
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:27,880
That's true.

118
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:37,890
Bad news.
Don showed up.
We're on at 4:00.

119
00:06:42,863 --> 00:06:45,364
<i>How was your siesta?
Are you refreshed?</i>

120
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:48,534
- Yes.
- Dr. Miller
returned your call.

121
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:50,069
She said not to wake you

122
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:51,904
And you needn't return.

123
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:54,407
But she got the message
and you're gonna
have to wait.

124
00:06:57,277 --> 00:06:59,679
- Thank you.
- Are you going
to the toilet?

125
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,716
<i>- I have to hire
more copywriters,</i>

126
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:05,618
But these men come in
and I know

127
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,954
The better they are,
the more my job
is in danger.

128
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:10,756
Oh my.

129
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:15,628
Look who's here... Abe.

130
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:19,031
Peggy, I don't know
if you remember Abe Drexler
from Kellogg's loft party.

131
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:21,834
- Hi, I'm Peggy.
- I remember.

132
00:07:21,902 --> 00:07:24,403
Abe, you want to
join us for a drink?

133
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,639
Yes, please do.

134
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,307
Oh, stay.
I'll just stand here.

135
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,344
Can I get a Johnny Walker
with ice?

136
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,813
Ah, he didn't hear me.

137
00:07:36,049 --> 00:07:37,550
You know what?
I'm gonna go play darts.

138
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:39,452
- Take my seat.
- Are you sure?

139
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,088
Pay for that.
See you kids later.

140
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:49,529
I'm sorry.
She's...

141
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:51,564
Always so damn
self-amused.

142
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:53,933
What are you talking about?

143
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:57,537
I was gonna stop by
your office, but I didn't
want to get you in trouble.

144
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:00,373
Then I thought about
finding out where you live,
but that's weird.

145
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,875
So anyway

146
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:06,345
- It's nice running into you.
- I don't know what to say.

147
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:09,282
That's very flattering.

148
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,183
Well, that's how I meant it.

149
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:17,456
Johnny Walker.
Rocks.

150
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:19,725
The bartender here
listens to me.

151
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:36,409
- May I help you?
- Are you Joan Harris?

152
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:40,046
- I am.
- We're from madam Inga's.

153
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:44,050
You are to receive massage,
manicure and pedicure.

154
00:08:44,117 --> 00:08:47,687
- Can we?
- I didn't order this.

155
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:50,823
It's a gift
from a friend,
tip included.

156
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:54,694
- What friend?
- I'm not allowed
to say this.

157
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:05,972
In Greece right now?
Make no mistake,

158
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,608
That's a revolution.
We are a hair away

159
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:11,644
From everything falling apart
in every society.
It's so tenuous.

160
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,146
All these corporations
just throw their money
at everyone

161
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:16,549
To keep the status quo intact
'cause the people
outnumber them.

162
00:09:16,617 --> 00:09:20,519
But in the blink
of an eye, they could
overturn everything.

163
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:23,122
It's an illusion
that America's so organized

164
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,624
That it could never happen
over here.

165
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:31,297
- Are you from Brooklyn?
- I am.

166
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:33,199
- Me too.
- I don't hear it.

167
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:35,201
One more drink
and it'll come out.

168
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:37,970
Okay.

169
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:42,675
What am I talking to you
about corporations for?

170
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,511
- You must deal with them
all the time.
- I guess.

171
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,847
Vick chemical,
American tobacco,

172
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:49,949
But most of them
are family businesses...

173
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,518
Samsonite, Fillmore auto parts,

174
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:55,321
- Sugarberry...
- Fillmore auto parts
is worse than a corporation,

175
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,356
- What with
the boycott and all.
- What boycott?

176
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,592
The Southern stores
won't hire Negroes.

177
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,894
Says who?

178
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:04,130
It was in "the voice."
it was in a couple
of places.

179
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,932
I don't think that's true.
I would've heard that.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,701
It is true.

181
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:11,404
That doesn't seem like them.

182
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:14,707
I'm sure
they're perfectly nice
for racists, you know,

183
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:18,110
And obviously your
company has an investment
in looking the other way.

184
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,515
Well, it's a complicated idea,

185
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:24,750
But in advertising,

186
00:10:24,818 --> 00:10:26,452
We don't really judge people.

187
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,387
We try and help them
out of these situations.

188
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:30,856
Certainly we would try
and stop this.

189
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,925
If it's true,
it's not good
for their business.

190
00:10:32,993 --> 00:10:35,795
Jesus, I don't even know
where to start.

191
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:37,830
You would've done
a campaign for Goldwater?

192
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:40,232
You kidding?
That would've
been spectacular.

193
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,235
- Did you vote for him?
- Of course not.

194
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,337
Wha... civil rights
isn't a situation

195
00:10:45,405 --> 00:10:47,907
To be fixed
with some ##p.R. Campaign.

196
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:50,576
It's an inequality
that the world has
its eyes on.

197
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,344
I know.

198
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:56,582
But I have to say

199
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,651
Most of the things
Negroes can't do

200
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,486
I can't do either

201
00:11:00,554 --> 00:11:02,455
And nobody seems to care.

202
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:04,390
What are you talking about?

203
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,692
Half of the meetings
take place over golf,
tennis,

204
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,829
In a bunch of clubs
where I'm not allowed
to be a member

205
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:11,731
Or even enter.

206
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,667
The university club said
the only way I could
eat dinner there

207
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:15,835
Was if I arrived in a cake.

208
00:11:15,902 --> 00:11:18,904
There's no Negro
copywriters, you know.

209
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,440
I'm sure they could
fight their way in
like I did.

210
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:24,043
Believe me,
nobody wanted me there.

211
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:26,779
All right, Peggy.

212
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,314
We'll have a civil rights
March for women.

213
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,021
I have a really early day.

214
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:37,389
It was nice to see you.

215
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,625
Wait. Hey hey hey.
I'm just saying

216
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:41,927
They're not shooting women
to keep 'em from voting.
That's all.

217
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,664
Oh, Jesus.
I'm really sorry.

218
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:47,867
I'm much better on paper.

219
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:51,470
You're opinionated
and you're criticizing me.

220
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,305
That's not what I'm doing.
This is discourse.

221
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:55,975
I knew I shouldn't
have let Joyce leave.

222
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,977
Have a good night.

223
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,375
A three-letter word
for a flightless bird.

224
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:11,010
Emu.

225
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,778
Nope. It starts
with an "l."

226
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:14,547
The hell it does.

227
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,917
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

228
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,885
Could I get some coffee?
And let me know when
Dr. Miller arrives.

229
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,588
It's hard... the way
she breezes past me.

230
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:30,629
She's pushy, that one.

231
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,698
I guess that's what it takes.

232
00:12:35,502 --> 00:12:37,403
- Morning.
- Good morning.

233
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,839
- And thank you.
- For what?

234
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,674
That was very thoughtful.

235
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:44,844
I knew I was rubbing you
the wrong way,

236
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:48,214
So I thought,
why not have someone
rub you the right way?

237
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:51,283
- I brought you bear claws.
- Caroline won't let me
have one

238
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,252
Unless it's on the end
of a real bear.

239
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,522
- Well, anyway.
- Joanie.

240
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:01,193
- It'll be okay.
- People love to say that.

241
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,996
Look, I know you're
having a tough run.

242
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:07,600
Let me get you a meal, Hmm?

243
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,201
Take your mind off things?

244
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:11,404
Of course.

245
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,941
I forgot for a second
that you're incapable
of doing something nice

246
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,877
Without expecting
something nicer
in return.

247
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,712
I didn't mean anything by it.

248
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,414
Honest.

249
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:23,115
Just thought you
could use a night out.

250
00:13:23,183 --> 00:13:25,785
- Thank you.
I'm fine.
- Good.

251
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:37,329
- What are you doing here?
- I wrote something.

252
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,231
I kind of wrote it for you.

253
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:42,601
I would love it if you read it.

254
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:46,906
"Nuremberg on Madison avenue"?

255
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,911
- What is this?
- It's what I was
trying to say last night,

256
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:54,380
But without,
I don't know,
my abrasive tone.

257
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,749
- Read it.
- Right now
in front of you?

258
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:59,118
Nah. Take your time.
I'll wait over here.

259
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:01,620
I have a lot to do.

260
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:03,989
I came all the way up here.
I want to know what
you think, okay?

261
00:14:11,298 --> 00:14:13,365
These domesticated suburbanites

262
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,868
Still have
a primitive desire
to get their hands dirty,

263
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:19,405
But have they have become
so removed from nature
that they can't.

264
00:14:19,473 --> 00:14:21,373
They don't know
how to hunt or swing
a hammer

265
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:23,709
- Or fix their cars.
- You mean like these two.

266
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,912
Actually, no.
I'm from Vermont

267
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,982
And Don's a competitive
fly fisherman.

268
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,185
What our findings show
is that this demographic

269
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,321
Will spend
a good amount of money

270
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,289
For the satisfaction
of being useful with
their hands.

271
00:14:37,357 --> 00:14:40,659
Ladies love a man
who's good with his hands.

272
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,096
You think a mechanic
comes in and sees
these jokers

273
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,798
Looking at fan belts,
he's gonna stick around?

274
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,102
- No offense.
- What's the difference?

275
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,470
Our inventory's the same.

276
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:53,772
I think if they see
a coat and tie on aisle 4,

277
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,342
They'll think
our prices went up.
I know I would.

278
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:59,745
Listen, salt of the earth,
we need more than mechanics
to survive.

279
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:01,747
<i>You ever hear of sears?
They'll kill us.</i>

280
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:03,582
We agreed we all had to agree.

281
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,618
Don't we have enough problems
with the boycott?

282
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,854
Look, I don't want
to get involved

283
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:10,990
In a family squabble,
but I can't move forward

284
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,491
Until you agree on a strategy.

285
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:16,395
What if there were a way
to market to both groups?

286
00:15:16,463 --> 00:15:18,464
"Fillmore auto parts.

287
00:15:18,532 --> 00:15:21,367
Where the pros go
and everyone's welcome."

288
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:24,670
- It's a little corny.
- It's great and you know it.

289
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:27,206
That's not a strategy.
That's two strategies

290
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:28,474
Connected by
the word "and."

291
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,509
I can do "where the pros go"

292
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:32,545
Or I can do
"everyone's welcome,"

293
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:34,880
- But not both.
- Sure you can.

294
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,422
Someone has
to make a decision.
There are three of you.

295
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,858
Vote.

296
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:47,159
Sean, what do you think?

297
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:50,162
I d-d-d-d...

298
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,832
D-d-d-don't know.

299
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,367
<i>What?</i>

300
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:57,336
You'll have to excuse me
for a moment.

301
00:15:57,404 --> 00:15:59,238
Continue, please.

302
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:06,345
Why d-d-do we

303
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,080
Have to c-c-convince him?

304
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,017
What are you doing here?

305
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:16,722
I wanted to see you.

306
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,091
I am so sorry.
Who are you?

307
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,660
My name is Vivian winters

308
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:23,696
And I'm going to assume
you're her father

309
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:25,264
Since that's what
she's led me to believe.

310
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,266
Don. What exactly
is going on?

311
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:29,602
I found her on the train
between carriages

312
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,637
Trying to avoid the conductor.

313
00:16:31,705 --> 00:16:33,772
I didn't have enough money.

314
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,109
Megan, could you take her
to my office?

315
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:39,411
Go.

316
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:46,318
Thank you.

317
00:16:46,386 --> 00:16:48,087
Can I pay you
for the ticket
and your time?

318
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,055
You're just very lucky
I ran into her

319
00:16:50,123 --> 00:16:51,890
Before someone else did.

320
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:54,827
The types on that train?
Someone should keep
track of her.

321
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,196
You're right.
I didn't know.

322
00:16:57,264 --> 00:17:00,032
Men never know what's going on.

323
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,235
- I offered you money
and I said thank you.

324
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:12,444
She looks so chubby
in the pictures.

325
00:17:12,512 --> 00:17:14,113
Get her mother
on the phone now.

326
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,754
What do you think you're doing?

327
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:25,090
I wanted to see you
and I didn't want to
wait two weekends.

328
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:29,161
Well, you can't do this.
This is very serious.

329
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:31,230
<i>Mrs. Francis
on the line.</i>

330
00:17:34,434 --> 00:17:37,636
- Guess who's sitting
on my couch right now.
- What are you talking about?

331
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:40,606
I'm talking about a stranger
bringing Sally to my office

332
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,108
<i>- Because she got on
the train with no money.
- You're kidding.</i>

333
00:17:43,176 --> 00:17:45,210
Carla was
supposed to pick her up
after the doctor.

334
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,280
- How the hell did this happen?
- Dr. Keener thought it would
be good for her

335
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:50,316
To walk from camp to her
appointment by herself.

336
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:52,851
Great idea.
Thank you, psychiatry.

337
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,554
Don't yell at me.
She needs to learn
responsibility.

338
00:17:55,622 --> 00:17:57,756
<i>You need to learn
responsibility.</i>

339
00:17:57,824 --> 00:17:59,692
Now come get her.
I've got a business
to run here.

340
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,695
Because it's so easy.
It's so much fun to
take care of her.

341
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,296
Enjoy.

342
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,365
- What?
- Enjoy, don.

343
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,901
I'm meeting Henry in
the city tomorrow night.
I'll get her then.

344
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:17,009
Don't move
and don't touch anything.

345
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:22,247
I don't want to hear it.
Just make sure she doesn't
leave that room.

346
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:36,880
- Hey.
Are you serious with this?

347
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:44,688
Everyone knows
who represents
Fillmore auto parts.

348
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:47,324
- We're the agency of record.
- But I was defending you.

349
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:49,392
We have a religion
in this country

350
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,261
And it's business.
You're not a priest.

351
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,362
You're just another congregant.

352
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,230
So I'm not a war criminal.

353
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:57,133
Look, why should
someone nice like you
have to do this?

354
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:58,868
Why should you be a part
of that corruption?

355
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:01,438
It's a waste of your
and a million other
artists' gifts.

356
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,740
If you publish this,
I'll lose my job.

357
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:05,141
Maybe you're better than this.

358
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:08,578
I'm not a political person.

359
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,447
I don't have to defend myself.

360
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,317
You're political whether
you like it or not.

361
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:17,187
And you're not supposed
to be insulted.

362
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:19,489
- You're supposed
to be flattered.
- Are you crazy?

363
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:23,026
You inspired me.
I wrote this for you.

364
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,161
I guess I read you wrong.

365
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:29,466
You look so earnest.

366
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,768
I need your word that
you'll destroy that.

367
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:34,004
Sure.

368
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:36,172
I won't bother you again.

369
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,651
Miss Blankenship.

370
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:55,158
Miss Blankenship,
are you all right?

371
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,963
Miss Blankenship.

372
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,099
Miss Blankenship.

373
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,371
Caroline.
Oh God. Caroline!

374
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:15,779
<i>- Oh. Do not
come out of there.
- I know!</i>

375
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:22,552
- What now?
- Excuse me, Mr. Draper.

376
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,021
- I'm really sorry
to bother you again.

377
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:29,893
<i>- are you sure?</i>

378
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,062
- I'm afraid so.
- What happened?

379
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:39,836
Jesus.

380
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,006
Poor thing.

381
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,041
Should we call an ambulance?

382
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:49,012
The coroner.

383
00:20:50,214 --> 00:20:51,481
What about them?

384
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,786
- I'll attend to this.
- Sally's in there.

385
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:59,456
- Why?
- She's visiting.

386
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,401
Megan, get a man,
and we'll need a blanket.

387
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,537
There's an afghan
on Mr. Crane's couch.

388
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,542
She seemed fine
just a minute ago.

389
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:32,422
So where are we?

390
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,059
- Have we agreed
on a strategy?
- I'm not sure.

391
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,495
<i>This is where we are.</i>

392
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:41,131
<i>Correct me
if I'm wrong, gentlemen,</i>

393
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:44,367
But we believe
by holding onto
Fillmore's reputation

394
00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,803
As a place
for professional mechanics,

395
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,672
<i>We can actually attract
men of all types.</i>

396
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,008
So it's something like

397
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:54,778
"Fillmore auto parts.

398
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,846
For the mechanic
in every man."

399
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:59,482
And although it seems
immaterial to you,

400
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,153
- The Fillmore brothers like it.
- Unanimously.

401
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:07,924
What was that again?

402
00:22:09,226 --> 00:22:11,194
Fillmore auto parts.

403
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:12,929
"For the mechanic
in every man."

404
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:29,813
My mother made that.

405
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:36,286
Can we get your signature?

406
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:38,087
I'm the president.

407
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:54,637
I think this is a winner.

408
00:22:54,705 --> 00:22:57,540
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

409
00:22:58,742 --> 00:23:00,376
Ken, can you show them out?

410
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:01,644
Of course.
This way.

411
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:13,556
My goodness.
I was just talking to her.

412
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:18,895
Listen, my daughter
is sitting in my office.

413
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:21,497
- What?
- She decided
to run away today.

414
00:23:21,565 --> 00:23:23,566
- Sally?
- I'd really appreciate it

415
00:23:23,634 --> 00:23:26,069
If you could go
in my bag, get my keys,
take her to my apartment

416
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,804
And just...
Sit with her.

417
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,505
Are you sure?

418
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:32,108
I would have
my secretary do it,
but she's dead.

419
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:34,110
No, of course.

420
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,679
Okay, do you want
to introduce me?

421
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:38,681
I mean, what do I say to her?

422
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:40,683
Do we really have to have
this discussion right now?

423
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:41,885
You're Faye.

424
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,823
Find Cooper and Roger at lunch

425
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:48,825
And stop them
from bringing
secor back here.

426
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,496
Sally, this is my friend Faye.

427
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:55,331
She's going to take you
to my apartment.

428
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,901
- Why?
- You don't want this
to get worse, believe me.

429
00:24:05,676 --> 00:24:08,611
Hello.
My name is Faye.

430
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:11,714
I know.
My dad just said that.

431
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:23,993
Stop.

432
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:26,763
- Where are they taking her?
- She's going to the morgue.

433
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,865
No, she's not.
She's going to
Frank e. Campbell.

434
00:24:35,472 --> 00:24:38,041
Anyone track down her family?

435
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:40,810
She has a niece.
I'll call her.

436
00:24:40,878 --> 00:24:42,645
I'm sorry, Bert.

437
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,188
Roger.

438
00:24:57,895 --> 00:24:59,662
You should go home.

439
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:05,768
Yes. Take all
my calls up here.

440
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:07,070
Okay.

441
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:12,608
<i>So Fitzgerald says,
"I promised to pour</i>

442
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:14,444
<i>This whiskey over
your grave earlier,
but do you mind</i>

443
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:17,246
"- If I pass it through
me kidneys first?"

444
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:26,522
- Are you all right?
- Oh, damn it,

445
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,057
I don't want to die
in this office.

446
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,293
I almost have twice.

447
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:32,161
Stop it.

448
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:33,997
If it looks
like I'm going,
open a window.

449
00:25:34,064 --> 00:25:35,732
I'd rather flatten
the top of a cab.

450
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:39,936
You are not going
to die in this office.

451
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,041
Poor Ida.

452
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,076
She died like she lived...

453
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:49,612
Surrounded by the people
she answered phones for.

454
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,786
I'm gonna go to
my favorite restaurant

455
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:58,321
And have a glass of cyanide.

456
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:02,225
Or you could join me.

457
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,894
I don't know.

458
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:08,898
- I'm gonna
kill myself, Joanie.
- No, you're not.

459
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:11,434
Go get your things.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

460
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:16,639
I got it.

461
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,515
- Hello, daddy.
- Don't "hello, daddy" me.

462
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:26,916
Go sit down.

463
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:34,023
- How was it?
- Great.

464
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:37,393
We watched a little TV,
one of us took a nap.

465
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:40,530
You want to stay?
You're gonna need to eat.

466
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:43,066
I know,
but I have dinner plans.

467
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:51,774
Thank you.

468
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:54,177
Glad I could help.

469
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:56,913
- Good night, Sally.
- Good night.

470
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:08,558
Can we order a pizza?

471
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:14,464
<i>I want you to
promise me you're never
going to do this again.</i>

472
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:17,233
I promise.

473
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:29,745
Why did you always
pick this place?

474
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:32,047
No chance of running
into anyone

475
00:27:32,115 --> 00:27:34,783
And, of course,
cherry cheesecake.

476
00:27:34,851 --> 00:27:37,819
Well, the clientèle
is older than I remember.

477
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:39,688
But not us.

478
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:46,595
I wish you would talk
to me about things.

479
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:49,931
My husband doesn't like it.

480
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:51,967
I know it's tough,

481
00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:55,203
But he must've known
about the possibilities
when he signed up.

482
00:27:56,372 --> 00:27:57,806
I wasn't consulted.

483
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,274
You're kidding.

484
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:04,012
Because you always
tell Jane about all
of your decisions?

485
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,248
She's the woman behind
the man, isn't she?

486
00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:10,919
Did you listen to my memoirs?

487
00:28:10,987 --> 00:28:13,221
I just have them transcribed

488
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,457
And recycle the tapes.

489
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:17,859
And you're not
a little curious if there's
a chapter called "Joan"?

490
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:20,062
There'd better not be.

491
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:24,866
I know.
That's the problem.

492
00:28:24,934 --> 00:28:26,601
And every time I think back,

493
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:27,903
All the good stuff
was with you.

494
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:33,809
And I'm sorry
I keep pestering you.

495
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:36,111
I just can't help myself.

496
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,880
I don't expect
anything to happen.

497
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:41,183
I appreciate that.

498
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:53,195
Can I ask you something?

499
00:28:53,262 --> 00:28:55,731
Yes, I'm still mad at you.

500
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:57,699
Are you going to marry Faye?

501
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:01,203
What? No.

502
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,039
Is she your girlfriend?

503
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:07,442
- No.
- She had your keys.

504
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:10,712
I gave her my keys.

505
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:14,950
She knew you had peanut butter.

506
00:29:17,487 --> 00:29:19,121
Everyone has peanut butter.

507
00:29:20,556 --> 00:29:22,691
Well, she said
she wanted to meet me.

508
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,459
Why would she want to meet me?

509
00:29:29,832 --> 00:29:32,200
Look, I do like her,

510
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:34,736
But we just work together
and I talk about you a lot.

511
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:37,939
Do you like her?

512
00:29:38,007 --> 00:29:40,675
- She seems nice.
- Well, good.

513
00:29:40,743 --> 00:29:42,878
Maybe you'll get
to see her again sometime.

514
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:58,193
Get out some plates.

515
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:01,530
'cause I didn't want
to take a cab on Broadway.
It's a beautiful night.

516
00:30:01,597 --> 00:30:03,799
I don't like
this neighborhood anymore.

517
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:05,367
What happened to it?

518
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:07,402
Miss Blankenship,
you're not missing anything.

519
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,938
- Do you know
what time it is?
- I do.

520
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:11,273
Oh God.

521
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,908
You know what to do.

522
00:30:12,975 --> 00:30:16,178
- Rog...
- yes. Yes, we do.

523
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:18,914
Look down.
Everything's going
to be fine.

524
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:31,560
- There you go.
- What about her?

525
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,262
Give me your bag.

526
00:30:36,065 --> 00:30:37,399
Rings.

527
00:30:43,072 --> 00:30:45,574
That's everything.
We haven't seen anything.

528
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:52,981
I can't breathe.

529
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:56,218
- I want to scream.
- Don't. Come over here.

530
00:30:58,154 --> 00:31:01,156
- You have to calm down.
- My ring. My ring.

531
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:03,024
Stop it.
Everything can
be replaced.

532
00:31:03,092 --> 00:31:04,793
You're fine.

533
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:27,249
Don't stop.

534
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:39,628
Are you sure you don't want
to call your mother
or your brothers?

535
00:31:41,063 --> 00:31:43,865
It's 9:30.
They're asleep.

536
00:31:50,706 --> 00:31:53,675
Daddy, I love you so much.

537
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:55,744
I love you too.

538
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,514
Did you brush your hair?

539
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:01,316
I want to live
with you all the time.

540
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:06,154
You can't do that, honey.

541
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:08,757
Why not?
I'll be good.

542
00:32:10,426 --> 00:32:12,761
Where are you gonna go
to school down here?

543
00:32:12,828 --> 00:32:14,896
What about your friends?
What about your brothers?

544
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:20,468
They could live here too.
I'll watch them.

545
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:21,903
Sally.

546
00:32:23,205 --> 00:32:24,806
Go to sleep.

547
00:33:30,873 --> 00:33:33,742
- Sally?
- I made French toast.

548
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:37,612
You know I don't like
you using the stove.

549
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,881
Oh, daddy,
I do it all the time.

550
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:41,549
And there's no shells in it.

551
00:33:43,486 --> 00:33:45,153
Do you want me
to turn on the TV?

552
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:46,688
We can watch
"the today show."

553
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:48,456
No.

554
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:50,125
Where'd you learn
how to do this?

555
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:51,693
Carla taught me.

556
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:55,196
What's on this?

557
00:33:55,264 --> 00:33:57,198
Mrs. Butterworth's.

558
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:58,566
Go get it.

559
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:08,843
That's rum.
Read labels.

560
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:10,845
Is it bad?

561
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,515
Not really.

562
00:34:16,052 --> 00:34:18,019
Get dressed
and I'll get you
a bun at the office.

563
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:19,687
Can't we do something?

564
00:34:25,861 --> 00:34:28,463
All right,
here's the deal.
No negotiating.

565
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:30,799
I'm gonna call in,
move everything to noon,

566
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:32,467
And we're gonna go
to the central park zoo.

567
00:34:32,535 --> 00:34:35,970
- And the dinosaur museum?
- One or the other.

568
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:38,106
We only have till noon.

569
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:39,808
You finish your breakfast.

570
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,276
I'm going to get ready.

571
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:49,384
You want me
to get don to do it?

572
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:51,719
Of course,
he didn't really know her.

573
00:34:53,122 --> 00:34:54,589
No, he didn't.

574
00:34:58,027 --> 00:34:59,627
Caroline,
get Mrs. Harris.

575
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:02,397
It's regarding
Ida Blankenship's obit.

576
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:04,766
That ought to get her in here.

577
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:07,068
This is an insult to her.

578
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,170
I can't think of anything.

579
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:12,640
And I have no office
in which to ruminate.

580
00:35:16,145 --> 00:35:18,313
Cooper's trying
to write an obit...

581
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,882
Something sharp and sweet.

582
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:25,286
Well, Mr. Cooper,

583
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:27,188
Shall we say,

584
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:29,591
- "beloved friend..."
- Mmm.

585
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:31,993
"...Devoted caretaker..."

586
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:34,496
Put "quietly in her sleep,"
of course.

587
00:35:34,563 --> 00:35:35,763
What's her profession...
secretary?

588
00:35:35,831 --> 00:35:37,765
Executive secretary.

589
00:35:39,435 --> 00:35:42,036
She was born in 1898 in a barn.

590
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:46,207
She died on the ##37th floor
of a skyscraper.

591
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:48,810
She's an astronaut.

592
00:35:52,248 --> 00:35:53,815
<i>Hey.</i>

593
00:35:57,153 --> 00:35:59,220
Is this what it took
to get you in here?

594
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:03,658
Look, I'm sorry.

595
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:07,061
It was in the heat
of the moment.

596
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:10,932
And there was a moment.
You know that.

597
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:14,469
I'm not sorry,

598
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:16,371
But I'm married.

599
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:19,140
And so are you.

600
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,075
I feel something

601
00:36:22,244 --> 00:36:23,578
And I know you do.

602
00:36:35,546 --> 00:36:37,280
Good afternoon.

603
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:40,283
- Hello.
- Sally, this is Megan.

604
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:44,087
- Where's miss Blankenship?
- She went away.

605
00:36:44,155 --> 00:36:45,489
I'm helping out
for a little bit.

606
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:50,227
Her mother should be
by at 5:00. Can you
handle five minutes?

607
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:52,162
Are you hungry?

608
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,297
She ate plenty.

609
00:36:54,365 --> 00:36:55,932
I'm gonna get coffee
and check in.

610
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:05,509
Shit.
Now we can't leave.

611
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:08,578
Huh. Harry said on
the form where it says
"cause of death,"

612
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:11,715
They wrote "don draper."

613
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:14,051
How long do you think
Yvette Mimieux's gonna
last on his desk?

614
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:16,186
I say we start a pool

615
00:37:16,254 --> 00:37:18,722
On whether she's fired,
quits or dies.

616
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:25,429
Where's Dr. Miller?

617
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:27,764
- I don't know
if she's coming in.
- She is.

618
00:37:27,832 --> 00:37:30,534
Well, the Fillmores
want a jingle,

619
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,803
A c-c-c-catchy tune.

620
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,438
<i>- don't do that.</i>

621
00:37:36,607 --> 00:37:39,943
Harry says no rock 'n' roll
if we want middle-class men.

622
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:42,679
He was pushing Perry Como.

623
00:37:42,747 --> 00:37:44,881
And we had pat Boone,
Roger Miller,

624
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:47,084
Frankie Laine, Duane eddy.

625
00:37:47,151 --> 00:37:48,652
I'm glad I came in for this.

626
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:52,155
How about Harry Belafonte?

627
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:53,890
Everyone likes him.

628
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:57,227
I'll get you tickets
to Harry Belafonte.

629
00:37:57,295 --> 00:38:00,130
Believe me, he ain't selling
auto parts for these guys.

630
00:38:00,198 --> 00:38:04,067
Well, maybe it'll help them
with their image in the South.

631
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:07,037
They don't want help.
Have you ever been
to the South?

632
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:08,271
'cause they have a way
of doing things

633
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,407
And it doesn't include
Harry Belafonte.

634
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:12,375
The Fillmore brothers
are from Boston.

635
00:38:12,443 --> 00:38:14,111
Same thing.

636
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:15,946
Well, why are we doing business

637
00:38:16,013 --> 00:38:17,581
With someone that
doesn't hire Negroes?

638
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:25,822
Our job is to make men
like Fillmore auto,

639
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,191
Not make Fillmore auto
like Negroes.

640
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:37,067
Pick one,
get it written
and recorded

641
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:39,402
And if they want
to change it, we will
charge them to change it.

642
00:38:41,072 --> 00:38:42,839
How about Dean Martin?

643
00:38:42,907 --> 00:38:45,041
He's friends
with Sammy Davis Jr.

644
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:47,077
Does that work for you, Peggy?

645
00:38:51,782 --> 00:38:54,584
Mrs. Francis is going to be
in the lobby any minute.

646
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:56,586
I have to cover reception,
per Joan's orders.

647
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:58,088
Go ahead.

648
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:03,793
Your mother's going to be
downstairs in a minute.

649
00:39:03,861 --> 00:39:05,395
Get your things.

650
00:39:05,463 --> 00:39:07,030
I wanna stay.

651
00:39:07,098 --> 00:39:08,632
Well, you can't.

652
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:11,034
I want to stay
and I don't know
why I can't.

653
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:13,103
Because you have to go home.

654
00:39:13,171 --> 00:39:15,772
I'll be good.
I promise.

655
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,975
- Come on.
- No.

656
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,744
- Let's go.
- No! No!

657
00:39:20,811 --> 00:39:23,780
No no! I'm not going
anywhere! Stop it!

658
00:39:23,848 --> 00:39:26,283
<i>- Do you want me
to carry you out of here?
- I'm not going.</i>

659
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,318
<i>I'm not leaving.
I hate it there!</i>

660
00:39:29,754 --> 00:39:31,521
Is everything okay?

661
00:39:34,892 --> 00:39:37,127
- Can you talk to her?
- What?

662
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:38,528
Please. I can't
bring her back

663
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:40,297
Kicking and screaming
to her mother.

664
00:39:40,364 --> 00:39:42,065
I don't have
much child psychology.

665
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:44,067
Just talk to her.

666
00:39:48,506 --> 00:39:50,674
Dr. Faye wants
to talk to you.

667
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:54,744
Hi, Sally.

668
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:56,513
Remember me from yesterday?

669
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:04,120
I know
you don't want to go,
but you have to.

670
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:07,691
- Your mother came
all the way out here.
- You don't know my mother.

671
00:40:07,758 --> 00:40:09,292
Sally.

672
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,930
Sally,

673
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:16,700
Sometimes we have to do things
we don't want to do.

674
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:19,202
- Shut up.
- What's gotten into you?

675
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,138
- I don't think
I'm helping here.
- We don't want your help.

676
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:26,309
- Let's go, now.
- Stop it! No! Stop it!

677
00:40:45,496 --> 00:40:47,197
It's gonna be all right.

678
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:49,532
No, it's not.

679
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:56,206
I fall all the time.

680
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,878
I was coming to get you.

681
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:04,714
Mrs.... Your...

682
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:06,583
Sally's mother is in reception.

683
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,253
Thank you.

684
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,733
I was worried about you.

685
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,013
Come on, let's go.

686
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:38,648
I was waiting
in the lobby at 5:00.

687
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:41,685
- We lost track of time.
- Well, now I'm late.

688
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:46,056
Sally?

689
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:49,259
- Say goodbye
to your father.
- Goodbye.

690
00:41:52,663 --> 00:41:54,064
Excuse me.

691
00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:59,069
Thank you.

692
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:13,216
Hi. Are you here
to see Peggy?

693
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,593
Can you make me one of those?

694
00:42:24,929 --> 00:42:27,597
No. No, I can't.

695
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:32,736
- I can't do
anything for you.
- Why are you upset?

696
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:34,471
You shouldn't have
put me in that position.

697
00:42:35,906 --> 00:42:37,741
Things happen.
I didn't plan it.

698
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,342
You asked me to go watch her.

699
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,211
There was no one else to do it.

700
00:42:41,278 --> 00:42:44,013
And just now?
What the hell was that?

701
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:46,383
I'm not good with kids.

702
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,585
That was not your fault.

703
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:51,121
<i>Well, it feels like
there was a test
and I failed it.</i>

704
00:42:54,225 --> 00:42:55,859
God knows I'd be lying

705
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:57,594
If I said

706
00:42:57,661 --> 00:43:00,230
Would I meet your children?
When would I meet
your children?

707
00:43:00,297 --> 00:43:02,532
But I don't have any.

708
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:15,812
I'm sorry.

709
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,516
I love children,
but I chose to be
where I am.

710
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:23,253
I don't view it as a failure.

711
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,088
It doesn't matter.

712
00:43:28,225 --> 00:43:30,193
I mean it.

713
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:39,102
Jesus.
What a mess.

714
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:44,240
Part of it's good, right?

715
00:43:48,145 --> 00:43:49,345
Yeah.

716
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:02,025
I'm gonna go.
I didn't really sleep.

717
00:44:05,963 --> 00:44:08,998
We can have
dinner this weekend.
I'll pick a place.

718
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:10,533
Good.

719
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:36,826
<i>Why are you drinking here?</i>

720
00:44:36,894 --> 00:44:39,195
Come on.

721
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:42,365
<i>I don't know what
kind of surprise
you're gonna spring on me.</i>

722
00:44:44,735 --> 00:44:46,603
So Abe Drexler pulled a boner.

723
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,238
It's to be expected.

724
00:44:49,573 --> 00:44:51,140
He seemed so nice.

725
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:54,944
He's a man.
He won't be happy
until he turns you out.

726
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:56,312
What's that supposed to mean?

727
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,448
Gotta be their girl.

728
00:44:58,516 --> 00:45:02,085
It's the way they want it.
Maybe it's biology.

729
00:45:02,152 --> 00:45:05,021
It's like men are
this vegetable soup

730
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:08,157
And we can't put 'em
on a plate or eat 'em
off the counter.

731
00:45:08,225 --> 00:45:11,060
So women are the pot.
They heat 'em up.

732
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:13,196
They hold 'em.
They contain them.

733
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,400
But who wants to be a pot?

734
00:45:17,468 --> 00:45:19,402
<i>Who the hell
said we're not soup?</i>

735
00:45:20,738 --> 00:45:22,472
I don't think that's true.

736
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,541
It's been my experience.

737
00:45:26,343 --> 00:45:29,412
But you know, I wouldn't
have helped Abe out

738
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,148
If I didn't think he was
some very interesting soup.

739
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:37,387
Listen, go ahead without me.

740
00:45:37,454 --> 00:45:39,522
Another time.

741
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:41,624
Are you angry or lovesick?

742
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:44,193
I don't know.

743
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:47,797
Night, peg.

744
00:46:26,804 --> 00:46:28,605
<i>Could you hold that?</i>

745
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:32,742
Hello.
