2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:04,028
This was my father.

3
00:00:04,165 --> 00:00:06,087
My mother was a 23
year old prostitute

4
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:08,295
who died having me.

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:09,592
Lucky Strike.

6
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:11,368
The shot of our lives.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,567
- Tell me what you think.
- I think you are the client,

8
00:00:13,696 --> 00:00:14,728
you should do what you want.

9
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:18,831
The lost of Jai Alai makes
Lucky Strike 71% of our billings.

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,575
You said you'd always come home.

11
00:00:20,695 --> 00:00:21,991
Did you make him leave?

12
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:23,407
I wanna take you
in that bedroom

13
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:25,512
and give you a go around
like you've never had.

14
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:27,737
When are you moving out?

15
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,665
We haven't found the
right place for the kids.

17
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:14,333
I'm worried that's
gonna hit the ceiling.

18
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:16,300
We always get a tall one.

19
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,801
Not taller
than the living room.

20
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:20,334
Let's go back to the other one

21
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:22,102
And stand next to it.

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,003
Hey, Sally. Sally.

23
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,470
Hello.

24
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:34,471
- It's Glen.
- I know that.

25
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:37,005
Well, you all just
walked right by me
when you came in.

26
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:39,105
Sorry.

27
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:41,472
What are you doing back here?

28
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,273
My mom got married
and now I'm supposed
to live with him.

29
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,908
I saw your new dad.
My mom said that
would happen.

30
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,242
After they're married awhile,
they'll have a baby.

31
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,943
You should probably ask
for something big now.

32
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:58,345
Hi. Are you
getting a tree?

33
00:01:58,412 --> 00:02:00,445
No, I'm working.

34
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:03,847
- What do you do?
- I bring twine over.

35
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,715
I get to cut it.

36
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:09,615
- Wow.
- Yeah, I made it.

37
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:11,983
Those are good colors.

38
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:15,151
We're leaving as soon
as I find you.

39
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,519
- Bye, Glen.
- Maybe I'll call you.

40
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,692
- Good time,
bad time?
- Yes.

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,794
you've got a resume

42
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:37,695
From the girl you met
at the Ziegfeld theater.

43
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:40,763
- File it.
- Al Weaver
at Johnson wax

44
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,764
Requested another
print of glo-coat.

45
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:46,866
And you got this
very important
piece of mail.

46
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:52,669
Open it.

47
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:59,705
"dear daddy,
Bobby thinks this is
going to the north pole

48
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:02,507
But we should
keep up the roos."

49
00:03:02,574 --> 00:03:05,675
- R-double-o-s.
- Too much television.

50
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:08,176
"Bobby says he knows
that he doesn't deserve"

51
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:10,411
A heath Kit radio
because of what happened

52
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:13,012
With leaving
the freezer open
in the garage

53
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:17,481
But maybe Santa could
choose from a bicycle,
a better pellet gun,

54
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:19,516
A clock radio,
a transistor radio,

55
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:21,384
"A drum set
and a bicycle."

56
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,252
I left that freezer open.

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,654
"baby gene wants a fireman.

58
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,055
I don't know
what that means."

59
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,957
Adorable.

60
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:32,458
"and I would like
the gold necklace"

61
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:35,360
That you can
put your initials on
that we saw at Macy's.

62
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:38,830
And most of all,
I'd like you to be here
on Christmas morning

63
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:41,999
"To give it to me,
but I know you can't be."

64
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:48,403
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:55,141
So a drum set, a fire truck...

66
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:57,777
The necklace is $30.

67
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:00,747
It's s. B.D....
Sally Beth draper.

68
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:05,886
and...

69
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:08,722
Get her some Beatles 45s

70
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:11,691
And him a transistor radio too.

71
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,261
Um, the girls went to Joan

72
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,063
And I don't want
to undermine her,

73
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,433
But are we allowed
to bring a friend
to the Christmas party?

74
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:23,102
Lane scaled it back

75
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,905
To a glass of gin
and a box of Velveeta.

76
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:27,607
We're tightening our belts.

77
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:31,144
<i>But you will be
getting a bonus,</i>

78
00:04:31,212 --> 00:04:32,612
Even if I have to
see to it myself.

79
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,181
Well, thank you.

80
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,984
I didn't want to have
to write a letter to Santa.

81
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:41,087
- Do you want this?
- Sure.

82
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:47,325
Send him in.

83
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:51,696
ready Freddy.

84
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:53,731
It's been too long.

85
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,699
Nah, just long enough.

86
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,968
You look good.
Have a seat.

87
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:59,771
Jeez.

88
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,973
It looks like
an Italian hospital in here.

89
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,275
I know, I know.
Jane got a decorator.

90
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:07,445
I feel like with my hair
you can't even see me in here.

91
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:09,681
- Something brown?
- Maybe later.

92
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:12,750
What time is it?
Oh, look at that.

93
00:05:12,818 --> 00:05:16,054
So I thought it'd
be best if I broached
this opportunity in person.

94
00:05:16,122 --> 00:05:18,056
Well, don't be fooled
by the setup here.

95
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:19,490
It's Potemkinville.

96
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:21,692
Well, maybe I can help.

97
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,894
I walked out of j.W.T.

98
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:26,796
With a present
under my arm...
pond's cold cream.

99
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:29,765
It's $2 million,
but they'll never
even notice it's gone.

100
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,834
How the hell did you do that?

101
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,069
Suffice it to say

102
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:36,171
The client and I are
in a fraternity together.

103
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:39,273
I can't handle
the account myself,

104
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,875
But I'm clean and sober now...

105
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:43,710
16 months without a drop.

106
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:47,346
- So when you
said "maybe later"?
- What am I gonna say?

107
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,449
Look, if it doesn't work out,
you can keep the account.

108
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,651
What am I gonna say?

109
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:54,319
Yes.

110
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:57,054
There is one little caveat.

111
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,956
Name it.

112
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:01,691
I feel like I'm getting
sucked into that thing.

113
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:06,295
I don't want
Pete Campbell near this.

114
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:08,230
I was surprised
you took him along.

115
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,801
No comment.

116
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:16,870
Sugarberry has been
selling hams for 30 years
at a fairly steady rate

117
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:19,139
While doing in everything
they could to create sales,

118
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:21,274
And then we do this in a month.

119
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:22,942
We have to give them time
to reconcile that.

120
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,745
- Freddy!
- Ballerina.

121
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:31,283
I feel like the tin man.

122
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,351
Good to see you.

123
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:35,153
How are you, Freddy?

124
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:36,855
Couldn't be better.

125
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:38,323
I was just talking about you.

126
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:41,526
Freddy here just
ran in from the yard

127
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:43,561
With a $2-million account
in his mouth.

128
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:46,264
- Pond's cold cream.
- Well, that explains
why you look so good.

129
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:51,269
A little early for that,
isn't it, don?

130
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:52,670
Very funny.

131
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,808
The pedigree
of this account is
that it was boosted.

132
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,777
And I'll need to maintain
my personal contact
to it creatively.

133
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,546
If that's all right
with you, don.

134
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:03,047
If you don't mind working
with this old thing over here.

135
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:05,216
I was counting on it.

136
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:07,985
- Oh, none for me.
- Oh.

137
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,925
- When can you bring 'em in?
- I'll be handling
this one, Pete.

138
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,296
Well, Freddy,
I hate to bring this up,

139
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:22,166
But I do believe
it's on everyone's mind.

140
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,102
We all want to know
if you can be Santa
at the Christmas party.

141
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,037
It's the role
I was born to play.

142
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:36,680
Francis residence.

143
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,816
Can Sally come to the phone?

144
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:40,785
Who may I say is calling?

145
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:43,554
Stanley. I have
a question about homework.

146
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,858
Sally, there's a young man
on the phone... Stanley.

147
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:53,265
- Hello?
- It's Glen.

148
00:07:53,332 --> 00:07:55,100
Oh, hi.

149
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,735
Don't you wanna know why
I said my name is Stanley?

150
00:07:57,803 --> 00:07:59,770
I guess.

151
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:02,206
Because this is private.

152
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:09,547
- Where are you?
- Where do you think?

153
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,282
I'm down the street
at my mom's.

154
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:16,887
How come you didn't move?

155
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,356
I don't know.

156
00:08:19,424 --> 00:08:22,860
I hate it here.
I really really do.

157
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,761
Why?

158
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,563
I won't tell anybody.

159
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:30,233
Every time I go
around a corner,

160
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,735
I keep thinking
I'll see my dad.

161
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,903
Sorry.

162
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:38,273
- They're not gonna get
back together, you know.
- Glen?

163
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:40,942
Especially now
that she's doing it
with somebody else.

164
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,779
<i>- Doing what?
Glen!</i>

165
00:08:43,846 --> 00:08:45,347
Well, don't worry.

166
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:47,449
One day they'll wake up
and they'll want to move.

167
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:49,384
You'll see.
I've gotta go. Bye.

168
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,386
Goodbye.

169
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:58,026
- Who's Stanley?
- A boy.

170
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:02,932
We will soon
be charging clients
for this service

171
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:05,134
And Dr. Atherton will
in turn be charging us.

172
00:09:05,202 --> 00:09:06,836
Significantly less.

173
00:09:06,904 --> 00:09:10,204
Bert and I have
been meaning to work
together for years.

174
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:12,072
Out in the open at least.

175
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,106
Very good then.
Shall we dim the lights?

176
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:17,810
No, beginning the presentation
with the film is a mistake.

177
00:09:17,877 --> 00:09:20,812
Audiences will listen
to anything in anticipation.

178
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,947
See what I was talking about?

179
00:09:23,015 --> 00:09:26,150
Simply said, we believe
that at the motivational
research group,

180
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,585
We have brought the science
of consumer evaluation

181
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:31,921
To a point of precision like
that of a surgeon's scalpel.

182
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,056
No doubt, with the help of minds
like Dr. Faye Miller,

183
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:37,692
With whose work you are
already unknowingly familiar.

184
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,461
Faye helped develop
the indelible image

185
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:43,697
That has become
the standard of feminine
hygiene advertising...

186
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:47,034
The carefree gal
in white pants.

187
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:52,772
It's right up there
with the polio vaccine.

188
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:57,943
Beyond demographic
information...

189
00:09:58,011 --> 00:09:59,978
Salary, age,
marital situation...

190
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:02,080
We've tried to find
a way to select prospects

191
00:10:02,147 --> 00:10:03,748
Who can really provide insight.

192
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:05,916
This test is our beginning.

193
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:08,285
Take a minute, fill it out

194
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:10,220
And please take a cookie.

195
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:12,455
What's it mean if we don't?

196
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:14,623
That you're a psychopath.

197
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,060
<i>The point
of this exercise is</i>

198
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,128
To familiarize you
with our methods.

199
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:25,533
The point of the cookies
is that everyone should be
rewarded for their time.

200
00:10:26,868 --> 00:10:29,937
These questions
have been designed

201
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,705
To get at what
subjects really want

202
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:33,874
<i>Instead of what
they say they do.</i>

203
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:37,778
What are the real feelings
that exist below the surface?

204
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,414
For example, "how would you
describe your father?"

205
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:43,383
No matter what the answer,

206
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:45,752
It creates
a level of intimacy
for the next question,

207
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,521
"who makes decisions
in your household?"

208
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,957
There's some pencils
if you need them.

209
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,874
I apologize.
I have an appointment.

210
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,619
That is yours to keep.

211
00:11:22,356 --> 00:11:25,825
- Is that work?
- No, it's me.
It's kind of silly.

212
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:27,826
Tell me when
they pull the curtains
so I can get out of here.

213
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,595
- Do you want ice?
- Yes.

214
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,841
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

215
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:46,578
Saint Vincent's junior staff
Christmas party.

216
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:50,348
- At 8:00 in the morning?
- Well, the shift just ended
and we have to do it soon,

217
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:53,917
Because Christmas
and new year's we're
overrun with suicides.

218
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:57,387
- Well, uh...
- Phoebe.

219
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,923
And you're don.
I know.

220
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:03,361
- I hope we haven't met.
- Well, I'm right
across the hall.

221
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,463
We wave to each other.

222
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:09,065
You met my friend Sarah.
She fell on the stairs.

223
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:11,034
Maybe you weren't in uniform.

224
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:13,904
Don't pretend that
you've never noticed me.

225
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,341
You always grunt when you put
your keys in the door.

226
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:23,079
It's not good,
which is why I am
inviting you to my party.

227
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:26,016
I really appreciate
the invitation, Phoebe,

228
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,651
But I'm late for work.

229
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:30,053
So you should thank me
for waking you.

230
00:12:34,726 --> 00:12:37,895
Tallulah Bankhead,
she's glamorous.

231
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:40,231
She seems
more uncompromising
than a movie star,

232
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,866
You know,
because she's on Broadway.

233
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,368
She never got off Broadway
because she's not
beautiful enough.

234
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:46,770
Shame on you.
Come on.

235
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:49,607
A little backstage
at the makeup mirror
with pond's.

236
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:51,675
A big bouquet of roses,
opening night.

237
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:53,410
"the choice
of professionals."

238
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:55,412
It's good, right?

239
00:12:57,282 --> 00:13:00,817
All of their research
says that they're trying
to get young women.

240
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:02,986
Well, young women
look up to older women.

241
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:05,955
For beauty tips?
Are you joking?

242
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:08,224
I know the client.
This thing is rigged.

243
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,228
<i>- That's what he wants.
- It's not just about
the client.</i>

244
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:13,931
People are looking
at everything we do here.

245
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:16,734
Have you seen our work?
It's very different than this.

246
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:19,403
- Frederick van Rumsen!
- Von.

247
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:22,206
boy oh boy,
were you missed at lunch.

248
00:13:22,274 --> 00:13:24,208
Cal Rutledge
from pond's.
What a cut-up.

249
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:27,578
- What do you mean?
- I mean I've got
to go lay down.

250
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,954
- I can't believe
that's his job.

251
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:43,493
Hello. Can you tell him
Mr. Rumsen's on the phone?

252
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:47,364
- Interrupt him.
- What's wrong?

253
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,202
Calvin, do you have
anything to tell me?

254
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,637
Uh-huh.

255
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:57,073
Did you just have lunch
with Roger sterling?

256
00:13:58,675 --> 00:13:59,909
So you have nothing to say?

257
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:03,279
Hey hey, don't do that.

258
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:05,047
It's okay.

259
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,317
Pull yourself together.

260
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:12,588
First baptist church,
79th and Broadway.

261
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:18,394
- I've gotta go.
- Is everything okay?

262
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:20,930
What, you can't put
two and two together?

263
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:24,767
Listen, cutie,
wrap your head around

264
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:26,335
Finding the right famous face

265
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:28,104
Or my other thing
about the t zone.

266
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,406
I want 10 tags apiece,

267
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:32,474
Then I narrow it down
and then we go to don.

268
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,410
are you serious?

269
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:36,678
I'll do 'em too.
Don't worry.

270
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:39,248
I'm sure yours'll be better
because you're girlier.

271
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:45,286
<i>Lee garner Jr.</i>

272
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,925
Put him through.

273
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:53,261
<i>- Caroline, did he say
what it was about?

274
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,535
Well, hello, Lee.
How's palm beach?

275
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:02,271
Beautiful.
Heading back there
in a couple of days.

276
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,706
Back? Where the hell
are you?

277
00:15:03,773 --> 00:15:06,876
In town doing a little
Christmas shopping.

278
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:08,711
Yeah, I'd love
to see you now that
I know you're in town.

279
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,246
Caroline!

280
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:15,284
- How about dinner tomorrow?
- Christmas party.

281
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:17,219
How about lunch?
We're having a Christmas party.

282
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:19,755
Why am I getting
my invitation so late?

283
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:21,490
Because I thought
you were out of town.

284
00:15:21,558 --> 00:15:24,226
Huh. Madison Avenue
office Christmas party?

285
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:26,028
I've seen the movies.
You find me.

286
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:28,530
Okay. 3:00?

287
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,398
- No, 4:00.
- 5:00.

288
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:31,465
Shit. Go get Lee.

289
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:34,769
I'm looking forward to it.

290
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:36,271
You won't be disappointed.

291
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,373
Oh.

292
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:45,914
I just got off the phone
with Lee garner Jr.

293
00:15:45,982 --> 00:15:49,251
He's going to stop by.
We're going to have to
have a Christmas party,

294
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:51,120
- A real one.
- How did that happen?

295
00:15:51,188 --> 00:15:53,256
It happened.
In fact, he was offended

296
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:54,991
That we hadn't
invited him already.

297
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,960
Uninvite him.

298
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:59,530
Take him to the four seasons.
He can have three entries.

299
00:15:59,598 --> 00:16:01,465
This man doesn't care
about food.

300
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:07,403
I know that you've
lived your life from
a bottomless pocket,

301
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:11,140
But there's a very real
system of money coming in
versus money going out.

302
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,310
Overtime,
supplies being
used carelessly,

303
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:17,914
Leaving the lights on,
parties... it adds up.

304
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:20,617
Listen, Olivier,
aren't you the one
who's always talking about

305
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:23,920
How lucky strike is 99%
of our business or something?

306
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:26,389
69% if we land
pond's cold cream.

307
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:28,457
We have pond's
and I hate the way
you say "percent,"

308
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:31,494
- Do you know that?
- What about our other clients?

309
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:33,462
We have no other clients.

310
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,900
If Lee garner Jr.
Wants three wise men
flown in from Jerusalem,

311
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:40,669
He gets it.
Caroline!

312
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:44,507
Get Joanie in here.
You want something?
I brought it from home.

313
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:50,748
- Yes?
- There's been
a small adjustment

314
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:52,917
To the scale
of our Christmas party.

315
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:56,453
- Lower or higher?
- Lee garner Jr. Will
be joining us.

316
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,222
I trust you will make
the appropriate improvements.

317
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,090
Well, I don't.
We need to change
its rating

318
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:03,760
From convalescent home
to Roman orgy.

319
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,933
Maalox.

320
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:13,805
I want a bartender and a tree.

321
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:15,607
Screw him.
I love Christmas.

322
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,609
You love Christmas parties.

323
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:19,711
We're going to need
more employees,

324
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,347
So I'm going to allow
everyone escorts,
even the girls.

325
00:17:22,415 --> 00:17:24,683
New York food...
deli and Chinese...

326
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,518
And some kind of gift
for Mr. Garner.

327
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,220
You're off-limits.

328
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:30,655
I don't think he's the one
who needs to be reminded.

329
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,524
Oh, come on.

330
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,793
He was all over you
the time you wore
that red dress...

331
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:37,196
The one with the bow
in the back that makes
you look like a present.

332
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,732
- You have an incredible memory.
- Yeah, I think about it a lot...

333
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,101
That dress, I mean.

334
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:45,505
- Could you wear it?
- Stop it.

335
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:46,973
I didn't mean it that way.

336
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:51,544
All I was saying was
this is the office
and that's life.

337
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,412
This is good

338
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,314
And that's life.

339
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:06,712
What a nice surprise.

340
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,680
Sheila at the station
baked them.

341
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:11,481
Sheila.
Who's Sheila?

342
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,384
Huh.
She's 60 years old.

343
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:16,251
You see how shaky the icing is?

344
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:25,326
Hey, knock it off.

345
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:27,195
Why?
Is Rasputin home?

346
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:28,996
Shh. She'll hear you.

347
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,165
I want to lie down.
I'm tired.

348
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:34,234
Uh-huh. My bed is
covered with work.

349
00:18:34,302 --> 00:18:37,638
- That's kind of symbolic.
- How is my face?

350
00:18:37,706 --> 00:18:40,641
Fresh, dewy, well cared for?

351
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,443
Let me get a better look.

352
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,080
you taste like soap.

353
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:48,118
I'm in the middle
of a seven-day beauty plan.

354
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:50,186
can't we just

355
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,789
Get undressed
and lie together again?

356
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,761
That was a bad idea.

357
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:59,598
how long is this
gonna go on?

358
00:18:59,665 --> 00:19:02,333
Oh, I'm sorry you feel
you've put in the time.

359
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:05,870
- We're not doing anything.
- We're doing some things.

360
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,607
We're not doing anything
I can't do myself.

361
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:12,745
Mark.

362
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:15,014
I told you I want you.

363
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:18,284
In fact I want you
so much I wanna wait.

364
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:21,488
And I told you there's
nothing to be afraid of.

365
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,992
I want to be your first.

366
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:33,001
You're so old-fashioned.

367
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:34,670
No, I'm not.

368
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:38,508
In Sweden, they make love

369
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:40,511
The minute they feel attracted.

370
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,580
And it's healthier,
because you can find,

371
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:45,284
You know, the perfect person.

372
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,193
Because making love is
a very important part
of a life with someone.

373
00:19:49,463 --> 00:19:53,243
The most important.
In Sweden, anyway.

374
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:55,480
Where did you hear that?

375
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:57,716
I read this article,
"the Swedish way of love."

376
00:19:57,784 --> 00:19:59,985
It's very enlightened.

377
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:02,822
You're never going
to get me to do anything
Swedish people do.

378
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,625
All you have
to do is take a couple
of steps that way.

379
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:09,630
- I brought you cookies.
- Huh.

380
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:14,836
I think you should go home.

381
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:29,354
<i>And I want you
to think about that.</i>

382
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:45,235
Sorry.
Everybody leaves

383
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:46,904
The moment
you have to clean up.

384
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,742
I might have a vacuum.

385
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,718
where the hell are
you coming from?

386
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:03,655
- Work.
- Where do you work?

387
00:21:03,723 --> 00:21:05,324
The white horse tavern?

388
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:10,166
Did you have
a party or something?

389
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:13,870
- I hate parties.
- And you hate Christmas.

390
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:16,978
- I got it.
- I don't hate Christmas.

391
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:19,079
I hate this Christmas.

392
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,285
Of course you have heat.

393
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:33,420
Can I get you something?

394
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:38,389
Come on.
You're going to bed.

395
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:43,989
Look where we are.

396
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,589
- You're good with that.
- My father was a drunk.

397
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:53,325
If you don't behave yourself,

398
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:54,891
I'm not gonna take
your shoes off

399
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:57,025
And you're gonna wake up
with sores on your heels.

400
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,327
How can you stand going
to a hospital every day?

401
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:05,428
I love working
at the hospital...

402
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:08,462
People coming into the world,

403
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,897
People leaving it.

404
00:22:09,965 --> 00:22:11,866
Everything happens there.

405
00:22:16,304 --> 00:22:18,037
good night, don.

406
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:21,874
good night!

407
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,282
Against the wall,
please. Megan.

408
00:22:35,286 --> 00:22:37,887
The bar looks good.
I need you to get

409
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:39,787
The chafing dishes
and the sternos.

410
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:42,485
Then call Peking house
and move the delivery
from 4:00 to 3:30.

411
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:44,452
- They're always late.
- Yes, Joan.

412
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,387
that one.

413
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:52,116
On the short list I've got
Tallulah, Jessica Tandy,

414
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:54,247
Barbara Stanwyck and Doris day.

415
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:58,077
- Different types.
- I don't even understand
your list.

416
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00,842
What's wrong
with Elizabeth Taylor?

417
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,411
Isn't it about making
old ladies look good?

418
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:05,246
Nothing makes
old ladies look good.

419
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:08,082
But pond's does.
That's the point.

420
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,050
If young girls
started using it,

421
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:12,686
Maybe they'd find a husband
and they wouldn't be so angry.

422
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:18,257
All I was trying to say
is that I've used the stuff

423
00:23:18,324 --> 00:23:21,025
And I think
there's something
about the experience

424
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:23,327
Of putting it on
and looking in the mirror.

425
00:23:23,395 --> 00:23:26,363
If we were
to go another way,
that's not a bad idea.

426
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,764
Indulging yourself, right?

427
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:31,000
No, if you use pond's,
you'll get married.

428
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:34,069
That's not what I was saying.

429
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:35,436
Or we could go the other way.

430
00:23:35,504 --> 00:23:38,005
If you don't use it,
then you'll never get married.

431
00:23:39,274 --> 00:23:40,940
Which is better?

432
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:42,542
You know what?
Just write 'em down.

433
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:44,443
No, I'm not writing that down.

434
00:23:45,812 --> 00:23:48,513
I'm sorry if I hit
a nerve there, precious.

435
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:51,749
You know, Freddy, I have
brought your name up 100 times

436
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:55,219
In the last year to come in
and freelance, for me,

437
00:23:55,286 --> 00:23:57,887
But everybody is
right about you.

438
00:23:57,955 --> 00:24:01,823
You and your grand dames,
your portable typewriter

439
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:04,058
And your desperate spinsters...

440
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:05,626
You're old-fashioned.
You know that?

441
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,797
<i>- Miss Olson?
- Yes?</i>

442
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:13,065
<i>Everybody's leaving
to get dressed
for the party.</i>

443
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,301
<i>- Do you need me right now?
- No, you can go.</i>

444
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:21,839
I... I'm...

445
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:24,108
I'm sorry, Freddy.

446
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:25,742
Don't worry about it.

447
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:28,544
Is Violet coming?

448
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:31,446
She wouldn't miss it.

449
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:15,274
<i>- Oh, thank you, dear.
You know Peter.</i>

450
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:20,009
He'd rather spend
every waking second
right here in the city.

451
00:25:20,077 --> 00:25:23,210
Who'd want to miss Christmas
in New York? 5th Avenue...

452
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:25,445
Chestnuts roasting
on a greasy man's
open street cart.

453
00:25:25,513 --> 00:25:27,514
My goodness.

454
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:30,083
We're going to
the Bahamas and there's
nothing else to it.

455
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,284
Harry spent so much time
in Los Angeles,

456
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:34,486
- I figured I'd treat him
to the mountains.
- Stowe.

457
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:37,922
What about you, don?
Do you have any plans?

458
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,492
Yes, heading to Acapulco.

459
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,128
- Are you taking
anyone special?
- No.

460
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:47,097
- Well, it's your own fault.
- Yes, I pity him,

461
00:25:47,164 --> 00:25:49,265
Marooned in
that sea of bikinis.

462
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,534
<i>- merry Christmas.</i>

463
00:25:52,936 --> 00:25:55,037
- Nice to see you again.
- And you as well, sir.

464
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,771
- Don.
- Okay. Don.

465
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,742
We're going to get
something to drink.

466
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,780
Where the hell is he?

467
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:10,783
They are children,

468
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:12,418
And they can't accept the fact

469
00:26:12,486 --> 00:26:14,687
That others have to make
decisions for them.

470
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:18,056
<i>So we are not part
of this herd you're
talking about.</i>

471
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:20,225
you're from Great Britain.

472
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:23,161
I'd think you'd be
familiar with the perils
of socialism.

473
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:26,331
Civil rights is the beginning

474
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:28,233
<i>Of a slippery slope.</i>

475
00:26:28,301 --> 00:26:29,902
If they pass Medicare,

476
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:33,404
They won't stop until
they ban personal property.

477
00:26:33,472 --> 00:26:36,407
Storm our houses
and rape our wives.

478
00:26:36,474 --> 00:26:39,576
Mmm. Mmm.

479
00:26:39,644 --> 00:26:41,644
Man your battle stations!

480
00:26:43,347 --> 00:26:45,515
Nice dress.
Where's Mr. Holloway?

481
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:47,217
Saving lives.

482
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:49,353
Everyone, ladies,
come on, let's go.

483
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:55,759
Don't forget it's a party.

484
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,009
Please please.

485
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:15,645
I walked in here
five minutes ago,
no one did anything.

486
00:27:15,713 --> 00:27:18,448
Merry Christmas, Lee.
That's quite a tan.

487
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:21,384
I work at it.
When can we expepe
something for lucky strike

488
00:27:21,452 --> 00:27:22,952
As good
as "let me out of here!"

489
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:26,021
Well, glo-coat told me
to swing for the fences.

490
00:27:26,088 --> 00:27:28,490
Well, I didn't know
I had to ask, Donny.

491
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:30,960
We have gifts, girls and games,

492
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:32,561
But first I'm going
to get you some food.

493
00:27:32,629 --> 00:27:33,862
Well, that's a good idea, red.

494
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,531
I've been drinking all day.

495
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,477
Don't turn
on the lights, shithead.

496
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:04,126
Come on.

497
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:34,825
If you hear anything, run.
Don't worry about me.

498
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:07,720
Whoo!

499
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,090
Megan, can you get
Mr. Garner a drink?

500
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:14,394
- Where's Santa?
- He didn't show,

501
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,397
But he did leave some presents.

502
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:19,068
- Joan.
- Well, I could've sworn

503
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:21,006
I conga'ed by a suit.

504
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:23,308
- You want to be Santa?
- Hell no.

505
00:29:24,644 --> 00:29:26,211
How about you, Roger?

506
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:28,947
I would but I'm
allergic to velvet.

507
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:30,849
come on. You'll do great.

508
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:32,884
- Are you serious?
- Damn straight.

509
00:29:32,952 --> 00:29:35,587
I don't think so.

510
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:39,424
I'll do it.
I'd love to be Santa.

511
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:40,858
- Yes.
- Oh, come on.

512
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:43,094
It'd take three of you
to fill that suit.

513
00:29:43,162 --> 00:29:45,663
Besides, everybody knows
Santa's got white hair.

514
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:47,698
Put it on, Roger.

515
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:50,968
Come on, Lee.

516
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,737
Put it on.

517
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:08,485
He's a hell of a sport.

518
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:20,530
everybody just stay there.

519
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:27,470
- Call the police.
- Is somebody in the house?

520
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:29,139
Maybe it's a bear.

521
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:32,008
Hello?

522
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:35,478
I'm guessing it's kids.

523
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:39,182
Let me look around the house.

524
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,885
- Hello?
- Just stay here.

525
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:46,089
Where's your lovely wife, lane?

526
00:30:46,157 --> 00:30:48,591
She and my son are in London.

527
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,359
I shall be
joining them soon enough.

528
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:54,263
Mine's in Florida.
I guess we'll suffer
through, eh, Jeeves?

529
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:56,699
<i>- Mmm.
Ho ho ho!</i>

530
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:59,669
Merry Christmas!

531
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:05,375
It's hard to tell
if he's father Christmas
or father time.

532
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:08,076
Merry Christmas!

533
00:31:08,143 --> 00:31:09,844
That's a big bag, Roger.

534
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,713
Don't want you to have
a third heart attack.

535
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:14,315
Right, honey?

536
00:31:16,285 --> 00:31:18,219
What have we here?

537
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:21,522
What do all
the good boys and girls
want for Christmas?

538
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,325
- Lucky strike!
thank you.

539
00:31:24,393 --> 00:31:27,161
You're welcome.
Don't smoke those
all at once.

540
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:31,298
And I have
a very special present

541
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:34,935
For a little boy who knows
he's been naughty.

542
00:31:35,003 --> 00:31:36,069
Lee.

543
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:40,674
You didn't need to do that.

544
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:42,609
Yes, we did.

545
00:31:48,983 --> 00:31:51,318
Look at that.

546
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:52,653
It's a Polaroid.

547
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:56,323
Thank you.

548
00:31:56,391 --> 00:31:58,392
It reminds me
of when I was a kid.

549
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,427
Remember that?

550
00:32:00,495 --> 00:32:02,229
You'd ask for something,
you'd get it

551
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:04,465
And it made you happy.

552
00:32:04,532 --> 00:32:08,602
merry Christmas!

553
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,474
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas, don.

554
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,212
<i>Ho ho ho!</i>

555
00:32:19,581 --> 00:32:21,782
<i>There's eggs in my bed!</i>

556
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:25,485
You can sleep
in our room if you want.

557
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,388
My room's fine.

558
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,163
- Anybody home?
- Not for much longer.

559
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,166
I can't leave until
Geoff and Bert Cooper

560
00:32:52,233 --> 00:32:54,234
Figure out how to take
food from children.

561
00:32:54,302 --> 00:32:56,003
Well, if anyone can do it...

562
00:32:57,705 --> 00:33:00,006
How many Christmas parties
do you have to go to?

563
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:06,446
I pity you.
Please, sit down.

564
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:10,584
No, I just want
to make sure there
were no problems.

565
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,486
You really are
a full-service company.

566
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:15,921
It's just
you didn't take the test

567
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:17,489
And I know you're
the creative shaman
around here,

568
00:33:17,557 --> 00:33:19,291
But you walked out
of my presentation.

569
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:23,697
I'm disappointed.

570
00:33:23,765 --> 00:33:26,167
I thought you
came in to flirt,
but you came in to fight.

571
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,272
You have to know I found out
all I could about you.

572
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:34,208
Your work is very interesting

573
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:36,677
And I guess I was hoping
you thought mine was.

574
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:38,712
It's not personal.
I just don't think

575
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,448
You can learn much
about people that way.

576
00:33:40,515 --> 00:33:42,516
I learned a lot about you.

577
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:45,185
You're the kind
of man who doesn't want
to take the test.

578
00:33:47,088 --> 00:33:49,223
I'm sorry.
I just don't see

579
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,925
How knowing about
my childhood is gonna
help sell floor wax.

580
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:53,960
I saw that ad.

581
00:33:54,028 --> 00:33:55,929
It's all about
somebody's childhood.

582
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:00,066
Look, we're both
in the same business.

583
00:34:00,134 --> 00:34:02,435
I'm not embarrassed to say

584
00:34:02,503 --> 00:34:06,007
It's about helping people
somehow to sort out their
deepest conflict.

585
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:07,709
And what is that?

586
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:09,878
In a nutshell,

587
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:13,514
It all comes down to
"what I want" versus
"what's expected of me."

588
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:21,056
- That's true.
- I know it's true.

589
00:34:21,123 --> 00:34:23,692
You would've known
it's true if you'd
stayed for my presentation.

590
00:34:27,763 --> 00:34:29,897
Want to get some dinner
or something?

591
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:33,467
No thank you.

592
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:34,902
But apology accepted.

593
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:41,108
Look, I know the holidays
are hard in your situation,

594
00:34:41,176 --> 00:34:44,444
But don't worry.
You'll be married
again in a year.

595
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:46,213
What?

596
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,414
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:48,482 --> 00:34:51,683
I always forget...
nobody wants to think
they're a type.

598
00:34:53,052 --> 00:34:54,319
Merry Christmas.

599
00:34:54,387 --> 00:34:56,721
Merry Christmas.

600
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,127
Harry.
Your turn.

601
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,032
sorry sorry sorry.

602
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:35,935
Shit.

603
00:35:54,525 --> 00:35:57,060
I don't see anything.

604
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:58,662
Oh.
Here they are.

605
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,664
- I got 'em.
- Great.

606
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:03,296
<i>Be right there.

607
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:10,957
- Forgot his keys.
- I'll give you
a half an hour

608
00:36:11,025 --> 00:36:13,191
- And then we'll meet
you at Chumley's.
- Make it an hour.

609
00:36:13,258 --> 00:36:15,759
- Might have to get
some food in him.
- He's pathetic.

610
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,801
Hello?

611
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:32,071
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

612
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:36,475
Switched my plans a little bit.

613
00:36:43,182 --> 00:36:45,649
I'm getting you aspirin.
Don't say no.

614
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:49,352
Top right cabinet.

615
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:56,792
<i>- How about some food?
- No.</i>

616
00:37:20,748 --> 00:37:23,517
- Thank you.
- Okay.

617
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,385
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

618
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,665
Don't.

619
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:42,068
Don't what?

620
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:02,254
You smell so good.

621
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,856
I feel dizzy.

622
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:54,071
My goodness.

623
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:58,209
I know.

624
00:39:09,154 --> 00:39:11,021
Oh! I'm supposed
to meet somebody.

625
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:14,990
Oh.

626
00:39:19,328 --> 00:39:20,895
I should really go.

627
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:25,566
You sure?

628
00:39:25,634 --> 00:39:26,501
Yes.

629
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:52,123
I, uh...

630
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,693
I understand.
It's okay.

631
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,963
Okay.

632
00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:04,274
See you tomorrow, I guess.

633
00:40:40,332 --> 00:40:41,632
Freddy.

634
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,035
I'm sorry I'm at your desk.

635
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:45,737
It was the cleanest spot
in the office.

636
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:51,343
Are you okay?
You didn't come
to the party.

637
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:54,146
Oh.

638
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:56,882
It's been my experience

639
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,384
That when they give you
that Santa suit,

640
00:40:58,452 --> 00:41:00,987
There's usually a bottle
already in the pocket.

641
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:03,157
Oh.

642
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:05,125
thank God.

643
00:41:05,193 --> 00:41:07,595
I don't want to worry
that every time I hurt
your feelings

644
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:10,298
You're gonna
start drinking again.

645
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:12,667
Then why don't you stop
hurting my feelings?

646
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:20,408
I'm sorry.

647
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:23,077
I'm sorry I said
you were old-fashioned.

648
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,514
And I'm sorry I said
you wanted to get married.

649
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:33,085
<i>I do want to get married.</i>

650
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:36,088
Well, you've got to work less
and find somebody.

651
00:41:36,156 --> 00:41:38,558
I have a boyfriend.

652
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,426
Is it serious?

653
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:42,429
I don't know yet.

654
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:45,366
He won't leave me alone.

655
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:48,936
It was that way with Violet.

656
00:41:49,004 --> 00:41:50,938
Insatiable.

657
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:52,740
Oh.

658
00:41:52,808 --> 00:41:55,780
Oh.
Freddy, I don't want
to talk about this.

659
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:57,915
Hey, you brought it up.

660
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:02,253
I haven't done
much work on this,
I have to be honest.

661
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,355
I need to get some coffee.

662
00:42:04,423 --> 00:42:06,292
Fine.

663
00:42:14,037 --> 00:42:15,571
I don't want to be alone
on new year's eve.

664
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:21,914
My two cents?

665
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:24,080
If you're gonna marry him,
you can't do anything.

666
00:42:24,148 --> 00:42:25,812
He won't respect you.

667
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,044
What if I don't know?

668
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:31,642
Well, you can't lead him on.

669
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,775
That is physically
very uncomfortable.

670
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,541
It's not a joke.

671
00:42:54,423 --> 00:42:57,592
did you enjoy the
fuhrer's birthday?

672
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,194
may he live for
a thousand years.

673
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:04,366
Oh, my father used to say
this is the greatest job
in the world

674
00:43:04,434 --> 00:43:06,368
Except for one thing...
the clients.

675
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:19,146
Good morning.

676
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:20,279
Did you make it home
last night?

677
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,813
I did.
I did.

678
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,446
Come inside.

679
00:43:30,648 --> 00:43:32,882
- What's all this?
- For your children.

680
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:34,450
I bought them the other day,

681
00:43:34,517 --> 00:43:36,118
But I finally got them wrapped.

682
00:43:37,386 --> 00:43:38,686
Thank you.

683
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:40,488
Want me to get the door?

684
00:43:40,555 --> 00:43:42,256
No.

685
00:43:42,324 --> 00:43:44,691
Do you need some coffee?

686
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:46,526
I had some.

687
00:43:46,593 --> 00:43:48,293
It was quite a party.

688
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:52,530
- I really overdid it.
- Me too.

689
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,100
I, uh...

690
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:03,203
Thank you for bringing my keys.

691
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:06,206
I really appreciate it.

692
00:44:06,274 --> 00:44:08,108
I've probably
taken advantage
of your kindness

693
00:44:08,176 --> 00:44:10,177
On too many occasions.

694
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:13,648
Excuse me?

695
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:18,320
I just wanted
to say thank you
for bringing my keys.

696
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,127
Okay.

697
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,467
I know we talked about
how tough things are
for the firm,

698
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:35,004
But I wanted you to know...

699
00:44:38,274 --> 00:44:41,642
Well, here's the bonus
we talked about.

700
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,046
Merry Christmas.

701
00:44:49,983 --> 00:44:51,416
Thank you.

702
00:44:54,787 --> 00:44:56,821
Anything else for right now?

703
00:44:56,888 --> 00:44:58,455
No.

704
00:46:06,827 --> 00:46:08,127
Hey.

705
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:13,398
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, of course.

706
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:17,268
Do you feel different?
