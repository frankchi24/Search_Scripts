1
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:45,004
Lee, Lee,
Don doesn't think there's a problem.

2
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,386
Lee, those restrictions
aren't going to affect Lucky Strike.

3
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,926
Besides, Lee,
your lawyers came up with them.

4
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,722
"No more smoking teenagers,"
we complied a year ago.

5
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,933
"No more famous athletes"

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,768
and we have to stop using certain angles.

7
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,526
Low angles, wide lenses,

8
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,949
anything that makes the smoker
appear superhuman.

9
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,487
Why is this empty?

10
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,954
Because you drank it all.

11
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,199
-He can't hear you.
-There's kind of a loophole

12
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:17,127
because even without athletes
you can still use sports.

13
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,463
Bowling, for example, seems a natural Ht.

14
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,424
Bowling is a sport, Lee.

15
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,211
How about horse-racing?

16
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,132
Lee, Lee, the jockey smokes the cigarette.

17
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,263
Did either of you ladies
bring any ice with you?

18
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,808
We're sorting out the focus group for Pond's
and I haven't gotten the hypothesis,

19
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,888
in writing anyway.

20
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:37,973
He said, "Don."

21
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,149
We'll do our best. Peggy, write it up.

22
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,438
You haven't okayed the brief.

23
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,649
I liked your idea. I liked it a lot.

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,283
The mirror one or the cleansing one?

25
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,742
What's the mirror one?

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,583
Well, I think it's about the ritual,
the multiple applications, indulgence.

27
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,914
Pond's is the only cold cream that allows me

28
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,462
to stare at myself in the mirror
for 20 minutes

29
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,039
and feel good and not vain.

30
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,376
That's very good.

31
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,555
So, we're talking about girls, 18 to 25.

32
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,848
Can I grab a few from around here?

33
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,221
Yeah, help yourself.

34
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,052
See, I would never buy a sailboat.

35
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,263
I don't want to do things myself.

36
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,186
For that price,
that boat should have a motor.

37
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,899
A what?

38
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,946
-One of those, too.
-Anything else?

39
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,202
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Don about that?

40
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,409
I have to go to the little boys' room.

41
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:38,375
I'm sorry, Lee,
can you go through that one more time?

42
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,123
That's the Lucky Strike call?
Why wasn't I told?

43
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,129
Be happy. I saved you an ass-ache.

44
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,761
So what's so bad he couldn't tell me?

45
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,346
Cal Rutledge from Chesebrough-Pond's
has a wild hair about Clearasil.

46
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,059
He thinks they're in conflict.

47
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,141
Pimple cream and cold cream?

48
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,437
A rather broad definition.

49
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,394
Does it matter?

50
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,568
Look, Pete, we're going to have
to resign the Clearasil account.

51
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,409
-Why?
-Lane.

52
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,327
It can't be up for debate.

53
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:18,158
Clearasil is worth $1.25 million in billings,
and Pond's over two.

54
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,082
No.

55
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,918
You know what it took
to get my father-in-law

56
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,415
to join this new firm to begin with?

57
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:29,131
Fifteen percent of $750,000 is near $113,000.

58
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,379
Roger, I don't expect him
to understand this,

59
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,466
but do you have any idea
of what I've had to do to keep that account?

60
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,176
The personal toll I've paid?

61
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,355
I do, but you've been good to him,
remember that, sales-wise.

62
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,190
-Mr. Sterling?
-I don't believe this.

63
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,645
-Roger.
-Throw yourself on a grenade.

64
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,069
Protect the agency. You're a partner now.

65
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,446
This evening if you can.

66
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,665
Over half this agency
is dedicated to your needs,

67
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,742
but if you want to get into the line-by-line

68
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,543
of the costs we've billed for,

69
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,088
I'll have Lane Pryce
at the foot of your bed in 20 minutes.

70
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,216
Oh, my God, there's some kind of fire.

71
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,961
Right down by Radio City.

72
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,471
Roger, we should go. Sorry, Lee.

73
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,801
We gotta go. Okay, bye-bye.

74
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,399
Should I type all this up?

75
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,312
Yes. And remind me
to remind Caroline to tell Lane

76
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,739
that Lucky Strike noticed
that they're being billed

77
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,192
for all the work we do
for everybody else at this agency.

78
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,786
You know what? I don't want that on paper.

79
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,036
-Who is that?
-A dear friend.

80
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,588
Is that the letter from California?

81
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,002
Yes.

82
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,145
-I hate this office.
-You wanted to be close to Roger.

83
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,932
Make yourself at home, why don't you?

84
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,729
Did you see Sunday's paper?

85
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,271
If this is about the Playtex ad
they keep complaining about,

86
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,272
I've been told
the printer swapped paper stocks.

87
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,324
And I don't care
if she looks like a Puerto Rican.

88
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,742
Puerto Rican girls buy brassieres.

89
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,828
Not that they need to.

90
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:24,579
I saw this one on the subway
in one of those striped Jean Seberg shirts,

91
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,706
red rag in her hair, nipples...

92
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,292
I'm not in the mood. What do you want?

93
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,212
-Cosgrove's getting married.
-So?

94
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,178
He took us to the opera last month,
great seats, and now I know why.

95
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,925
It turns out her father shits gold ingots.

96
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,422
What does he do?

97
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,142
CFO of Corning.

98
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,343
My father-in-law's a bus driver.

99
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,099
The only place he can take me
is to the moon.

100
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,015
Ken's the competition.
Why are you going to the opera with him?

101
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,356
Geyer is twice our size,
and we're friends, aren't we?

102
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:52,895
Friends.

103
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,739
Why are you always looking for a job?

104
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,823
What?

105
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,486
Look, Pete.

106
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,994
There's a group of us,
we're all coming up together.

107
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,700
You don't think Kenny's a comer?

108
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,002
You know he has Mountain Dew?
That's Pepsi.

109
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,632
We're having lunch tomorrow. Tag along.
He always asks about you.

110
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,254
Of course he does.

111
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,845
Worst case, Kenny'll brag too much
and you can steal a client from him.

112
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,277
Hello.

113
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,947
I'm sorry. That looks like bad news.

114
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,623
It's not mine. I'm Joyce.
I work at Life, assistant photo editor.

115
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:51,037
Peggy Olson, Sterling Cooper
Draper Pryce, copywriter.

116
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,087
Really?

117
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,798
Life magazine, I love the photos.

118
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,297
Well, you'll never see these.

119
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,466
I have to admit I'd be shocked.

120
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,012
He's my friend, and my boss hates nudes.

121
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,391
Who hates nudes?

122
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,479
That's a beautiful one.

123
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,734
I'm going to the mailroom.
Peggy, right? 37th floor?

124
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,337
Tom, you're 15 minutes early.

125
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,256
So are you. Sit down.

126
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,508
We can eat anytime or not at all.

127
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,889
Excuse me. Dewar's on the rocks.

128
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,597
What's so important?

129
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,144
Tom, how are you feeling?

130
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,688
Couldn't be better.

131
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,152
I hope you know I've always done my best
to make you happy.

132
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,361
I do.

133
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,994
And there's no reason,
as far as I'm concerned,

134
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,873
that there should be any change in the way
that we deal with each other.

135
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,045
Tom, I...

136
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,875
This is very hard for me to say.

137
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,635
I honestly don't know how
you're going to take this

138
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,429
and it's been very hard to separate

139
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,098
our business relationship
from the rest of our life,

140
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,846
but they should be separate.

141
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,682
You are some kind of high WASP, all right.

142
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,731
-Look, I can't keep this up.
-Keep what up?

143
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,934
I heard.

144
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,192
You know?

145
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,235
You crazy kid.

146
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,404
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,871
Jeannie was with Trudy at the doctor.
Congratulations!

148
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,411
What?

149
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,919
Oh, shit.

150
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,298
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

151
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:09,008
It was Monday, for crying out loud.
Why hasn't she told you?

152
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,226
I don't know.

153
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,388
Well, it may be her news,
but it is good news.

154
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,852
You can't tell her that I told you. You can't.

155
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,896
I'm going to be a father?

156
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,113
Can you believe it?

157
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,904
-I'm going to be a father.
-Yeah.

158
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,788
I feel like my heart's going to burst.

159
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:39,588
Champagne right here. Bring a bottle.
We're going to tie one on.

160
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:43,462
If it's a boy, it's $1 ,000, a girl, $500.

161
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,418
I'll do what I can do.

162
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,342
You really can't tell Trudy.

163
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,470
I don't know howl let the cat out of the bag.

164
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,431
I thought you knew
what I was talking about.

165
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,104
-What did you think I was talking about?
-What?

166
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,106
Why did you have to see me?

167
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,814
I just wanted to...

168
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,897
We're putting new creative on Clearasil.

169
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,023
Fine. Who cares?

170
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,820
May you know this feeling many times.

171
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,742
I only had the one,

172
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,999
and I love her to death,
but I wish we'd had more.

173
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,713
Jeannie had her uterus removed,
some kind of a cyst or something.

174
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,592
Trudy!

175
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,314
I'm sick, Peter. I'm so sick about this.

176
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,939
Daddy just called me from a pay phone,
drunk and in tears.

177
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:47,397
I know what you think. I just wanted to wait
till our anniversary to tell you.

178
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,575
I don't care, Trudy.

179
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,534
I don't care how I heard.

180
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,623
Peter.

181
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,835
How did this happen?
What did the doctor say?

182
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,883
He said I was going to have a baby.

183
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,634
I want to pick you up and spin you around,

184
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,637
but I don't want
to damage anything in there.

185
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,385
I'm so happy you're happy.

186
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,772
I don't know.
It feels much different than I expected.

187
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,683
How would you know what this feels like?

188
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,570
Come, get off your feet.

189
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,116
How are you feeling?

190
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,743
Tell me you'll forgive my father.

191
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,742
They already think you hate them
and honestly, it's my fault.

192
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,990
I don't hate them.

193
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,247
I shouldn't have taken my mother
to the doctor, not that doctor.

194
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,500
It's just...
I thought something was going on,

195
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,252
and I was so prepared to be disappointed

196
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,629
or that, God forbid,
something was really wrong.

197
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,589
Trudy, I had to talk to him
because the agency has to drop Clearasil.

198
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,475
-Why?
-There's another product that's similar,

199
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,686
-and we can't...
-A conflict.

200
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,763
Peter, I'm familiar with the term.
You use it all the time.

201
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,022
I invited him there
and his good news trumped my bad news.

202
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,570
And the funny thing is,
that was the moment to tell him.

203
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,569
I was so bowled over.

204
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,078
We did it.

205
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,876
Why don't you
let my father hear this from me?

206
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:27,081
He's already so guilty,
he'll never feel the knife go in.

207
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,756
I can't let you do that.

208
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,552
But I'm the one who talked him
into returning to the agency to begin with.

209
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,255
-We needed him.
-And now you don't.

210
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,932
He'll be fine. Tomorrow night.

211
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,552
Yankee pot roast.

212
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,896
Let's go.
Caroline will be watching your desk.

213
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,863
Why don't you have to do this?

214
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,529
You don't have to do this.
You're getting paid.

215
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,158
We're old and we're married.
They don't want us.

216
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,706
But I use Pond's. I do.

217
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,782
Come on.

218
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,671
Girls, rind your places.
Megan, help me with the curtains.

219
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,346
No matter how late I come,
I'm always waiting for someone.

220
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,106
I had to wait until the girls
left the ladies' room to change.

221
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,687
You could've used my office,
but I don't have one.

222
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,943
-This isn't right.
-I thought you wanted Faye, not Dr. Miller.

223
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:43,202
Yes, but I told someone
to leave the "e" off of Faye.

224
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,251
I like to be able to correct it in front
of the girls. It makes them trust me.

225
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,669
Because your name is spelled wrong?

226
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,540
Because I'm obviously not that important.
I don't need it.

227
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,968
I have to warn you there's lots of perfume.

228
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,387
There always is.

229
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,987
...why everyone has a nifty name tag.

230
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,784
Very well then.
I suppose I'll work in Mr. Sterling's office.

231
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,243
He won't be coming.

232
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,954
As I said, my name is Faye.

233
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,825
I don't have a name tag.

234
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,451
I guess they forgot about me.

235
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,507
They got mine wrong. I'm Dotty.

236
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,128
I mean I'm not a dotty person.
That's my name.

237
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,305
Hello, Dotty.

238
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,719
So, there's no reason to be anxious.

239
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,939
We have to enjoy the fact that we're all
getting paid not to work for a little bit.

240
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,399
But don't worry, that's our little secret.

241
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,240
And I'd like you to think that this is
just a bunch of your friends,

242
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:06,119
as if maybe this is a sorority
or a bridal shower with tea.

243
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:12,955
Or just a bunch of us celebrating, say
Allison 's birthday at my apartment.

244
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,378
You shouldn't be surprised,
looking around the room,

245
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,966
that we're here to talk about beauty.

246
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,605
What are the things we all do
to keep ourselves beautiful

247
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,728
or simply to enhance it?

248
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,475
Please pass a Danish.

249
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,399
You don't have to raise your hand. Anyone?

250
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,618
I can say it.

251
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,862
I have a routine.

252
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:51,084
I brush my hair 100 times
just like I did when I was a little girl,

253
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,833
but of course only the night
before I have it set.

254
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,046
-Very cute.
-Can you imagine?

255
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:05,007
Your financial future's in the hands
of a roomful of 22-year-old girls.

256
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,470
Not mine.

257
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,852
Okay. Sometimes I watch my weight.

258
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,521
No one's hungry?

259
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,361
I'd like a Danish.

260
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,781
I don't use Pond's,
if that's what you're asking.

261
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,280
That's okay.

262
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,458
I'm of French extraction
and my mother has beautiful skin.

263
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,785
She never washes her face.

264
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,712
She's not dirty.
She uses water, but nothing else.

265
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,332
And you do what she does?

266
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,713
What does she do?

267
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,304
She stands at the sink

268
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:49,384
and she runs the water until it's
just the perfect temperature, not too hot.

269
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:54,598
And she splashes it on her face
and she pats her cheeks with her fingertips.

270
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,226
And she looks at herself?

271
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,441
Yes, she does.

272
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,318
She's amazing.

273
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:13,408
I sit at my vanity and I have this night cream,
my boyfriend laughed at me.

274
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,585
What was so funny about it?

275
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,583
It was just, you know, one time.

276
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,009
At Christmas Eve we were staying up late
and we were playing house, I guess.

277
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,006
You shouldn't do things for them.
They don't appreciate it.

278
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,929
You don't think
they appreciate you being beautiful?

279
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,891
We broke up a year ago.

280
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,151
Actually, I don't know what he noticed,
but it wasn't me, I guess.

281
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,649
It's worse when they notice, sometimes.

282
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,274
Allison, please, continue.

283
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,115
It's nothing.

284
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,168
-Are you in there?
-Yes.

285
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,175
I asked your girl to inform me of your arrival.

286
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,757
She's in that group.

287
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,804
Did you speak with Tom?

288
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,517
I'm sorry. It didn't happen.
The opportunity passed.

289
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,972
Well, then we shall endeavor to recreate it.
Perhaps lunch today?

290
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,192
I'm afraid Roger's already informed Pond's
that this was attended to.

291
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,895
That's sloppy.

292
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,989
I have a lunch, but I'm seeing him tonight.

293
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,607
Damn it.

294
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,327
Lane.

295
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,166
I just found out I'm going to be a father.

296
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,995
Well, now, that should
take the sting out of all of this.

297
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,922
I suppose.

298
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,002
I apologize.

299
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,176
That's the very best news.

300
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,842
Congratulations.

301
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,894
Thank you.

302
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:12,319
And I just kept thinking,
"Why does he stare at other girls?"

303
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,533
Well, men do that,
but does he look at me that way?

304
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,046
And we're not married, so who am I?

305
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:26,670
How the hell did this get so sad so fast?

306
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,173
I know I'm speaking for everyone here.

307
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,133
But you can't think it has anything to do
with how you look, Dotty.

308
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,894
You can only do your best
with what God gave you.

309
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,185
What about makeup?

310
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:46,064
I feel like it doesn't matter what I see.

311
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,899
It matters what he sees.

312
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,364
I feel like I gave him everything
and I got nothing.

313
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,532
I could see she was gonna crack.

314
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,367
Allison?

315
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,835
Are you all right, dear?

316
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,545
-It's okay. She'll be all right.
-Should I...

317
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,671
If she wanted to be around us,
she would've stayed.

318
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,102
Sarah, what do you do that makes you feel
good about the way you look?

319
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,271
I feel kind of responsible. Do you mind?

320
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,436
Is there any kind of ritual?

321
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,447
I think my strategy was right.

322
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,571
They just wanna get married
and they'll buy anything that'll help.

323
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,458
-Are you all right?
-it's you.

324
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,919
Come with me.

325
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,096
People cry in these things all the time.
Grown men.

326
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,470
I was in a bunch
when I first started working here.

327
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,722
I'd say half the time somebody cries.

328
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,179
Really?

329
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,681
I think it just feels good to talk.

330
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,272
I can't even say anything
because I know he's right out there,

331
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,728
right through the glass.

332
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,280
Who?

333
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,824
I don't know how you stand it.

334
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,406
The way he turns on the charm one minute
and then yanks it away.

335
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,871
How can you even talk to him?

336
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,662
Don?

337
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,242
Would you stop it?

338
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,000
I realize you must've gone through
everything I've gone through.

339
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,875
But now I know. It's just, he's a drunk.

340
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,006
And they get away with murder
because they forget everything.

341
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,049
I don't know what you think.

342
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,427
Forget it.

343
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,017
Your problem is not my problem.

344
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,396
-Fine.
-And honestly, you should get over it.

345
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,440
Please leave me alone.

346
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,448
-Thank you. Nice to meet you, too.
-Nice to meet you.

347
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,201
-Bye.
-Bye.

348
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,996
-Did she go home?
-No, she's fine.

349
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,244
Nothing else good happened.

350
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,037
-Bye, now.
-Okay, great.

351
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,121
Bye-bye.

352
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,379
That went very well.

353
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,219
You can stop the tape.

354
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,632
Is she okay?

355
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,718
-Who?
-Yeah, she's fine.

356
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,061
All right. Let's talk preliminary results.

357
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,437
Is it all right
if we put this back the way it goes?

358
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,563
We can go to my office.

359
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,482
Let's go in there.

360
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,623
That's big, big news.

361
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,671
If you need any baby crap,
Jen and I have a closetful.

362
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,301
-Hello, fellows.
-Good to see you, Kenny.

363
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,549
-Pete.
-How are you, Ken?

364
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,266
-Mr. Crane.
-Over here, Gil.

365
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,097
There's a phone call for you.

366
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,394
I've gotta get this. Those goniffs
at CBS are screwing me again.

367
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,939
-Those what?
-Order for me, Caesar salad, no dressing.

368
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,944
-You wanna take a look?
-Sure.

369
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,751
Listen, I've gotta get this out of the way.

370
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,747
But I would appreciate it for the future

371
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,049
if you would not say shitty things
about me behind my back.

372
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,593
What?

373
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,966
Come on.
Are you gonna deny it and make it worse?

374
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,131
I don't know what you've heard,
but it's not true.

375
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,519
You didn't call me an All-American idiot
who fell into everything?

376
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,764
Whom did I supposedly say this to?

377
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,307
Does it matter?

378
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,068
Well, I'd like to defend myself.

379
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,946
I heard that you told your wife
that I was driving the tractor

380
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,068
when the accident happened.

381
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,492
What? I don't think so.

382
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:06,741
What I probably said was
that you were involved,

383
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,289
we all were, and that it was your account.

384
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,871
And Crane told me yesterday
you said I was marrying for money.

385
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,833
I didn't say that. He did.

386
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,373
Well, he's like that,
and everybody who knows him knows that.

387
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,086
But when you say it, and especially
when it gets back to my fiancee,

388
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,671
Trudy knows her, you know,
some garden club.

389
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,466
I was unaware of that.

390
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,469
Look, you know what?

391
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,186
I apologize. Mea culpa.

392
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,394
Textbook Harry.

393
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:41,155
You know what? He's buying lunch.

394
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,866
I don't really care.
I'm just glad to be out of the office.

395
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:48,075
It is nice, especially without having to listen

396
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,282
to some client yammering
about how dirty the city is.

397
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,621
How's it going?

398
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,796
I've been floating along laterally,
but I don't know that it's a love affair.

399
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,090
-It's better than McCann.
-What was that like?

400
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:04,178
Are you kidding me? it's the worst agency
I've ever seen. The worst.

401
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,177
My mother was a nurse
at the state hospital in Vermont

402
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,760
and that was the last time I saw
so many retarded people in one building.

403
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,525
So, you're getting married. Congratulations.

404
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,694
It's all that really matters, right?

405
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,654
Actually, I have a bit of news of my own.

406
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,736
Trudy is with child.

407
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,910
Good for you. Good for you.

408
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,332
I'll be honest, I can't wait.

409
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,286
It's very good so far.

410
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,715
A new family, a new agency,
has to be exciting.

411
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,757
Well, you know, wherever you do this job,
you're doing this job.

412
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,385
I know you're all slaves to Draper over there,

413
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:52,469
but I'd rather be a slave to creative
than some old fart.

414
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,849
Whoever pours the last drink
gets all the credit

415
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,272
and you're spinning your wheels
half the time.

416
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,026
Right now we're chasing Mountain Dew.

417
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,399
Supposedly we're going
to turn it into Pepsi,

418
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,733
but the only reason Pepsi would do it
is to make BBDO sweat.

419
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,865
This whole idea that
we'd get the bigger company is a joke.

420
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,992
We'd just end up
with a bunch of little pieces.

421
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,499
Well, the grass is always greener.

422
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:24,254
Who am I kidding? Look how lucky we are.

423
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:28,380
Another Campbell,
that's just what the world needs.

424
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,153
-Can I come in?
-It's your office.

425
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,190
Glad to see you're feeling better.

426
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,951
If you don't feel like working...

427
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,211
What?

428
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,259
I'm very embarrassed.

429
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,008
People cry in those groups
all the time, Allison.

430
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,509
That's not what I'm embarrassed about.

431
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,267
This actually happened.

432
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,274
I know.

433
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,062
I know.

434
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,193
We made a mistake

435
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:36,243
and I feel like it's awkward
and it's better for both of us if I move on.

436
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,742
I don't think that's necessary.
We're both adults.

437
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,878
No, I really would feel better about it.

438
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,207
A friend of mine told me
about a job at a magazine

439
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,716
and I thought that might be interesting,
working for a woman.

440
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,423
Anyway, I...

441
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,811
I would appreciate it
if you could write me a recommendation.

442
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,476
Absolutely.
What would probably be even better

443
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:04,399
is if you type up whatever you want
and I'll sign it.

444
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:06,894
What?

445
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,612
You've been sparkling in your duties.

446
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,406
Just put it on my stationery,
put whatever you want and I'll sign it.

447
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:30,217
I don't say this easily,
but you're not a good person.

448
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:35,589
Allison, hold on.

449
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,028
What's going on?

450
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,743
I'm gonna need a new secretary.
And this cleaned up.

451
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,163
Would you be open
to Allison returning in a couple of days?

452
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,754
-If that's what she wants.
-Really?

453
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,748
No.

454
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,489
There's a Joyce Ramsay
to see you at reception.

455
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,533
So, at this point
you've read everything out here?

456
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:45,913
I don't even like magazines,

457
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,792
but I brought in a book
and they told me it didn't look right.

458
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,330
Hi.

459
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,425
Do you want
to come back and see my office?

460
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,293
Another time.

461
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:59,632
Listen, my friend the photographer,
Mr. Reject, he's having a...

462
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,763
I don't even know what to call it, downtown.

463
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,345
Are you inviting me?

464
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,564
-Are you afraid of the subway?
-Of course not.

465
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,029
Thanks, sweetheart.

466
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,355
Washington Market,

467
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:20,069
unless you have to work
or have plans that are more interesting.

468
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,996
It starts at 9:00. I'll be there at 10:00.

469
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,374
She's kind of pretentious.

470
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,671
I know.

471
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,640
Darling, we're so excited.

472
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,717
Is that you, Peter?

473
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:45,973
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut from now on.

474
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,357
Well, hello there.

475
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,277
-How are you feeling?
-A little behind.

476
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,105
Why don't you let me
fix my father and you a drink

477
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,816
and you can show my mother
what we have planned for the maid's room.

478
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,363
I'll make the drinks. I don't care.

479
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,535
No, why don't you show
your mother the maid's room?

480
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,284
I don't know that I'm an expert.

481
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,701
Okay.

482
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,912
Come along, Mother.

483
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,037
We're a couple of lucky ducks, aren't we?

484
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,840
We are. Tom, let me ask you something.

485
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,342
-What are you having?
-In a minute. Listen...

486
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,590
I know what you're gonna say.

487
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:22,764
You need a bigger apartment. I get it.

488
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:26,181
Every time you jump to conclusions,
Tom, you make me respect you less.

489
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,261
-What?
-LOOK.

490
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,022
You gave us Clearasil
and we're extremely grateful,

491
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:32,941
but there's only so much business
it's going to do.

492
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,401
Yeah, well, that's kind of in your hands,
isn't it?

493
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,108
I'm done auditioning.

494
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,195
You gave us this under a certain pretext.

495
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,275
I've done well by you.

496
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,454
And the idea was
if we do well by this account,

497
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,247
you'll give us a shot at the big one,

498
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:50,075
because right now
I have bigger business than Clearasil.

499
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,868
Are you mad at me?

500
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,837
No.

501
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,165
Clearasil was conflicted out
by a bigger company,

502
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,671
and I'm trying to build a business here.

503
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,296
Well, what do you want?
Do you want the cough syrup?

504
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,009
I want all of it.

505
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:09,471
I want the formula 44 mixture,
the cough drops, the inhaler, vaporub.

506
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,773
Who's doing a better job
for you than I have?

507
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,772
Well, you've given me
something to think about.

508
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,028
Really?

509
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,320
I think it's pretty simple. What can I get you?

510
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,616
Trudy, do we have any ice?

511
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,617
You son of a bitch.

512
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,130
Tom, you have to come see this.

513
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:44,314
Joyce!

514
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,280
I made it.

515
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,698
You look swellegant.

516
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,696
Okay.

517
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,827
Peggy works in the same building.

518
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:56,251
Sharon was one of Davey's models.

519
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,837
What did your mother say?

520
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,710
She doesn't know.

521
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,125
What is that?

522
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,259
He screws around with movies, too.
He's not as good at it.

523
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:11,183
I can't believe how big this place is.

524
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,305
I think it was a sweatshop.

525
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,731
Is there beer or something?
I thought I saw someone with a beer.

526
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,440
Jesus. I thought I needed a lot of attention.

527
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:30,111
Listen, I'm already high,
but this is easier than finding a beer.

528
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:31,991
If you like it.

529
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,743
I love it.

530
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,845
I'm hungry.

531
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,472
I have a boyfriend.

532
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,058
He doesn't own your vagina.

533
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,348
No, but he's renting it.

534
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,434
This film is more interesting than I thought.

535
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,059
-it's rhythmic.
-Yeah.

536
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,687
I thought I was gonna get to meet him.

537
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,572
Abe!

538
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,194
Where the hell's Kellogg?

539
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,825
Hey, Abe. Are you with Joyce?

540
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,118
Are you?

541
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,920
-I'm Peggy.
-Peggy's a writer.

542
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,748
So am I. What do you write?

543
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,583
I'm a Copywriter.

544
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,342
But what do you write?

545
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,215
That is writing.

546
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,051
You're not working on something else?

547
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,263
Davey Kellogg, this is Peggy Olson.

548
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,887
-She wanted to meet you.
-I'm Catholic.

549
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,721
So, you like it?

550
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,267
I don't think I'm supposed to.

551
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,398
I love your nudes.
We're looking for photographers.

552
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,447
-I'm glad I was here to see this.
-Who's "we"?

553
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,113
I work at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Advertising.

554
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,616
Why would I ever do that?

555
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,452
So you can get paid to practice your art.

556
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,996
Art in advertising?

557
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,328
Why would anyone do that after Warhol?

558
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:32,126
Sorry, for somebody to sell their soul,
they've got to have one.

559
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,171
It's a raid!

560
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,473
It's the NYPD.

561
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,510
Wait, wait.

562
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,234
-Hey, come on. Come on.
-Nobody move!

563
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,950
You know, I've been arrested before.

564
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,653
For what?

565
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:05,664
I was writing about this boycott in Harlem
and they wouldn't leave, so I didn't leave.

566
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,211
Wow! Did you go to jail?

567
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,168
No.

568
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,833
My sister came and got me.

569
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,180
I feel like I should kiss you.

570
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,980
Come on.

571
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,953
They chased everybody
down the fire escape.

572
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,033
Are they beating people?

573
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,368
They took the film.

574
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,337
I should see this. It could be a story.

575
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,255
-How can I find you?
-I know where she is.

576
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:25,621
Nice to see you, Ms. Blankenship.

577
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:28,579
I look forward to hearing that every day.

578
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:32,629
There's coffee and a roll on your desk
and Mr. Sterling would like to see you.

579
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,005
Roger, he's here.

580
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,546
Could you get the others?

581
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,179
Blankenship? Boy!

582
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:50,640
Hello? Could you fetch Campbell
and Pryce, Lane, Misters.

583
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,604
What did you do
to make them take her out of mothballs?

584
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,060
She was working in Cooper's apartment.

585
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,445
Allison found a better opportunity.

586
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,113
Do you know he works without pants?

587
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,232
-Morning, Don.
-Don.

588
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,867
Morning.

589
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,195
I'd like to say
in front of this informal partners meeting

590
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:09,203
that I am in the midst of signing
Vicks Chemical, the entire cough line.

591
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,580
It bills at around $6 million
and they love television.

592
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,627
It's truly spectacular news.

593
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,792
Congratulations. How'd you swing that?

594
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:19,669
I guess as the president would say,
I turned chicken shit into chicken salad.

595
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,378
I thought I'd kick Clearasil over to Geyer.

596
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,254
Anyone but Chaough.

597
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,592
We're taking Philip Coakmeyer
and Tom Vogel to luncheon today.

598
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,435
Don't worry,
we already checked it with your girl.

599
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,141
-Keep it up.
-Thank you, Don.

600
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,322
Please reschedule Dr. Miller.

601
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:49,748
They're not really pornography, per se.
They're just nudes.

602
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,783
They're like renaissance paintings.

603
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:55,955
The party sounds fun.
We had nude models in school.

604
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,335
You know right away whoever
has the best drawing is going to get her.

605
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,004
Did you know Malcolm X
was shot last Sunday?

606
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,718
Yes, Peggy.

607
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,712
Well, did you know who he was?

608
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,345
You ever read the stuff between the ads?

609
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,972
A few of us are sending
a bottle of champagne to the Campbells'.

610
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,644
I'll sign the card.

611
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,893
-I was hoping for a contribution.
-No, thank you.

612
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,695
Trudy's pregnant?

613
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,486
I can't believe that guy's married to her.

614
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,997
I would get her so pregnant.

615
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,388
Hello.

616
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,721
Congratulations.

617
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,769
Yes.

618
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,393
A $6 million account
should shut Lane up for a while.

619
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,890
No, I mean about the baby.

620
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,772
Yes. I guess that's news.

621
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,902
I just wanted to let you know
how happy I am for you both.

622
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,243
Thank you.

623
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:49,242
Dr. Miller is here to see you. It's a she.

624
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,619
Send her in.

625
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:02,335
-What do you want?
-Nothing. I moved the meeting.

626
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,754
Your secretary said
you needed to see me immediately.

627
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,798
We're still working things out.

628
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:14,467
Well, I've done everything
but finish the report.

629
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:16,469
How'd we do?

630
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,644
Well, it turns out
the hypothesis was rejected.

631
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:24,853
I'd recommend a strategy that links
Pond's Cold Cream to matrimony,

632
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:27,105
a veiled promise.

633
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,902
Hello, 1925.

634
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,828
I'm not gonna do that,
so what are we gonna tell the client?

635
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,994
I can't change the truth.

636
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,293
How do you know that's the truth?

637
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,166
A new idea is something
they don't know yet,

638
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,714
so of course it's not gonna
come up as an option.

639
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,382
Put my campaign on IV for a year,

640
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,585
then hold your group again,
maybe it'll show up.

641
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,931
Well, I tried everything.
I said, "Routine." I tried "ritual."

642
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,427
All they care about is a husband.

643
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,180
You were there.
I'll show you the transcripts.

644
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:58,428
You can't tell
how people are going to behave

645
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,184
based on how they have behaved.

646
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,481
Why are you being so hostile?

647
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,025
You think I've never had
this argument before?

648
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,069
Because you go in there
and you stick your finger in people's brains

649
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,864
and they just start talking...
Just to be heard.

650
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,441
And you know what?

651
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:15,404
Not only does it have nothing to do
with what I do, but it's nobody's business.

652
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,789
Well, you're the client.

653
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,158
That's right.

654
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,476
-Hello.
-It's Joyce.

655
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,149
Lunch, five minutes.

656
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:46,976
Sure.

657
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,734
-Meet you in the lobby?
-No, my friends want to see Megan.

658
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,159
-Pete, you remember Phil Coakmeyer.
-A pleasure to see you again.

659
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,323
Shall we?

660
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:02,075
We're just waiting on Don.

661
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:12,460
Hi.

662
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,926
-You wanna join us?
-I can't.

663
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,843
Did you get pears?

664
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,061
Did you get pears?

665
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,732
Did you get pears?

666
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,647
We'll discuss it inside.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
