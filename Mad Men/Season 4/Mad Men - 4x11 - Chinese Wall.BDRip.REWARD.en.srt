1
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,088
I have sand in the weirdest places.

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,091
Jones Beach? Don't be so sure it's sand.

3
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,557
Hold up. We got hitchers.

4
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,476
Made it.

5
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,599
I see that.

6
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,059
Hey.

7
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,270
Hi.

8
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,025
Girls, on the hop.

9
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,282
You gotta get up.

10
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,373
All I want to say is I did not plan this.

11
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,792
Nobody talk. I'm really stoned.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,626
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,004
You weigh, like, a pound or less.

14
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,057
I see you went in.

15
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,263
I like the water.

16
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,473
Can I quote you on that?

17
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,018
I'm learning.

18
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,193
My God. You're a slob.

19
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,995
We have to be quiet. I have a roommate.

20
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,349
God, I love your shoulders.

21
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,426
You look like you're in the Olympics.

22
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,017
You never stop talking.

23
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,271
It was like the movies.

24
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,604
One minute we're listening
to a lecture on rhododendrons,

25
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,156
and the next, Patricia is driving
like a speed racer to the hospital.

26
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,108
And Trudy keeps apologizing
in the back seat,

27
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:34,288
and we're saying, "it's okay. Nobody cares.
You're having a baby!"

28
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,788
Meanwhile, Campbell's on the back nine
with his father-in-law, who's also a client.

29
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,294
That's a nice way to end a round.

30
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,963
Ken Cosgrove. Don't get up.

31
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,207
John Flory.

32
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,302
This is my fiancÃ©e, Cynthia,
Her parents, Ed and Lillian Baxter.

33
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,470
-Sorry to interrupt.
-It's a pleasure.

34
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,717
Nice to meet you.

35
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,100
Aren't you lucky?
I'm spending my Sunday night with Dodge.

36
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,554
Nice to see you, Ken. And, listen, I'm sorry
about, you know... My condolences.

37
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,476
David Montgomery?

38
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,058
I was only there for about six months.
I didn't really know him.

39
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,065
Right.

40
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,322
Well, I should be on my way.
It was nice meeting you all.

41
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,865
Flory.

42
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,908
Look, you're with your family.
I shouldn't have said anything.

43
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,205
You didn't. What's going on?

44
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,330
Lucky Strike. They're coming over to us.

45
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,332
What?

46
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,669
Look, you didn't hear it from me, okay?

47
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,843
-You're winding me up.
-No.

48
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,514
American Tobacco came in last Monday,
said they're moving all the brands to us.

49
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,384
Well, that's not true.

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,104
Someone should tell Lee Garner, Jr. that.

51
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,477
Sorry.

52
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,950
You okay, son?

53
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,528
Whenever ad men meet,
all they do is brag and brag,

54
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,989
and it's hard not to get rattled.

55
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,785
Ed, Lillian, you'll have to excuse me.

56
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,914
Sweetheart, I swear to you I wouldn't do this
if it wasn't serious.

57
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,389
Ken! What a pleasant surprise!

58
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,091
There's nothing much to celebrate yet.

59
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,889
They were going to send Trudy home,
but her mother protested.

60
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,221
I sent her for food just to get rid of her.

61
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,228
Anyway, I suppose your visit is premature.

62
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,776
-I shouldn't use that word around here.
-Can I talk to you?

63
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,783
John Flory, some prick over at BBDO,
just told me that Lucky Strike is going there.

64
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,201
What?

65
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,956
You made me wait for you while you worked.

66
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,625
I'm not waiting anymore.

67
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,374
I should get it.

68
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,336
Of course. The kids.

69
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,339
-Hello?
-it's Pete.

70
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,512
Have you heard anything about
Lucky Strike leaving?

71
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,759
No.

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,679
Ken heard from somebody at BBDO
that Lucky's coming over.

73
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,682
-Bullshit. Call Roger.
-I did. He's out.

74
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,390
Wake Cooper. Meet me in the office.

75
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,858
What happened?

76
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:10,481
I'm not sure.

77
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,862
I have to make a call.

78
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:15,695
Hello?

79
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,861
What's going on?

80
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,490
Ken here heard that Lucky Strike is leaving.

81
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,915
That they've already left.

82
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,288
What? Who told you that?

83
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,460
John Flory.

84
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,039
He's an account executive at BBDO.
That's where they're going.

85
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,132
-No. That's impossible.
-Call him.

86
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,552
I'm telling you, it's impossible.

87
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,138
Don't lose your temper.

88
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,061
Somebody call Lane in London?

89
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,101
Yeah, I don't think he'll go back to sleep.

90
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,932
Could I get a drink?

91
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,073
It's ringing.

92
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,363
Lee.

93
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,575
Roger Sterling. From your agency.

94
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,824
Well, it's serious.

95
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,245
He's drunk.

96
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,919
You're damn right I heard.

97
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,918
Because you can consolidate
your business here.

98
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,968
Just because your father's
non compos mentis

99
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,971
doesn't mean you have to
listen to the board.

100
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,310
It's bullshit! Lee!

101
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,934
Thirty years!

102
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,312
I have to hear it on the street?

103
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,109
No review? Nothing?

104
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,409
He hung up.

105
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,956
It's true?

106
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,962
I need to sit down.

107
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,887
Tomorrow morning, we're getting on
the 6:00 a.m. to Raleigh-Durham.

108
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,305
I'll do it.

109
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,887
I've known him half my life.

110
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,806
I need a drink.

111
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,660
What time is it?

112
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,987
Midnight.

113
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,657
You want one?

114
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,494
Looks like you need both.

115
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,004
It looks like Lucky Strike
might have gone south.

116
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,723
Holy crap.

117
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,017
Obviously, we'd like to avoid
that information getting out.

118
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,100
What happened?

119
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:56,227
Supposedly, they're consolidating
for a reduced commission at BBDO.

120
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,066
Hey, watch it. You have to keep a clear head.

121
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,578
Every day, I tried not to think about
what would happen if this happened.

122
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,546
Look at that plum.

123
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,546
What's that?

124
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,681
That face.

125
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,391
You're the most hirable man
on Madison Avenue.

126
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,518
I'm not at that point yet.

127
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:36,941
Okay.

128
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,462
How's Trudy?

129
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,415
Her mother's got her all worked up.

130
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:03,961
She made such a stink.
And that thing's at least another day away.

131
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,012
Can I see her?

132
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,304
Have you been drinking?

133
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,259
You need to calm down.

134
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,349
I was at a ballgame when Trudy was born.

135
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,351
Go about your business.

136
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,234
Are you all right?

137
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,785
Could I speak with you candidly?

138
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,204
Always.

139
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,748
I'd like to think I'm more to you
than a typical father-in-law.

140
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,827
You are. That's the problem.
It's about business.

141
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,497
There's no business in here, son.

142
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,467
We may have lost Lucky Strike.

143
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,215
I'm sure this agency was a thrill,
but you've had your folly.

144
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,554
That's not right, Tom.

145
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,725
I haven't stayed at Vick Chemical
for 28 years because I love it.

146
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,523
It's because I have a family.
And any minute here, you will, too.

147
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,565
This still can work.

148
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,689
I'm not rooting against you.

149
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,647
You've got my account, for God's sake.
It's just...

150
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,035
You're a frequent topic at CGC.

151
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,954
Now, apparently,
you were a tough act to follow

152
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,246
when we moved Clearasil over there.

153
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,450
Ted Chaough? I hate him.

154
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,705
He's a good guy.

155
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,337
He's not interested in me.
He's just trying to hobble Don.

156
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,416
There's no reward
in going down with the ship.

157
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,635
I have an agency. I'm a partner.

158
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,755
I found him.

159
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,554
He was down at the candy machines,
dozed off.

160
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,850
-Can I see her?
-No.

161
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,974
She finally went to sleep.

162
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,314
Why don't you just go back
to the candy machines and we'll wait.

163
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,313
I'm sorry about that.

164
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,486
Well, the air conditioning guy's
supposed to be there at 8:00.

165
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,704
I guess I'll see you, then.

166
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,833
You don't want me to go?

167
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,508
I want you to do whatever you usually do.

168
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,054
Hey, I don't usually do anything.

169
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,470
Really?

170
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,435
Can't you tell by how badly I'm leaving?

171
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,644
I'm not letting you leave.

172
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,985
What about your air?

173
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,206
You're unbelievable.

174
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,710
I'm sorry. I'm not usually like this.

175
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:55,803
Hello?

176
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,928
I just walked out of there. it's over.

177
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:02,810
I see.

178
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,937
Since his father got sick,
the board took over,

179
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,110
and there's no point in talking to them.

180
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,482
He said we did good work.

181
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,609
Our clients need to hear this from us.

182
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,111
I know, Bert. Don't wait for me.

183
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,865
I'm standing by Lee's receptionist.

184
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,243
I didn't want to have to pay
for the long-distance call.

185
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,077
Very well, then.

186
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,772
Lane Pryce isn't coming back.
That's my guess.

187
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,224
I think they'd do that in a memo.

188
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,776
And I got five that says Cooper's retiring.

189
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,855
No champagne? I'd say he's got cancer.

190
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,192
-it's in bigger print now.
-Everyone,

191
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,611
if we could have your attention, please.

192
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,576
Bert.

193
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,878
"We have called this meeting
of our nearest and dearest

194
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,924
"to let you know of a change in the agency.

195
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,087
"After 30 years of consummate service,

196
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,548
"American Tobacco has reluctantly decided

197
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:24,013
"to consolidate their business
at Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn."

198
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,688
Damn it.

199
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,019
"So what does this mean to you?

200
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:36,362
"Now, Donald Draper,
partner, creative director."

201
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,829
Pete Campbell and Ken Cosgrove
will handle calls to clients.

202
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,250
Those are the only calls we want made
with this news.

203
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,957
Now, we've had a pretty good year.

204
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,169
We've gained more accounts
than We've lost, a lot more,

205
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,377
because our work
is thoughtful and effective.

206
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,462
Even Lucky Strike said so.

207
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,885
Which means that nothing should change.

208
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,966
Nothing will change.

209
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,018
We're gonna push ourselves
shoulder to shoulder,

210
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,437
and we're gonna overcome this
and succeed tenfold,

211
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,640
and it will be exhilarating.

212
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,151
Joe.

213
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,899
As Don said, "Nothing is going to change."

214
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,653
There's only a small modification in policy.

215
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,073
Anything out of the ordinary
must be approved by

216
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,955
myself, Joan Harris or Lane Pryce.

217
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,419
And that said,

218
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:34,170
inquiries as to paychecks and advances...

219
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,214
-What's going on?
-That's the head of accounting.

220
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,637
-What do you think is going on?
-Any questions?

221
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,596
Nothing?

222
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,431
Okay. If you want to talk to me individually,
I'll be in my office.

223
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,189
What happened?

224
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,111
We lost Lucky Strike.

225
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:57,943
Jesus.

226
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,109
But it sounds like
everything's under control.

227
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,660
I think I should go to a meeting.

228
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,076
Peggy, Freddy, Danny, Stan, in my office.

229
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,005
We're in some trouble here.

230
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,292
Creative needs to be on its toes.

231
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,253
Is it a "last hired, last fired" sort of thing?

232
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,510
You're in this room. That's all I can say.

233
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,637
Now, myself and the other partners

234
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,056
will be out there beating the bushes
for new business,

235
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,639
but creative's job
is to hold on to what we have.

236
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,643
That means clients' ideas
should seem better than they normally do.

237
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,025
For the next few weeks,
the only words you know are, "Yes, sir."

238
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,731
-Yes, sir.
-That means, Stan,

239
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,566
you babysit that Samsonite shoot every day.

240
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,528
And, Peggy, the Playtex presentation
is still set for tomorrow.

241
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,283
I'll bring in my notes.
I can prep you in 10 minutes.

242
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:50,041
No. You're still gonna do it.
It'll look desperate if I'm suddenly involved.

243
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,667
So, what about it then?

244
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,335
Be successful.

245
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,334
I'm not worried.

246
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,796
Okay. Let's skip the gossip out there.
Get to work.

247
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,842
Peggy.

248
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,181
You're not worried?

249
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,728
I don't know.
You seem to have everything in hand.

250
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,180
Should I be worried?

251
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,891
We don't even know
how bad this is gonna be

252
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,476
until Lane shows up.

253
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,863
Every time something good happens,
something bad happens.

254
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,110
I knew I'd pay for it.

255
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,943
You're not paying for anything.

256
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,278
But I'm counting on you.

257
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,328
Close that, will you?

258
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,347
Joan Harris.

259
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,599
Jeanie, I'm glad you're there.

260
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,473
I'm so sorry.

261
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,892
I feel so guilty.

262
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,982
It's not your fault.

263
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,656
I need to see you.
I need you to come down here.

264
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,822
I'm not flying to Raleigh.
When do you get back?

265
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,903
No, I'm here.

266
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,957
What are you talking about?
Mr. Cooper said he spoke with you.

267
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,952
He did, but I didn't go.

268
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,122
Damn it, Roger. Get on a plane.

269
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,841
You're very persuasive in person.

270
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:25,087
There's no point. It's been over for weeks.

271
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,843
Garner was supposed to give me a month,
and the bastard couldn't keep to it.

272
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,720
You knew about it?

273
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,597
I can't believe you.
We could've done something.

274
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,558
Don't yell at me.

275
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,481
You know what it's been like walking around
with this? I got a hole in my gut.

276
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,440
What am I supposed to do
with this information?

277
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,024
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,527
But I need you to know
why I need to see you.

279
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,490
You should've told me.
Why didn't you tell me?

280
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:54,453
I kept meaning to say something.
I thought I still had time. I don't know.

281
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,787
I should go. There's a lot of work to do.

282
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,040
Come after work. I'm at the Statler.

283
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,043
I had to stay away from Midtown.

284
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,253
I'll have to see.

285
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,772
I think my setup is good,

286
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,226
but Don always has these little examples
at the end

287
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,529
that explain to the client
how big the idea is.

288
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,989
And they're always kind of poetic.

289
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,488
So get Don to write it. We can't lose this.

290
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,911
Since when do we have doughnuts?

291
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,115
Condemned man always gets his choice
of a last meal.

292
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,414
You know what Pete Campbell
just said to me?

293
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,664
He said if anybody sends a resume
out of here, they're gonna get executed.

294
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,630
Fellas, we're on an account right now.

295
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,339
Playtex gloves protect a woman's hands,

296
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:53,221
so they're soft enough to touch
all the things a woman wants to touch.

297
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,351
All the things?

298
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,598
The exciting things she wants

299
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,275
to feel with her fingertips.

300
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,733
His lips,

301
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,565
the tuft of hair on his chest,

302
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,362
the small of his back.

303
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,870
-I can't imagine Don saying that.
-Excuse me,

304
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,160
I have a delivery for Peggy Olson.

305
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,579
What?

306
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,840
Are you Peggy Olson? It's COD.

307
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,548
Let me get my purse.

308
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,213
Go ahead without me.

309
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,433
I'm going to take care of this
and then practice.

310
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,637
Am I wrong or is she giving it off?

311
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,101
Well, it's the last days of Rome.

312
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,733
I was in an agency that went down.
The women get sex crazed.

313
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,022
The energy is very good.

314
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,904
They said they wanted
to revise the media plan,

315
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,825
but I think what they really wanted
was a budget

316
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,653
to see how much of their money
we haven't spent yet.

317
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,037
Who are we talking about?

318
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,330
Birds Eye.

319
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,158
Why are we worrying about
existing accounts?

320
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,084
If anything,
they're going to get more attention.

321
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,086
Because they're afraid we won't be here.

322
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,048
I have news from London.

323
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,878
Pete, wake up!

324
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,509
Lane thinks our billings are probably
around $22 million without Lucky,

325
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,055
but he has to look at everything in person.

326
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:16,886
When's he coming?

327
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,263
As soon as he can.

328
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,600
David Montgomery's memorial
is tomorrow afternoon.

329
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,139
In case we need cheering up?

330
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,733
The man was
senior vice-president of accounts

331
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,106
at the number four agency.

332
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,273
There's gonna be a lot of
vulnerable clients in attendance.

333
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,614
I think Roger knew him.

334
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,739
Sorry to interrupt.
It's AI Weaver from Glo-Coat.

335
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,033
-What does he want?
-I don't know.

336
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,864
Do you want me on the call?

337
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,450
Didn't you talk to him this morning?

338
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,289
No.

339
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,436
AI, how are you?

340
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,354
Hello, Don- I'm glad I could reach you.

341
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,935
I just wanted to let you know

342
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,484
we appreciate everything
you've done for us,

343
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,563
but we've decided to take the account
in a different direction.

344
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,897
-All right. AI...
-I want you to know

345
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,027
it wasn't an easy decision.

346
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,450
-Now can I talk?
-Sure.

347
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,277
I don't think you understand
what's happened here.

348
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,158
And I'm not talking
about losing Lucky Strike.

349
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,705
Lucky Strike didn't enter into it.

350
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,249
Really?

351
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,541
So that has nothing to do with this?

352
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,961
Don, it's a simple coincidence
that it happened now.

353
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,755
Okay, you're right. It is bad timing.

354
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,673
How can you blame us for
wanting to move on?

355
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,468
Because that commercial,
that little cowboy kid,

356
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,637
was the first successful strategy
you've been near

357
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,931
since you sponsored
Fibber McGee and Molly.

358
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,758
-We won the CLIO!
-You won the CLIO.

359
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,185
With work we did for you!
With your direction!

360
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,356
Believe me, we know how it looks,
but it's just business, plain and simple.

361
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,526
I'm coming out there.
We're gonna talk about this in person.

362
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,445
I'm sorry, Don. The decision's been made.

363
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,527
I just thought you should hear it from me.

364
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,859
You know we're gonna want
another shot at this soon.

365
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,489
As long as you're around.

366
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,991
We'll be here. Don't worry.

367
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,163
Good luck, Don.

368
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,287
I hope we can work together
again sometime.

369
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:06,413
Okay.

370
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,460
-Goodbye.
-Good bye.

371
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,843
What was that?

372
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,966
Nothing.

373
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,344
Do you want ice?

374
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,226
No, but I need a favor.
Make sure I don't overdo it.

375
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,310
Okay. How do I... It's hard to tell with you.

376
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,863
Stop me at three. This is one.

377
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,866
The doctor says
they never let the labor go past two sunsets.

378
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,414
What exactly is the problem?

379
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,289
Apparently Trudy's pelvis is too small
and the baby's shoulders can't get through.

380
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,744
They should cut it out.

381
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,879
They don't like to start there.

382
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,291
Go to the hospital.
There's nothing to do here.

383
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,671
It's obviously what matters to you.

384
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,085
What?

385
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,764
I don't know what the hell
you said to them this morning.

386
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,397
So, Joan, that puts us at what,
$20 million and change?

387
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,232
Are you doubting my efforts?

388
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:13,434
All you had to do was
tell them everything was fine.

389
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,103
You think that call's easy to make?

390
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,528
I think you're distracted.

391
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,698
And because of that,
I think you scared the shit out of them.

392
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,322
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

393
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,558
Don't blow a gasket.

394
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,102
He called looking for me
and my secretary told him where I was.

395
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,471
Incredible.

396
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,440
That was something else.

397
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,185
There he is. The man of the hour.

398
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,863
Ted. How considerate of you to stop by.

399
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,863
I wish the baby was here already,
but I'm sure everyone feels that way.

400
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,944
Good news is always worth waiting for.

401
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,996
Well, Jeannie, remember,
don't let your vanity get the best of you.

402
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:11,326
There is nothing wrong
with being called "grandma"

403
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:19,876
It's a rattle. You can get it engraved.
Ogilvy sent me one when my son was born.

404
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,838
Thank you. What do you want, Ted?

405
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,761
No, this is about what you want.

406
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,969
I mean, hell, you're about to have everything
the minute that baby comes.

407
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,850
You know your father-in-law
never stops talking about you?

408
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,352
And he doesn't know the half of it.

409
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,729
You've brought in a little business
since you went out on your own.

410
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,734
Glo-Coat, Life Cereal, Sugarberry Hams,
Vick Chemical, obviously,

411
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,316
Mountain Dew, Fillmore Auto,
Birds Eye, Ponds.

412
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,697
I didn't do all that by myself.

413
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,829
Pete, as far as I'm concerned,
you're what's missing from CGC.

414
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,408
Jim Cutler's due to retire.

415
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,710
Campbell, Gleason & Chaough?

416
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,749
Has a nice ring to it.

417
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,040
Wouldn't you want your name first?

418
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,083
I'm open to it
if we're having that discussion.

419
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,174
You'll have a full voting third.

420
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,974
I'm not Don. it's not the Wild West.

421
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,722
We just got Alfa Romeo,
little italian sports car.

422
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:11,802
I don't know if you've heard of it,

423
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,558
but I think you'll really enjoy driving one.

424
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,148
-I don't drive.
-I'll teach you.

425
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,735
Tom, Jeannie, remember,
my offer still stands.

426
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,280
If you want a hotel room,
I can get you one across the street.

427
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,499
Roger. I let you come over
because you said you needed to talk.

428
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,879
We can talk.

429
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,959
Jeanie, I need you.

430
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,717
Stop it, or we can talk on the phone.

431
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,095
Is that what you sleep in now?

432
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,056
What do you want? I'm exhausted!

433
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,813
I waited for you at the hotel.
Why didn't you come? Are you mad at me?

434
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,486
No! But, Roger,

435
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,154
I can't do this anymore.

436
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,856
You always say that.

437
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,862
Then you come back to me
because we belong together.

438
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,033
Don't do that.

439
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,075
I need you right now.

440
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,289
Because I'm a port in a storm?

441
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,793
No. Because I feel like shit,
and you care about me.

442
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,788
I'm not a solution to your problems.

443
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,623
I'm another problem.

444
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,837
Are you serious?

445
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,002
I can't do this anymore.

446
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,681
You'll change your mind. You'll see.

447
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,099
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,140
I just can't do this anymore.

449
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,682
So what are you trying to say?

450
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,267
Roger...

451
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,195
So that night we got mugged,
that was the last time?

452
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,697
Wish I'd known that.

453
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,556
God, I'd think this place
would be packed still.

454
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,519
It's 8:00. There's only so much
we can pretend like we're doing.

455
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,067
-Are you okay?
-You want something?

456
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,742
I'd rather eat, but that's me.

457
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,361
I'm one over for the day.

458
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,910
See that?

459
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,412
I kissed you and it got quiet.

460
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,170
How'd it go?

461
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,544
It was

462
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,426
miserable.

463
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,224
Clients are running scared.

464
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,269
I'm used to having my ideas rejected,
not me.

465
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,767
How do you do it?

466
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:46,688
My job is to present facts.

467
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,737
If they're unhappy with the agency,
it's not my problem.

468
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,779
Who's unhappy?

469
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,495
Come on. Clients are always unhappy.

470
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,571
Yeah?

471
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,286
Like who?

472
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,044
-Are you kidding?
-No.

473
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,168
Why? I'm drowning here.

474
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,465
You know I can't do that.

475
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,087
If a client is unhappy, they're unhappy.

476
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,761
There's nothing against telling them
to have dinner with me.

477
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:15,837
Or, if you don't want to,

478
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,468
tell me who they are.
I'll call them out of the blue.

479
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,390
I can't do that.

480
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,806
Sure you can. Who'll know?

481
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,347
The standard of ethics in this business
is low enough.

482
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,398
And God knows I've done some things
I'm not proud of,

483
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,442
but those other agencies pay me.

484
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,107
What about protecting the clients?

485
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,193
So I'm gonna kill my business
to save yours?

486
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:37,826
It's not your business. It's Atherton's.
This is different. This is everything to me.

487
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:42,081
I don't believe this.
You want a shoulder to cry on, fine.

488
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,829
You want to throw me to the wolves
so you can save your neck, forget it.

489
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,787
-I would do it for you.
-I would never ask.

490
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,042
I would never use you like that.

491
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,843
Because I know the difference between
what we have and this stupid office.

492
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,525
Mr. Cosgrove says Playtex just left the hotel.

493
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,022
Thank you!

494
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,563
God, I'm so nervous.

495
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,027
You need to relax.

496
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,110
I can't do this drunk.

497
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:25,207
I know a technique
that can really take the nerves away.

498
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,535
I learned it from a yogi.

499
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,917
Show me.

500
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,050
Close your eyes. Now, take a deep breath.

501
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,092
Fill your lungs until you can't anymore.

502
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,140
Stick out your stomach.

503
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,727
Now release it in a cool stream
right in my face.

504
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,314
Hey! What are you doing?

505
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,688
You said you wanted to relax. Let's relax.

506
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:57,819
Stan, no.

507
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,197
Come on. You're so horny
I can smell it on your breath.

508
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,703
Stan, knock it off.

509
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,873
Hey, I saw you with
the delivery boy yesterday.

510
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,704
What? He's my boyfriend.

511
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,878
Come on, baby. It's the end of the world.

512
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,584
Why do you keep making me reject you?

513
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,671
I was trying to do you a favor.

514
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,929
Well, thank you. I'm not anxious anymore.

515
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,697
Should I get the door?

516
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,321
No. It didn't get any worse.

517
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,117
What exactly did he say?

518
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,701
He said they were terrified about
the British banning cigarette ads from TV,

519
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,956
and they need to cut costs.

520
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,585
Maybe it's a good time to
get out of this business.

521
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,883
That's crap. Sales were up 10%.

522
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,469
You do what you can do.

523
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,306
David Montgomery's memorial
is in 40 minutes at the River Club.

524
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,551
David Montgomery died?

525
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,555
Well, there's your silver lining.
Who the hell wants to go to that?

526
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,265
We're trying to get new accounts.

527
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,395
Remember how to do that?

528
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,443
You wanna dogpile on me?
Saving that account was impossible.

529
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,069
Because you ignored it!
One damn account, and you ignored it.

530
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:23,321
You don't know what you're talking about.
Pete, explain it to him.

531
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,703
You squeezed me off of it, Roger.
You wanted it all to yourself.

532
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,621
He would have never let this happen!

533
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,498
But you do what you can do,
which is nothing!

534
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,206
Hey, you're the one who dragged me
into your amateur hour.

535
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,708
I was perfectly happy where I was.

536
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,210
And why did I do it? Out of friendship.

537
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,133
But now that the account's gone,
I guess that went with it.

538
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,132
Get out of here, all of you.
Go chase a hearse.

539
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,005
Sorry to interrupt.

540
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,803
Mr. Campbell, your father-in-law called.

541
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,931
Your wife and your daughter
are resting comfortably.

542
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,179
Just now?

543
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,765
Yes, it happened. You've got a baby girl.

544
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,437
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

545
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,768
Good job.

546
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,312
Thank you, Megan.

547
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,566
Okay, we should get going.

548
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,489
Let me get my coat.

549
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,993
Where does Draper get off?

550
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:21,546
Lee Garner, Jr. never took you seriously
because you never took yourself seriously.

551
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,894
Are you ready?

552
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:36,644
No hard feelings?

553
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,151
None at all.

554
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,650
Everything good?

555
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,649
Absolutely.

556
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,990
And so, I think about that night,

557
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,665
staring out the window
of that Detroit hotel room,

558
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,619
knowing we were going home with Buick,

559
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,496
and saying to David,

560
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,753
"Is this the best thing
we're ever going to do?"

561
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,928
Lynn, it was your fifth birthday.

562
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,219
And the next day,
when we were in the airport,

563
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,643
he showed me this pendant
he'd bought the day before downtown.

564
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,022
And as he closed the box, he said,

565
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,192
"Crosby, that's the best thing I'll ever do."

566
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,066
I know it's hard,

567
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:26,364
but Dave loved you
more than anything, sweetheart.

568
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,449
That's Stu Carlsbad from Ralston Purina.

569
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,155
He's always ripe.

570
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,581
We have dog food experience.

571
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,204
I got him.

572
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,831
I don't know how prepared I am,

573
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,130
but Dave was always a fan of winging it.

574
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,423
Beth, his beautiful wife,

575
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,927
you were there before he made partner,
and then you gave him to us.

576
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,634
But you know you and Lynnie

577
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,685
were always on his mind.

578
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,188
True story.

579
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:03,815
We'd been in London for three months
trying to nail down British Petroleum.

580
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,399
Never happened.

581
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:11,110
But once a week,
he would drag me to Portobello Road

582
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,911
looking for thimbles
for your collection, Lynn.

583
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,497
Silver thimbles.

584
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,414
And he was an expert.

585
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:26,125
It's because Playtex is strong enough
to protect a woman's hands.

586
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,299
Through her fingertips,
she can dry the tears of a child

587
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:34,467
or feel the warmth of her husband's skin.

588
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,598
Playtex protects a woman's touch.

589
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,890
It's very romantic.

590
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,771
I have to admit, when you first brought it up,

591
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,524
I didn't think that was possible
for latex gloves.

592
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,196
These images are about the moments
after the housework is over.

593
00:35:55,445 --> 00:36:00,702
They're about the meaningful life
a woman leads when work is done.

594
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,168
Well, I feel pretty good about this.
Peggy, our pleasure.

595
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,883
We're thrilled to get this in the first try.

596
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:13,384
Now, I'm gonna let you get back to the hotel,
and then steaks and a show.

597
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,561
That went well.

598
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,522
You have lipstick all over your teeth.

599
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,390
What?

600
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,956
Why are you still here?

601
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:47,248
I didn't know if I should leave or not.
How was the funeral?

602
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,090
We'll see.

603
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,464
Get me the campaign briefs
on Ken's accounts,

604
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,045
and then you can go.

605
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,801
And send Peggy in.

606
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,860
Miss Olson's gone for the night,
but if you need help...

607
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,156
Did you do that?

608
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,778
I thought, in the end,
you wouldn't want to throw it away.

609
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,123
You're wrong.

610
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:26,537
That commercial was great,
and nothing they do can change that.

611
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,081
I'll take those.

612
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,262
Thank you. You can go.

613
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,471
You sure you don't want some help?

614
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,015
This is a little complicated.

615
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,435
That's okay.
I'd really like to learn what goes on here.

616
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,103
Really?

617
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,485
Well, first of all, I think it would help me

618
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,564
from making mistakes with your work
the way I have.

619
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:58,489
And, secondly, I think I'd like, eventually,
to do what you do,

620
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,366
or what Miss Olson does.

621
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,163
I didn't know that.

622
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,125
Unless you'd rather be alone.
I don't want to be in the way.

623
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,912
No. I don't mind.

624
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:25,729
This is a strategy statement
signed by Fillmore Auto Parts.

625
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,687
Copywriters stray from these midstream

626
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:34,021
sometimes if they have a better idea,
but we can't take that chance now.

627
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,319
Wouldn't clients want a better idea?

628
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,575
What'd you like about the commercial?

629
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,374
You're putting me on the spot.

630
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,959
I know it's a floor wax,

631
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:52,960
but I really remember that feeling
of being a little kid

632
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,511
and feeling like I was being punished
when my mother cleaned the house.

633
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,721
-Where are you from?
-Montreal.

634
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,640
We didn't have Glo-Coat.

635
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,887
Why'd you move here?

636
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,267
Well, first of all, it's New York.
For an artist, it's Mecca.

637
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,598
You're an artist?

638
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:14,733
I wouldn't say I'm an artist.
I'm an artistic person. I majored in literature,

639
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,941
and I've dabbled in writing and painting
and a little bit of acting.

640
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,454
What are you laughing about?

641
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,375
Because I just realized
I Know everything about you.

642
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,328
I mean, you're in my head all day,
even when I go home,

643
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:34,210
and you don't know anything about me.

644
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:37,042
Well, you haven't been here that long.

645
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,925
And you don't know how long I will be,
so why get to know me?

646
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,930
I can see that's what everybody must think.

647
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,266
You judge people on their work.

648
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,972
I'm the same way.

649
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,776
Everything else is sentimental.

650
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,362
You want one?

651
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,565
How many is that?

652
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,328
Four.

653
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,206
I know you're angry,

654
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,960
but I hope you're not afraid,
because you will get through this.

655
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,793
You don't know that.

656
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,847
Why do you care what I think?

657
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,353
Megan, I don't think this is a good idea.

658
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,777
This has nothing to do with work.

659
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,659
I can't make any mistakes right now.

660
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,082
Let's be clear.

661
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm not gonna
run out of here crying tomorrow.

662
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,423
I just want you right now.

663
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:25,696
Hey.

664
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,990
Where are you going?

665
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,863
I'm exhausted.

666
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,077
How was your day?

667
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,207
Fine.

668
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,331
I know how to make it better.

669
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,966
I'm really tired.

670
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,293
Sit down.

671
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,227
What'd you buy?

672
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,184
Look.

673
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,527
Look at it.

674
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,627
Sign it.

675
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,894
"To my loving wife."

676
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:56,579
I'm so proud of you.

677
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,809
You should go first.
Actually, I should go first.

678
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,983
Do you want to grab a bite?

679
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,325
I want you to go home
and I want you to sleep.

680
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,203
And I don't want you
drinking any more tonight.

681
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,680
Wait. Did you want to go first?

682
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,388
Good night, Mr. Draper.

683
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,859
Didn't expect to see you here.

684
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:18,035
I was going to call,
but I didn't want to do this over the phone.

685
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,541
So you were gonna write it on an envelope.

686
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,874
Can I come inside?

687
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,278
I got you a meeting with Heinz.

688
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,900
It's vinegar, sauces and beans.

689
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,366
They're at Ketchum, MacLeod,
and they're restless.

690
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,414
Faye...

691
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:04,419
I thought about what you said,
and I thought about you.

692
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:09,549
And I thought about,
"Whatever. You are my life right now."

693
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:15,096
You didn't have to do this.

694
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,092
I wanted to.

695
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,156
Thank you.

696
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,655
You're welcome.

697
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,119
Do you wanna stay?

698
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,127
I'll probably fall asleep on you.

699
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,969
Just sit with me.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
