1
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,049
-I'm worried that's gonna hit the ceiling.
-We always get a tall one.

2
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:50,099
Not taller than the living room.

3
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,270
Let's go back to the other one
and stand next to it.

4
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,766
Hey, Sally.

5
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,893
Sally.

6
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,437
Hello.

7
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,781
It's Glen.

8
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,283
I know that.

9
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,952
Well, you all just walked right by me
when you came in.

10
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,453
Sorry.

11
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,290
What are you doing back here?

12
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,793
My mom got married
and now I'm supposed to live with him.

13
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,917
I saw your new dad.
My mom said that would happen.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,213
After they're married a while,
they'll have a baby.

15
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,966
You should probably
ask for something big now.

16
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:30,262
Hi. Are you getting a tree?

17
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,259
No, I'm working.

18
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,053
What do you do?

19
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,479
I bring twine over.

20
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,681
I get to cut it.

21
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,725
Wow.

22
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,485
Yeah, I made it.

23
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,528
Those are good colors.

24
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,444
We're leaving as soon as I find you.

25
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,734
Bye, Glen.

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,493
Maybe I'll call you.

27
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,665
-Good time, bad time?
-Yes.

28
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,468
You've got a résumé
from the girl you met at the Ziegfeld Theater.

29
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:10,805
File it.

30
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,385
AI Weaver at Johnson Wax
requested another print of Glo-Coat.

31
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,351
And you got this very important
piece of mail.

32
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,854
Open it.

33
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,535
"Dear Daddy, Bobby thinks
this is going to the North Pole,

34
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,365
"but we should keep up the roos."
R-double-O-S.

35
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,449
Too much television.

36
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:41,162
"Bobby says that he knows
he doesn't deserve a Heathkit radio

37
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,669
"because of what happened with leaving
the freezer open in the garage,

38
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:49,178
"but maybe Santa could choose
from a bicycle, a better pellet gun,

39
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:53,257
"a clock radio, a transistor radio,
a drum set and a bicycle."

40
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,471
I left that freezer open.

41
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,105
"Baby Gene wants a fireman.
I don't know what that means."

42
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,147
it's adorable.
"And I would like the gold necklace

43
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,321
"that you can put your initials on
that we saw at Macy's.

44
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:12,152
"And most of all, I'd like you to be here
on Christmas morning to give it to me,

45
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,328
"but I know you can't be."

46
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:20,409
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:29,719
So, a drum set, a fire truck,
the necklace is $30

48
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,421
and it's SBD, Sally Beth Draper.

49
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:43,266
And, get her some Beatles 45s
and him a transistor radio, too.

50
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,687
The girls went to Joan
and I don't want to undermine her,

51
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,365
but are we allowed to bring a friend
to the Christmas party?

52
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:57,454
Lane scaled it back to a glass of gin
and a box of Velveeta.

53
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,622
We're tightening our belts.

54
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,503
But you will be getting a bonus,
even if I have to see to it myself.

55
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,459
Well, thank you.

56
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,050
I didn't want to have to write a letter
to Santa.

57
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,760
-Do you want this?
-Sure.

58
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,301
Send him in.

59
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,769
Ready Freddy.

60
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,692
-it's been too long.
-No, just long enough.

61
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,896
You look good. Have a seat.

62
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,440
Jeez. It looks like an Italian hospital in here.

63
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,322
I know, I know. Jane got a decorator.

64
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,120
I feel like with my hair,
you can't even see me in here.

65
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,745
-Something brown?
-Maybe later,

66
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,621
What time is it? Look at that.

67
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,914
So, I thought it'd be best
if I broached this opportunity in person.

68
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,425
Well, don't be fooled by the setup here.
It's Potemkinville.

69
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,093
Well, maybe I can help.

70
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,596
I walked out of JWT
with a present under my arm.

71
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,556
Pond's Cold Cream. It's $2 million,
but they'll never even notice it's gone.

72
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,849
How the hell did you do that?

73
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,850
Suffice it to say
the client and I are in a fraternity together.

74
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,526
I can't handle the account myself,
but I'm clean and sober now.

75
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,407
Sixteen months without a drop.

76
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,613
So when you said, "Maybe later"...“'___

77
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,486
What am I gonna say?

78
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,368
Look, if it doesn't work out,
you can keep the account.

79
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,164
What am I gonna say? Yes.

80
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,421
There is one little caveat.

81
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,713
Name it.

82
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,550
I feel like I'm getting sucked into that thing.

83
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:40,182
I don't want Pete Campbell near this.
I was surprised you took him along.

84
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,728
No comment.

85
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,724
Sugarberry has been selling hams
for 30 years at a fairly steady rate

86
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,151
while doing everything they could
to create sales,

87
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,149
and then we do this in a month.

88
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,821
We have to give them time to reconcile that.

89
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,315
Freddy!

90
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:58,567
Ballerina.

91
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,496
I feel like the Tin Man.

92
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,290
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

93
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,079
How are you, Freddy?

94
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,378
Couldn't be better.
I was just talking about you.

95
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,258
Freddy here just ran in from the yard
with a $2-million account in his mouth.

96
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,334
Pond's Cold Cream.

97
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,178
Well, that explains why you look so good.

98
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,183
A little early for that, isn't it, Don?

99
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,176
Very funny.

100
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,521
The pedigree of this account
is that it was boosted

101
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:31,692
and I'll need to maintain
my personal contact to it creatively,

102
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,439
if that's all right with you, Don.

103
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,437
If you don't mind working
with this old thing over here.

104
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,612
I was counting on it.

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,481
None for me.

106
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,158
When can you bring them in?

107
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,665
I'll be handling this one, Pete.

108
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:53,881
Well, Freddy, I hate to bring this up,
but I do believe it's on everyone's mind.

109
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,004
We all want to know if you can be Santa
at the Christmas party.

110
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,298
It's the role I was born to play.

111
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:08,561
Francis residence.

112
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,689
Can Sally come to the phone?

113
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,607
Who may I say is calling?

114
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,527
Stanley. I have a question about homework.

115
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,944
Sally, there's a young man
on the phone, Stanley.

116
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,860
Hello?

117
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,278
It's Glen.

118
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:26,829
Hi.

119
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,700
Don't you wanna know
why I said my name is Stanley?

120
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,743
I guess.

121
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,288
Because this is private.

122
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,834
Where are you?

123
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,964
Where do you think?
I'm down the street at my mom's.

124
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,802
How come you didn't move?

125
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,979
I don't know.

126
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,767
But I hate it here. I really, really do.

127
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,358
Why?

128
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,565
I won't tell anybody.

129
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:04,652
Every time I go around a corner,
I keep thinking I'll see my dad.

130
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,080
Sorry. They're not gonna
get back together, you know.

131
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,452
Glen?

132
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,785
Especially now that she's doing it
with somebody else.

133
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,244
Doing what?

134
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,370
Glen!

135
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,337
Well, don't worry. One day,
they'll wake up and they'll want to move.

136
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,384
You'll see. I gotta go. Bye.

137
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,420
Goodbye.

138
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,841
Who's Stanley?

139
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,431
A boy.

140
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,723
We will soon be charging clients
for this service

141
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,025
and Dr. Atherton will in turn be charging us.

142
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,693
Significantly less.

143
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,154
Bert and I have been meaning
to work together for years.

144
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,028
Out in the open at least.

145
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,984
Very good, then. Shall we dim the lights?

146
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:50,072
No, beginning the presentation
with the film is a mistake.

147
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,079
Audiences will listen to anything
in anticipation.

148
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,660
See what I was talking about?

149
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,713
Simply said, we believe
that at the motivational research group,

150
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,210
we have brought the science
of consumer evaluation

151
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,635
to a point of precision
like that of a surgeon's scalpel.

152
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,175
No doubt, with the help of minds
like Dr. Faye Miller,

153
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,508
with whose work you are already
unknowingly familiar.

154
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,431
Faye helped develop the indelible image

155
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,559
that has become the standard
of feminine hygiene advertising,

156
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,976
the carefree gal in white pants.

157
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,031
It's right up there with the polio vaccine.

158
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:32,073
Beyond demographic information,
salary, age, marital situation,

159
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,625
we've tried to find a way to select prospects
who can really provide insight.

160
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,786
This test is our beginning.

161
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,999
Take a minute, fill it out
and please, take a cookie.

162
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,296
What's it mean if we don't?

163
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,632
That you're a psychopath.

164
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,932
The point of this exercise
is to familiarize you with our methods.

165
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,641
The point of the cookies is that
everyone should be rewarded for their time.

166
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,608
These questions have been designed
to get at what subjects really want

167
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,734
instead of what they say they do.

168
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:09,034
What are the real feelings
that exist below the surface?

169
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,371
For example,
"How would you describe your father?"

170
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,622
No matter what the answer, it creates
a level of intimacy for the next question,

171
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,495
"Who makes decisions in your household?"

172
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,040
There's some pencils if you need them.

173
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,764
I apologize. I have an appointment.

174
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,117
That is yours to keep.

175
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,737
Is that work?

176
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,624
No, it's me. It's kind of silly.

177
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,747
Tell me when they pull the curtains
so I can get out of here.

178
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,703
-Do you want ice?
-Yes.

179
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,090
What are you doing?

180
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,679
Saint Vincent's junior staff Christmas party.

181
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,933
At 8:00 in the morning?

182
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,981
Well, the shift just ended
and we have to do it soon

183
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,731
because Christmas and New Year's,
we're overrun with suicides.

184
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,396
Well...

185
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,733
Phoebe. And you're Don. I know.

186
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,610
I hope we haven't met.

187
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,197
Well, I'm right across the hall.
We wave to each other.

188
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,371
You met my friend Sarah.
She fell on the stairs.

189
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,918
Maybe you weren't in uniform.

190
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,922
Don't pretend that you've never noticed me.

191
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,669
You always grunt when
you put your Keys in the door.

192
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,427
It's not good, which is why
I am inviting you to my party.

193
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:59,390
I really appreciate the invitation, Phoebe,
but I'm late for work.

194
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,105
So you should thank me for waking you.

195
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,029
Tallulah Bankhead, she's glamorous.

196
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,152
She seems more uncompromising
than a movie star,

197
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,654
you know, because she's on Broadway.

198
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,244
She never got off Broadway
because she's not beautiful enough.

199
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,822
Shame on you. Come on.

200
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,078
A little backstage at the makeup mirror
with Pond's,

201
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,253
a big bouquet of roses, opening night.
"The choice of professionals."

202
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,625
It's good, right?

203
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,628
All of their research says
that they're trying to get young women.

204
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,879
Well, young women look up to older women.

205
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,799
For beauty tips? Are you joking?

206
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,394
I know the client. This thing is rigged.
That's what he wants.

207
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,267
It's not just about the client.

208
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,895
People are looking at everything we do here.

209
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,602
Have you seen our work?
It's very different than this.

210
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,062
Frederick van Rumsen!

211
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,145
Von.

212
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,867
Boy, oh, boy, were you missed at lunch.
Cal Rutledge from Pond's. What a cut-up.

213
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,324
-What do you mean?
-I mean I gotta go lay down.

214
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,876
I can't believe that's his job.

215
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,171
Hello. Could you tell him
Mr. Rumsen's on the phone?

216
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,140
-Interrupt him.
-What's wrong?

217
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,557
Calvin, do you have anything to tell me?

218
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,855
Did you just have lunch
with Roger Sterling?

219
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,695
So you have nothing to say?

220
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,442
Hey, hey, don't do that. it's okay.

221
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,328
Pull yourself together.

222
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,162
First Baptist Church, 79th and Broadway.

223
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,128
I gotta go.

224
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,830
Is everything okay?

225
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,041
What, you can't put two and two together?

226
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:58,092
Listen, cutie, wrap your head around
finding the right famous face

227
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,469
or my other thing about the T-zone.

228
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:04,303
I want 10 tags apiece, then I narrow it down
and then we go to Don.

229
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,353
Are you serious?

230
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:11,727
I'll do them, too. Don't worry, I'm sure
yours will be better because you're girlier.

231
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,357
Lee Garner Jr

232
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,445
Put him through.

233
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,077
Caroline, did he say what it was about?

234
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,291
Well, hello, Lee. How's Palm Beach?

235
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,127
Beautiful. Heading back there
in a couple of days.

236
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,591
Back? Where the hell are you?

237
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,295
In town doing a little Christmas shopping.

238
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,718
Yeah, I'd love to see you
now that I Know you're in town.

239
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,798
Caroline!

240
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,186
-How about dinner tomorrow?
-Christmas party.

241
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,104
How about lunch?
We're having a Christmas party.

242
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,645
Why am I getting my invitation so late?

243
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,897
Because I thought you were out of town.

244
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,985
Madison Avenue office Christmas party?
I've seen the movies. You find me.

245
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,276
-Okay. 3200?
-No. 4:00.

246
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,453
5:00. Shit. Go, get Lane.

247
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,581
I'm looking forward to it.

248
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,829
You won't be disappointed.

249
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,336
I just got off the phone with Lee Garner Jr.
He's going to stop by.

250
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,922
We're gonna have to have
a Christmas party, a real one.

251
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,881
-How did that happen?
-It happened.

252
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,969
In fact, he was offended
that we hadn't invited him already.

253
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:31,356
Uninvite him. Take him to the Four Seasons.
He can have three entrees.

254
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,479
This man doesn't care about food.

255
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,272
I know that you've lived your life
from a bottomless pocket,

256
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,155
but there's a very real system of money
coming in versus money going out.

257
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:49,662
Overtime, supplies being used carelessly,
leaving the lights on, parties, it adds up.

258
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,744
Listen, Olivier, aren't you
the one who's always talking about how

259
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,171
Lucky Strike is 99%
of our business or something?

260
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,049
69% if we land Pond's Cold Cream.

261
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,719
We have Pond's and I hate the way you say
"percent," you know that?

262
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,341
What about our other clients?

263
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,264
We have no other clients.

264
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:11,059
If Lee Garner Jr. wants three wise men
flown in from Jerusalem, he gets it.

265
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,731
Caroline! Get Jeanie in here.

266
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,943
You want something?
I brought it from home.

267
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,401
Yes?

268
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,076
There's been a small adjustment
to the scale of our Christmas party.

269
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,243
Lower or higher?

270
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,868
Lee Garner Jr. will be joining us.

271
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,040
I trust you'll make
the appropriate improvements.

272
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,830
Well, I don't. We need to change its rating
from convalescent home to Roman orgy.

273
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,000
Maalox.

274
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:47,466
I want a bartender and a tree. Screw him.
I love Christmas.

275
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,674
You love Christmas parties.

276
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,145
We're going to need more employees,
so I'm going to allow everyone escorts,

277
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,268
even the girls.

278
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,519
New York food, deli and Chinese,
and some kind of gift for Mr. Garner.

279
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,065
You're off-limits.

280
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,609
I don't think he's the one
who needs to be reminded.

281
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,652
Come on. He was all over you
the time you wore that red dress,

282
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,487
the one with the bow in the back
that makes you look like a present.

283
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,822
You have an incredible memory.

284
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,954
Yeah, I think about it a lot.
That dress, I mean.

285
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,503
-Could you wear it?
-Stop it.

286
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,580
I didn't mean it that way.

287
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:24,002
All I was saying was this is the office
and that's life.

288
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,884
And this is good and that's life.

289
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,731
What a nice surprise.

290
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,022
Sheila at the Station baked Them.

291
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,275
Sheila. Who's Sheila?

292
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,613
She's 60 years old.
You see how shaky the icing is?

293
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,621
Hey, knock it off.

294
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,705
-Why? ls Rasputin home?
-She'll hear you.

295
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,586
I want to lie down. I'm tired.

296
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,094
-My bed is covered with work.
-That's kind of symbolic.

297
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:12,218
How is my face?
Fresh, dewy, well cared for?

298
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,893
Let me get a better look.

299
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,475
You taste like soap.

300
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,477
I'm in the middle of a seven-day beauty plan.

301
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,815
Can't we just get undressed
and lie together again?

302
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,032
That was a bad idea.

303
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,240
How long is this gonna go on?

304
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,492
I'm sorry you feel you've put in the time.

305
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,417
-We're not doing anything.
-We're doing some things.

306
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,920
We're not doing anything I can't do myself.

307
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,875
Mark, I told you I want you.

308
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,845
In fact, I want you so much, I wanna wait.

309
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,058
And I told you
there's nothing to be afraid of.

310
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,852
I want to be your first.

311
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,769
You're so old-fashioned.

312
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,229
No, I'm not.

313
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,867
In Sweden, they make love
the minute they feel attracted.

314
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:16,698
And it's healthier, because you can find,
you know, the perfect person.

315
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,706
Because making love is
a very important part of a life with someone.

316
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:24,005
The most important in Sweden, anyway.

317
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,711
Where did you hear that?

318
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,964
I read this article,
"The Swedish Way of Love."

319
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,420
It's very enlightened.

320
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,599
You're never going to get me
to do anything Swedish people do.

321
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,099
All you have to do
is take a couple of steps that way.

322
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,600
I brought you cookies.

323
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,978
I think you should go home.

324
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,912
And I want you to think about that.

325
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,218
Sorry. Everybody leaves
the moment you have to clean up.

326
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,730
I might have a vacuum.

327
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,900
-Where the hell are you coming from?
-Work.

328
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,702
Where do you work?
The White Horse tavern?

329
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,790
Did you have a party or something?

330
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:46,292
-I hate parties.
-And you hate Christmas. I got it.

331
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,963
I don't hate Christmas.

332
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,753
I hate this Christmas.

333
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,933
Of course you have heat.

334
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,397
Can I get you something?

335
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,144
Come on. You're going to bed.

336
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,282
Look where we are.

337
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,367
-You're good with that.
-My father was a drunk.

338
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:26,082
If you don't behave yourself,
I'm not gonna take your shoes off

339
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,004
and you're gonna wake up
with sores on your heels.

340
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,253
How can you stand
going to a hospital every day?

341
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,963
I love working at the hospital.

342
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,642
People coming into the world,
people leaving it.

343
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,719
Everything happens there.

344
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,858
Good night, Don.

345
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,354
Good night!

346
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,453
Against the wall, please.

347
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,781
Megan.

348
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,248
The bar looks good.

349
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,955
I need you to get the chafing dishes
and the Sternos.

350
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,712
Then call Peking House
and move the delivery from 4:00 to 3:30.

351
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,543
-They're always late.
-Yes, Joan.

352
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,847
That one.

353
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:24,344
On the shortlist I've got Tallulah,
Jessica Tandy, Barbara Stanwyck

354
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,724
and Doris Day, different types.

355
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:31,768
I don't even understand your list.
What's wrong with Elizabeth Taylor?

356
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,771
Isn't it about making old ladies look good?

357
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:36,735
Nothing makes old ladies look good.

358
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,366
But Pond's does. That's the point.

359
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,569
If young girls started using it,

360
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,872
maybe they'd End a husband
and they wouldn't be so angry.

361
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,460
All I was trying to say
is that I've used the stuff

362
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:53,256
and I think there's something
about the experience of putting it on

363
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,707
and looking in the mirror.

364
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,760
If we were to go another way,
that's not a bad idea.

365
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,053
Indulging yourself, right?

366
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,598
No, if you use Pond's, you'll get married.

367
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,300
That's not what I was saying.

368
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,681
Or we could go the other way.

369
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,479
If you don't use it,
then you'll never get married.

370
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,437
Which is better?

371
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,984
You know what? Just write them down.

372
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,062
No, I'm not writing that down.

373
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,899
I'm sorry if I hit a nerve there, precious.

374
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,828
You know, Freddy, I have brought
your name up 100 times in the last year

375
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:29,080
to come in and freelance, for me,
but everybody is right about you.

376
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:33,208
You and your grand dames,
and your portable typewriter

377
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:37,337
and your desperate spinsters.
You're old-fashioned. You know that?

378
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,883
-Miss Olson?
-Yes?

379
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,964
Everyone is leaving
to get dressed for the party.

380
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,801
-Do you need me right now?
-No, you can go.

381
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,606
I'm sorry, Freddy.

382
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,228
Don't worry about it.

383
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,110
Is Violet coming?

384
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,650
She wouldn't miss it.

385
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,574
Thank you, dear.

386
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,328
You know Peter. He'd rather spend
every waking second right here in the city.

387
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,377
Who'd want to miss Christmas in New York?
Fifth Avenue...

388
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:58,126
Chestnuts roasting on a greasy man's
open street cart. My goodness.

389
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,674
We're going to the Bahamas
and there's nothing else to it.

390
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:05,304
Harry spent so much time in Los Angeles,
I figured I'd treat him to the mountains.

391
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:06,551
Stowe.

392
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,224
What about you, Don?
Do you have any plans?

393
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,469
Yes, heading to Acapulco.

394
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,182
Are you taking anyone special?

395
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,272
No.

396
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,815
Well, it's your own fault.

397
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,360
Yes, I pity him,
marooned in that sea of bikinis.

398
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,151
Merry Christmas.

399
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,404
-Nice to see you again.
-You as well, sir.

400
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,575
-Don.
-Don.

401
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,824
We're going to get something to drink.

402
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,420
Where the hell is he?

403
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,003
They are children,

404
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:45,962
and they can't accept the fact
that others have to make decisions for them.

405
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,174
So, we are not part
of this herd you're talking about.

406
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,769
You're from Great Britain. I'd think you'd
be familiar with the perils of socialism.

407
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:59,350
Civil rights is the beginning
of a slippery slope.

408
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:04,484
If they pass Medicare, they won't stop
until they ban personal property.

409
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,528
Storm our houses and rape our wives.

410
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,038
Man your battle stations!

411
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,784
Nice dress. Where's Mr. Holloway?

412
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,119
Saving lives.

413
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,042
Everyone, ladies, come on, let's go.

414
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,923
Don't forget it's a party.

415
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,236
Please, please.

416
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,860
I walked in here five minutes ago,
no one did anything.

417
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,567
Merry Christmas, Lee. That's quite a tan.

418
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,742
I work at it.

419
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,570
When can we expect something
for Lucky Strike

420
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,200
as good as "Let me out of here!"

421
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:57,283
Well, Glo-Coat told me
to swing for the fences.

422
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,919
Well, I didn't know I had to ask, Donny.

423
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,497
We have gifts, girls and games,
but first I'm gonna get you some food.

424
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,002
Well, that's a good idea, Red.

425
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,667
I've been drinking all day.

426
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:21,891
Don't turn on the lights, shithead.

427
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,488
Come on.

428
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,517
If you hear anything, run.
Don't worry about me.

429
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:41,304
Megan, can you get Mr. Garner a drink?

430
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,390
Where's Santa?

431
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,522
He didn't show,
but he did leave some presents.

432
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,739
Well, I could've sworn I conga'd by a suit.

433
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,533
-You want to be Santa?
-Hell, no.

434
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,445
How about you, Roger?

435
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,572
I would, but I'm allergic to velvet.

436
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,998
Come on. You'll do great.

437
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,000
-Are you serious?
-Damn straight.

438
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,459
I don't think so.

439
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,540
I'll do it.

440
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,966
-I'd love to be Santa.
-Yes.

441
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,385
Come on.
It'd take three of you to fill that suit.

442
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,218
Besides, everybody knows
Santa's got white hair.

443
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,970
Put it on, Roger.

444
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,264
Come on, Lee.

445
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,104
Put it on.

446
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,494
He's a hell of a sport.

447
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,170
Everybody just stay there.

448
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,053
Call the police.

449
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,053
-ls somebody in the house?
-Maybe it's a bear.

450
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,264
Hello?

451
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,643
I'm guessing it's kids.

452
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,771
Let me look around the house.

453
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,728
-Hello?
-Just stay here.

454
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,233
Where's your lovely wife, Lane?

455
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,699
She and my son are in London.
I shall be joining them soon enough.

456
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,032
Mine's in Florida.
I guess we'll suffer through, eh, Jeeves?

457
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,834
Merry Christmas!

458
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,589
It's hard to tell if he's Father Christmas
or Father Time.

459
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,920
Merry Christmas!

460
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,433
That's a big bag, Roger.
Don't want you to have a third heart attack.

461
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,769
Right, honey?

462
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,140
What have we here?

463
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,442
What do all the good boys and girls
want for Christmas?

464
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,194
Lucky Strike!

465
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,818
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

466
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,150
Don't smoke those all at once.

467
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:05,578
And I have a very special present for
a little boy who knows he's been naughty.

468
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,453
Lee.

469
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,916
You didn't need to do that.

470
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,497
Yes, we did.

471
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,719
-Look at that.
-it's a Polaroid.

472
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,593
Thank you.

473
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,931
It reminds me of when I was a kid.
Remember that?

474
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,648
You'd ask for something, you'd get it
and it made you happy.

475
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,740
Merry Christmas!

476
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:43,693
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

477
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,861
Merry Christmas, Don.

478
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,915
There's eggs in my bed!

479
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,499
You can sleep in our room if you want.

480
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,169
My room's fine.

481
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:18,612
Anybody home?

482
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,488
Not for much longer.

483
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:25,574
I can't leave until Geoff and Bert Cooper
figure out how to take food from children.

484
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,992
Well, if anyone can do it...

485
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,458
How many Christmas parties
do you have to go to?

486
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,831
I pity you. Please, sit down.

487
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,010
No, I just want to make sure
there were no problems.

488
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,388
You really are a full-service company.

489
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,718
It's just you didn't take the test and I know
you're the creative shaman around here,

490
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,768
but you walked out of my presentation.

491
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:57,855
I'm disappointed. I thought you came in
to flirt, but you came in to tight.

492
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,528
You have to know
I found out all I could about you.

493
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:07,904
Your work is very interesting and I guess
I was hoping you thought mine was.

494
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:11,783
It's not personal. I just don't think
you can learn much about people that way.

495
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,955
I learned a lot about you.

496
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,628
You're the kind of man
who doesn't want to take the test.

497
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,625
I'm sorry. I just don't see
how knowing about my childhood

498
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,301
is gonna help sell floor wax.

499
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,385
I saw that ad.
It's all about somebody's childhood.

500
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,476
Look, we're both in the same business

501
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,809
and I'm not embarrassed to say
it's about helping people

502
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,357
somehow to sort out their deepest conflict.

503
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,025
And what is that?

504
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:45,403
In a nutshell, it all comes down to
"What I want versus what's expected of me."

505
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,737
That's true.

506
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:52,489
I know it's true,

507
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,951
and you would've known it's true
if you'd stayed for my presentation.

508
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,336
Want to get some dinner or something?

509
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:06,466
No, thank you. But apology accepted.

510
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:14,141
Look, I know the holidays are hard
in your situation, but don't worry.

511
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,766
You'll be married again in a year.

512
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,271
What?

513
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,896
I'm sorry. I always forget.
Nobody wants to think they're a type.

514
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,651
Merry Christmas.

515
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,941
Merry Christmas.

516
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:34,657
Harry. Your turn.

517
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,453
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

518
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,071
Shit.

519
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,924
I don't see anything. Here they are.

520
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,504
I got them.

521
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:32,635
Great.

522
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:40,889
He forgot his keys.

523
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,191
I'll give you a half an hour
and then we'll meet you at Chumley's.

524
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,735
Better make it an hour.
Might have to get some food in him.

525
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,862
He's pathetic.

526
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,785
Hello?

527
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,454
-I'm really sorry.
-it's okay.

528
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,715
Switched my plans a little bit.

529
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,058
I'm getting you Aspirin. Don't say no.

530
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,641
Top-right cabinet.

531
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,061
-How about some food?
-No.

532
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,760
-Thank you.
-Okay. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

533
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:09,690
Don't.

534
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,940
Don't what?

535
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:22,949
Oh, God.

536
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,970
-You smell so good.
-I feel dizzy.

537
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,721
My goodness.

538
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,183
I know.

539
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,446
I'm supposed to meet somebody.

540
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,380
I should really go.

541
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,719
-You sure?
-Yes.

542
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,951


543
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,124
I understand. it's okay.

544
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,868
Okay.

545
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,087
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.

546
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:12,619
Freddy.

547
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:16,836
I'm sorry I'm at your desk.
It was the cleanest spot in the office.

548
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,303
Are you okay? You didn't come to the party.

549
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,678
It's been my experience
that when they give you that Santa suit,

550
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,810
there's usually a bottle
already in the pocket.

551
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,567
Thank God.

552
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,737
I don't want to worry
that every time I hurt your feelings

553
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,314
you're gonna start drinking again.

554
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,695
Then why don't you stop
hurting my feelings?

555
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,915
I'm sorry.

556
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,294
I'm sorry I said you were old-fashioned.

557
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,216
And I'm sorry
I said you wanted to get married.

558
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,008
I do want to get married.

559
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,215
You've got to work less and find somebody.

560
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,725
I have a boyfriend.

561
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,560
Is it serious?

562
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,143
I don't know yet.

563
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:16,474
But he won't leave me alone.

564
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,065
I was that way with Violet.

565
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,105
Insatiable.

566
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,489
Freddy, I don't want to talk about this.

567
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,570
Hey, you brought it up.

568
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,913
I haven't done much work on this,
I have to be honest,

569
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,539
and I need to get some coffee.

570
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,704
You'll be fine.

571
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,388
I don't want to be alone on New Year's Eve.

572
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,684
My two cents?

573
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,104
If you're gonna marry him,
you can't do anything

574
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,897
or he won't respect you.

575
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,105
What if I don't know?

576
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:05,024
Well, you can't lead him on. That is
physically very uncomfortable, you know.

577
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,782
It's not a joke.

578
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,338
Did you enjoy the fuhrer's birthday?

579
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,594
May he live for 1,000 years.

580
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:36,555
My father used to say this is the greatest job
in the world except for one thing,

581
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,059
the clients.

582
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,900
Good morning.

583
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,703
-Did you make it home last night?
-I did.

584
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,159
I did.

585
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,454
Come inside.

586
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,086
-What's all this?
-For your children.

587
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,465
I bought them the other day,
but I finally got them wrapped.

588
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:09,629
Thank you.

589
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,173
Do you want me to get the door?

590
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,303
No.

591
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:15,889
Do you need some coffee?

592
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,229
I had some. It was quite a party.

593
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,308
I really overdid it.

594
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:23,976
Me, too.

595
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,148


596
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,906
Thank you for bringing my keys.
I really appreciate it.

597
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:41,377
I've probably taken advantage
of your kindness on too many occasions.

598
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,914
Excuse me?

599
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,629
I just wanted to say thank you
for bringing my keys.

600
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:54,632
Okay.

601
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,140
I know we talked about
how tough things are for the firm,

602
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,856
but I wanted you to know...

603
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,859
Well, here's the bonus we talked about.

604
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,156
Merry Christmas.

605
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,251
Thank you.

606
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,874
Anything else for right now?

607
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,005
No.

608
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:38,991
Hey.

609
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,705
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, of course.

610
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,454
Do you feel different?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
