1
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:43,966
First, I want to assure you that no one
at my agency knows about this meeting.

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,388
-I appreciate that.
-I'm here to help.

3
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:52,603
I have my own thoughts,
but how would you describe your...

4
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,057
Well, your current frustrations?

5
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,478
During the war, Heinz was all about beans,

6
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,154
but now, obviously, ketchup is king.

7
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,826
I'm happy for the company, but I'm
afraid we've become the fading older sister.

8
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:12,369
So ketchup, chili sauce and soup
end up over at DDB,

9
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,954
and vinegar, sauces and beans
end up at Ketchum MacLeod.

10
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,420
I don't know why I'm disappointed,
I asked for straightforward.

11
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,714
I just thought they would talk me out of it.

12
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,292
They obviously don't know
what kind of client you are.

13
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,005
Well, I've been working a long time.

14
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:32,226
I know that despite the public's imagination,
food is cyclical.

15
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,598
I don't mean seasonal.

16
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:38,057
But I mean, literally, there's a time for beans,
and there's a time for ketchup.

17
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,736
But I don't have that time,
so I wanna force the issue.

18
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,529
You know, something inventive.

19
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,483
Humor worked with the pickles,
but pickles are funny.

20
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:51,287
The way beans are funny, we can't use that.
We have to fight it, actually.

21
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,491
Well, it's very possible that Heinz beans
don't need to be funny,

22
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,669
because they're a food, not a condiment.
They're substantial.

23
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,835
You know,
I'd love to have that conversation.

24
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,292
And the reason I agreed to meet with you is
because I hoped it would spark something,

25
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:09,505
and maybe six to eight months from now
you can call me with a humdinger.

26
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,848
How about six days?

27
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,593
No. No, this is my point.

28
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,646
I want to move,
but there's a lot that goes with it.

29
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,224
There's a breaking-in period that's months.

30
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,402
-That's true, but...
-I'm sorry to be so blunt,

31
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,073
but I don't know that your company
will be here in six months.

32
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,655
I do.

33
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,403
That's what I'm hoping.

34
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:38,038
That's why my answer is not "No,"
it's just "Not now."

35
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,044
So where's the harm in coming in
and hearing some ideas?

36
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,670
Because I can't afford to move my business
a third time in two years.

37
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,251
I just can't.

38
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,128
I see.

39
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,680
So, that's where we are.

40
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,386
Hold on.

41
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:58,183
Raymond, I will have an exciting idea.
I happen to know that.

42
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,436
Would a discounted commission
make up for the break-in period?

43
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,688
I bet I could get a date
with your mother right now.

44
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,241
Well, you can see
why I don't want to let this go.

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,873
Look, Don, you're a hell of an idea man,
but let the account boys do this part.

46
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,626
I wish you the best of luck.

47
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,046
Thank you. It was really great to meet you.

48
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,090
Excuse me, waiter.

49
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,259
Sally, Bobby!

50
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,361
You're filthy.

51
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,652
Can I take it away from him?

52
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,955
The spoon or the screaming, take your pick.

53
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,751
I want two hot dogs.

54
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,624
Your eyes are bigger than your stomach.

55
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,580
How come we never eat with Henry?

56
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,334
First of all, he works until late
and you're always saying, "I'm hungry."

57
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,215
Second of all, you don't eat the same food.

58
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,921
I'll try new food.

59
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,882
Would you like to eat with Henry?

60
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,849
Why don't Bobby and Gene eat first,
and I'll wait to eat with you and Henry?

61
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,308
Okay. Let me think about it.

62
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,434
Okay.

63
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,235
You're paying me to assess your situation,

64
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:35,033
but I could've told you
from three blocks away

65
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,113
that signing new business,
no matter what the size, is of the essence.

66
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,373
Not only because your billings
have shrunk by 50%,

67
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,250
but because there's not much time
before you'll be perceived as stagnant,

68
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,377
or worse, decaying.

69
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,459
Listen, Doctor,
we know there's a black spot on the x-ray.

70
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,385
You don't have to
Keep tapping your finger on it.

71
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:58,932
I recommend that you do
what you do best, cigarettes.

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,519
You understand the FTC.
You understand the Surgeon General.

73
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,939
You have a team in place
with account management

74
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,109
and media expertise
which is up and running.

75
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,528
And, of course, you have Don.

76
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:17,735
You are a certain kind of girl,
and tobacco is your ideal boyfriend.

77
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,699
Can you get us a date?

78
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,449
Philip Morris is introducing
a new brand for young women,

79
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,252
hoping to have it on the market
in 18 months,

80
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,171
and they'd like a new agency on it
from the ground floor.

81
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,791
How much is it?

82
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,999
Close to $5 million.

83
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,423
It's a start.

84
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,045
Wonderful.

85
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,302
And what stage of the process
has your influence bought us?

86
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,514
A meeting. No one else has one.

87
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,355
We will listen more than we will speak.

88
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,683
Like a good girlfriend.

89
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,772
Sounds great.

90
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,354
I concur.

91
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,950
All I'm saying is we should be going
after something as big as what we had.

92
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,245
It'd cost a fortune to pursue
one when it's in review.

93
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,789
And they're impossible to pry away.

94
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,252
Our day-to-day payroll will be beyond us
by the next billing cycle.

95
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,671
We should start thinking about
reducing staff

96
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,464
and subletting the square footage.

97
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,340
Why even have an office?
Why don't we just work out of a cab?

98
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,174
And where does that leave me?

99
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,804
Trying to get my calls returned with
all the buying power of Secor Laxative?

100
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,262
We gave him Don and a finder's fee.
He should've aimed higher.

101
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,729
I just left Geyer for this.

102
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,602
Do you think those clients
are in love with me?

103
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,935
I'm getting married in October!
It's gonna be barefoot in the park.

104
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,728
These things go in streaks.

105
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,609
And Don Draper with a cigarette company?

106
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,362
We get this vote of confidence,
and we move from there.

107
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,402
Marlboro was their women's cigarette.

108
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,824
Well, they certainly ran away from that
in the right direction.

109
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,837
You know, beans, vinegars and sauces
was very impressed.

110
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,214
Thank you for that,
but thank you much more for this.

111
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,386
This is what I was hoping for.

112
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,340
Good. Geoff's excited.

113
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,511
Study up.

114
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,435
I have dinner plans but call me tonight,
even if it's just to work.

115
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,527
It's a summer practice helmet.
it's not as good.

116
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,656
It smells.

117
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,918
Well, you're there all the time.
What do you talk about?

118
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,039
Didn't you go?

119
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,416
Yeah, but psychiatrists are easy to fool.

120
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,381
Dr. Edna's smart.

121
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,629
She tell you to kiss your mom's ass?

122
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,509
No.

123
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,797
So who's smarter, me or her?

124
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,554
You want one?

125
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,724
No.

126
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,182
Do you talk to your mom about me?

127
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,394
I did, and I don't anymore.

128
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,532
She doesn't like me. She thinks...

129
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,989
She doesn't like kids.

130
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,995
That's not true.

131
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,406
You're the one who's always saying
how mean she is.

132
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,325
So what?

133
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,177
-I've gotta go.
-Okay.

134
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,055
See you later, alligator.

135
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,686
Don.

136
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,232
Midge.

137
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,993
I just came out from a meeting
at a magazine related to Time Life

138
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,871
and I saw this dashing figure.

139
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,829
Where are you going
with so much purpose?

140
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,378
Home. You look good.

141
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,760
I'm skinny. Starving artist.

142
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,004
-Did you move here?
-Yes.

143
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,591
Well, I have my own firm now.

144
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,760
Draper, Draper and Draper?

145
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,270
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

146
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,765
Well, it sounds impressive.

147
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,856
There are good days and bad days,
like anything else.

148
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,313
So you wouldn't happen to need
any freelance artists, would you?

149
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:27,155
I wish I could help right now.
Maybe in six months.

150
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,656
You can use me as a reference.

151
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,617
Really?

152
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,121
I thought I would've run into you
in The Village.

153
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,377
I'm always expecting to see you in the park.

154
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:43,425
What are you doing in The Village?
Admiring the wildlife?

155
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,670
I live there, on Waverly.

156
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,174
Yeah.

157
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,309
So what's the rush to go home? Come over.

158
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,401
I have a big meeting tomorrow.
Maybe some other time.

159
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,649
Not even to meet my husband?

160
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,908
-Really?
-Well, it's not romantic.

161
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,035
We just got married for the bread.

162
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,992
We'll eat, you'll buy a painting,
I'll cheer you up.

163
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:23,086
Look, I lost my purse.
At least give me a ride downtown.

164
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,503
Okay.

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,266
I told her I brushed my teeth,
but she said I still smelled like spaghetti.

166
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,766
And what did you do?

167
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,311
I brushed my teeth again.

168
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,150
And what did she do?

169
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:46,856
She doesn't care what the truth is
as long as I do what she says.

170
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,357
Got any sevens?

171
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,987
Nope. Go fish.

172
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,996
I hate sevens.

173
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,702
Why?

174
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,583
I just do.

175
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:04,752
You know, I'm very proud
of how you found a way to behave so well,

176
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,131
even when you get so angry
at your mother sometimes.

177
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,880
It's hard to control ourselves
when we get so angry.

178
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,974
She just doesn't know that I'm mad.

179
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,473
As long as you know it.

180
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,644
I told you your mom acts that way
because she has stresses.

181
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,818
Not because you're bad
or that you did anything wrong.

182
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,065
I know.

183
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,152
Do you have any aces?

184
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,904
No, go fish.

185
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,996
So now that you're back in school,

186
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,790
we probably should be seeing
a little less of each other.

187
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,493
Just one day a week.

188
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,169
So that you can ride your bike,

189
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,965
and be with your friends
and be in the ballet recital.

190
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,916
Okay.

191
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,962
Do you have any threes?

192
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,228
I said I'm very proud of you.
Did you hear that?

193
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,520
Do you have any jacks?

194
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,241
Perry, we have company.

195
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,952
This is my friend, Don.

196
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,658
Perry. Nice to meet you.

197
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,539
-Sorry to drop in,
-Oh, no.

198
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,791
Why don't you offer Don a drink?

199
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,256
Sure. Don, what are you gonna have?

200
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:33,303
I have vodka or brown?

201
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,088
Whiskey's good.

202
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,639
Good. Good.

203
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,309
I'll get a couple of glasses.

204
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,433
So you're a playwright?

205
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,810
When we met,
I said he looked like Brendan Behan.

206
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,983
You said Dylan Thomas.

207
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,486
Here we go.

208
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,028
To welcome company.

209
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,956
Let me go freshen up
and make sure we have toilet paper.

210
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,220
So, Don, let me open your eyes for a minute.
Come here.

211
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,972
Can you believe this?

212
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,438
-What's it called?
-Number four

213
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,691
The whole thing is about what she sees
when she closes her eyes.

214
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,365
It's part of this thing that she's doing.
It's called an afterimage.

215
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,613
What's more real?

216
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,701
It's nice.

217
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,497
You know, I have a price list somewhere.

218
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,495
Of course, you know,
whatever you're willing to pay.

219
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,623
I mean,
I Know she'd love for you to have one.

220
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,585
Let me think about it.

221
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:57,087
You know, it's not hard to see things
are a little tough around here,

222
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,758
but she digs you.

223
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,804
And I could tell you
she'd do anything if you bought one.

224
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,606
Are you sure about that?

225
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,642
We're not possessive,

226
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,229
and you should've heard how excited
she was when she tracked you down.

227
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:15,897
What?

228
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,445
You know, the look on her face
when she walked in here with you.

229
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,992
See, I knew I shouldn't have left
you two alone.

230
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,328
Are you kidding?
We're getting along famously.

231
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,787
You know what?

232
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,374
I'm gonna get some groceries
and whip up a great meal.

233
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,462
Midge? Honey?

234
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,006
She lost her purse.

235
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,429
Right.

236
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,056
Don, don't.

237
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:50,811
My father owned a restaurant.
I can make chicken cordon bleu.

238
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,359
Here. How about that?

239
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,778
$107

240
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,483
Well, okay.

241
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,237
You two sit tight. I'll be right back.

242
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,463
-He's very interesting.
-He's an idiot.

243
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:21,137
He's just gonna go out
and put that in his arm.

244
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,426
And you could've gotten
so much more from me.

245
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,020
That's why you tracked me down,
like James Bond.

246
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:35,144
God! He's such an idiot.

247
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,445
I just wanted you to buy a painting.

248
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,994
I swear.

249
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,170
What's it like?

250
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:01,508
It's like drinking 100 bottles of whiskey

251
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,839
while someone licks your tits.

252
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,352
I can see it's very good.

253
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,479
He said it would help me
take my mind off my work.

254
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,110
Turns out, it's a full-time job.

255
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,277
Why don't you stop?

256
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,369
I know it's bad for me, but...

257
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,868
It's heroin, Don.

258
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,081
I just can't stop.

259
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:43,136
I am glad to see you, you know?

260
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,695
This is $300.

261
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,742
You know, for Number four over there.

262
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,246
Don.

263
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,747
What am I gonna do with a check?

264
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,925
Here's $120 in cash.

265
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,736
Do you think my work's any good?

266
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,572
Does it matter?

267
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,875
You know, I don't even have car fare.

268
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:04,300
You can walk across the park.
Do some advertising for me.

269
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,048
Like a sandwich board.

270
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,514
It's really great to see you, Don.

271
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,572
I'm glad you haven't changed.

272
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,165
It was the way he slammed the car door
like that.

273
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,913
It was so dismissive.

274
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,838
It reminded me of Don,
but, of course, it wasn't.

275
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,592
When I confronted him later,
it turned out he hadn't heard me.

276
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,840
That's what he said, anyway.

277
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,839
Well, you learned something, didn't you?

278
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,558
I did.

279
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,225
Our time is almost up,

280
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:59,931
so I thought that I should tell you that

281
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,109
I believe Sally has made
wonderful progress,

282
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,939
and that I'd like to reduce her sessions
to once a week and see where we are.

283
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,859
So she's cured?

284
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,534
She's not better. She ran away.

285
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,124
And she understands
what she did was wrong,

286
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,543
and she's been very responsible since.

287
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,165
Her life is chaotic,

288
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,548
and I'm afraid of losing this influence.

289
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,045
I've noticed that every time
you come in here,

290
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,213
you have many things on your mind.

291
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,639
And I feel that
you should have your own time

292
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,063
where you get to say
everything you want to say.

293
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,900
I have a very talented colleague,
Dr. Evelyn Shapiro, whom I can recommend.

294
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,027
Why can't I talk to you?

295
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,191
Betty, you can talk to me but, you know,

296
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,068
I'm a child psychiatrist.

297
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,740
Well, I don't need a psychiatrist. I just...

298
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,831
Obviously, I'm willing to do whatever
you recommend as Sally progresses.

299
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,876
And I would hope, of course,

300
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:16,220
that if she continues to make progress,
that we could continue to discuss that.

301
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,105
Of course.

302
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,768
So I'll keep you in the books for next month.

303
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,191
If you think so.

304
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,747
Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.

305
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,623
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather.

306
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,797
-You wanted to see me?
-I did.

307
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,375
-Did you do all the reading?
-Yes.

308
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,177
If strategy comes up,
and it usually doesn't at this point,

309
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,971
what do you think they think
the strength is of this product?

310
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,101
Well, as you know, it's pointless
to get women to switch from men's brands.

311
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,268
Nobody switches.

312
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,265
They're probably looking for a new way
to give them out for free.

313
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,478
Sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Draper, Dr. Atherton is on his way up,

314
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,484
the partners are gathering in the lobby,

315
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,361
and Dr. Miller called to say, "Break a leg."

316
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,817
Thank you.

317
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,986
What were you saying?

318
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,578
I was saying you're gonna do great.

319
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,424
Morning.

320
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,595
I'm afraid I have some unfortunate news.

321
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,062
They canceled the meeting.

322
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,393
-Are you kidding me?
-What?

323
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,317
They decided to give it to Leo Burnett.

324
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,863
Burnett has Marlboro already.

325
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,236
I thought they wanted a fresh start with this.

326
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,362
So did I.

327
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,119
They're excited to see
where you are in six months.

328
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,243
Six months means never.
They're letting us die.

329
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,165
I thought this was a sure thing.

330
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,164
Down the road, perhaps.

331
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,704
There's no reason to be discouraged.

332
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,755
The wind is blowing ice cold out there.

333
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,925
We can't even get a meeting
with a damn tobacco account!

334
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,546
Take it inside.

335
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,641
You're an asshole, you know that?

336
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,651
Mr. Crane, out.

337
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,831
They can't even dignify us with an excuse?

338
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,158
They don't need an excuse.

339
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:50,040
It's because we're desperate.
They can smell it on us.

340
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,998
We reek of it like some sweaty salesman
knocking on his last door!

341
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,003
Because we're going after scraps.

342
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,130
What about United Airlines,
General Motors?

343
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,507
-Do you think that's easier?
-Then what? You have a plan?

344
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,596
I'm out there
beating the bushes every day for anything.

345
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,305
-You should try it.
-Just out of caution, I met with the bank.

346
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,220
They've agreed to extend our line of credit,

347
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,850
but they would like us
to post some collateral.

348
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,307
You went to the bank?
There's a vote of confidence.

349
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:14,436
$100,000 each from the senior partners,

350
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,773
and $50,000 from Mr. Campbell and I
would buy us six months or so,

351
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:21,780
provided we make
a drastic reduction in staff.

352
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,036
$50,000? Absolutely not.

353
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,039
It's an obligation of your contract.

354
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,912
All we need is a bridge
to cold and flu season

355
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,459
and Vicks will take us to the holidays.

356
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,454
Sugarberry Hams will pick up. Samsonite...

357
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,915
It's a hardship for me as well,
but it's a necessity.

358
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,625
We should move.
We should never have been here.

359
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,881
You think we look desperate now?

360
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,305
Well, if you figure it out,
you Know where to find me.

361
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,007
For a little while, anyway.

362
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:55,143
And then I was floating over town.
Standing straight up, not like Superman.

363
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,614
Only it wasn't Ossining, it was London.
Like Mary Poppins.

364
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,696
Do you want the backwash?

365
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:12,168
I fly in some of my dreams.
It feels like being in the ocean.

366
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:17,214
I just felt like I was going to heaven,
except I don't believe in it.

367
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,835
You don't?
Then what happens when you die? Nothing?

368
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,673
It doesn't really bother me,
except for it's forever.

369
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,509
When I think about forever, I get upset.

370
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:33,856
Like the Land O' Lakes butter
has that Indian girl, sitting, holding a box.

371
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,268
And it has a picture of her on it,
holding a box.

372
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,275
With a picture of her on it, holding a box.

373
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,068
Have you ever noticed that?

374
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,613
I wish you wouldn't have said that.

375
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,159
Sorry. I have to go.

376
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,540
Yeah, I should, too.

377
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,836
I'll save my Fritos for you.

378
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,309
-May I speak with you?
-Are you busy?

379
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,728
No. Do you want one?

380
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,221
No.

381
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,689
Philip Morris set up the meeting,
then told Leo Burnett about it

382
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,064
to leverage a sweeter deal.

383
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:24,566
So they used us.
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

384
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,739
Everyone at Burnett is already bragging
about how we never even got a meeting.

385
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,699
What do you want?

386
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,533
I wanna know why I'm being punished
for being the only business left around here-

387
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,037
We're all being punished.

388
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,918
I don't have that kind of money.

389
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,589
Pete, I'm doing everything I can.
Get me in a room.

390
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,760
-Miss Olson to see you.
-Come in!

391
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,348
Everybody's waiting in the conference room.

392
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:51,884
For what?

393
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:57,269
Well, we were all gonna leave when you left,
but you didn't go, so what should we do?

394
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,101
-I don't care.
-What happened?

395
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,937
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

396
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,276
What are we gonna do?

397
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,777
Peggy, it's not your problem.

398
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,535
I know,
but I have been thinking about the company,

399
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,534
and I was wondering
what you thought about...

400
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,583
You know,
why don't we just change our name?

401
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,459
If this was a dog food,
we'd change the name.

402
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,171
We can't start over. We just started.

403
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,248
You always say, "if you don't like
what they're saying about you,

404
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,801
-"change the conversation."
-To what?

405
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,753
What they're saying about us is true.

406
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,968
So there's nothing we can do?

407
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,300
Sure there is. We're gonna sit at our desks
and keep typing

408
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,886
while the walls fall down around us,
because we're creative.

409
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,518
The least important
most important thing there is.

410
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,787
You can't slam the door like that.

411
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,079
Why didn't you call me back?
The bank called.

412
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,877
Something about a loan application?

413
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,547
-They called here?
-Yes.

414
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,714
Do you have something you want to tell me?

415
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,379
It's not important.

416
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,844
To think you still want to surprise me
after five years of marriage.

417
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,603
When can I start looking?
I'm so in love with Greenwich.

418
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,019
We're not buying a house, Trudy.

419
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:30,442
The partners each need to put in a lump sum
to keep the payroll we have going,

420
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,494
so people don't lose their jobs.

421
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,747
What? How much?

422
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,039
Well, it's $50,000,
and we have $22,000 in the bank,

423
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:44,713
not counting the baby gifts,
which will remain for the baby.

424
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,797
It's all for the baby,
for Tammy to have a yard to run around in.

425
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,220
Central Park was good enough for me.

426
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:55,516
When you bet big and lose,
you don't double down.

427
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,970
It's in my contract. I'll lose my partnership.

428
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,350
You'll lose your stateroom on the Titanic?

429
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,559
You are forbidden
to give anything more to that company.

430
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,894
You don't get to forbid me.

431
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,695
Lower your voice!

432
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,275
And don't even think
about asking my father.

433
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,942
”Why I'm quitting tobacco."

434
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,404
"Recently, my advertising agency

435
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:40,113
”ended a long relationship
with Lucky Strike cigarettes.

436
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,832
"And i'm relieved.

437
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,838
”For over 25 years, we devoted
ourselves to peddling a product

438
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,508
”for which good work is irrelevant,

439
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,222
”because people can't stop themselves
from buying it.

440
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,679
”The product that never improves,

441
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:04,970
”causes illness and makes people unhappy.

442
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,109
”But there was money in it.

443
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,187
"A lot of money.

444
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:21,032
”In fact, our entire business depended on it.

445
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,243
”We knew it wasn't good for us,
but we couldn't stop.

446
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:33,044
"And then, when Lucky Strike moved
their business elsewhere,

447
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:37,344
”l realized here was my chance
to be someone who can sleep at night

448
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:41,386
”because I know
what i'm selling doesn't kill my customers.

449
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,800
"So as of today,
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce

450
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:48,060
"will no longer take tobacco accounts.
We know it's gonna be hard.

451

”If you're interested in cigarette work,
here's a list of agencies that do it well:

"BBDO, Leo Burnett, McCann Erickson,

453
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,067
"Cutler Gleason and Chaough
and Benton and Bowles."

454
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:02,745
"As for us, we welcome all other business,

455
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,743
"because we're certain that our best work
is still ahead of us.

456
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,621
"Sincerely, Donald F. Draper,

457
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,920
"Creative Director,
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce."

458
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,885
-Good morning, Don.
-Stan.

459
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,847
Good morning.

460
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,226
Good morning. Any calls?

461
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:32,270
Yes, quite a few.
Mostly reporters and citizens, Dr. Miller.

462
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,850
Anyone else?

463
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:39,657
Someone named Emerson Foote and
people from those agencies you mentioned.

464
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:42,776
They're looking for you.

465
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,866
Can you get Dr. Miller?

466
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,328
Somebody used your name
to end our business in the newspaper.

467
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,835
-it's not you, is it?
-It's suicide!

468
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,134
It's insane! How the hell could you do this?
Why would you do this?

469
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,711
Because someone had to do something.

470
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:04,094
You put the company name on it.
You should've consulted us.

471
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,721
Why?
To evaluate its strengths and weaknesses?

472
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,974
To knock it down to risk versus reward?
It's done!

473
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,896
And I slept last night
for the first time in a month.

474
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,474
You slept? Really?

475
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,400
You weren't smiling,
thinking about the taste of shit

476
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,443
that would be in everybody's mouth
over breakfast today?

477
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,068
No one asked you
to euthanize this company.

478
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,650
What did you expect,
for us to pat you on the back?

479
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,860
Don't you realize the clients
are all going to think

480
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,445
you could turn on them at any minute?

481
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:30,499
I'm not going to explain to you what I did.
It's an ad for this agency.

482
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,872
If you don't understand it,
then you shouldn't be in this business.

483
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:37,457
You humiliated us
by not putting our names on it!

484
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,296
You left us with this hypocrisy!

485
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,592
So deny it!

486
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,087
I did what I thought was best
for the company.

487
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,592
You can either back me or not.

488
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:49,302
You did what was best for you,
because you're impatient and childish.

489
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,391
You had a tantrum on a full page
in The New York Times.

490
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,475
So no one is happy about this?

491
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,144
I don't know.

492
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,231
It's good enough to be the reason
this place went down anymore.

493
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,529
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

494
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,445
There's someone calling from
Senator Kennedy's office.

495
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,530
Robert Kennedy wants to speak with you.

496
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,962
Please hold for the Senator.

497
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,090
Ls this here Don Draper?

498
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,046
-Yes.
-This is Bobby Kennedy.

499
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,473
How are you this lovely morning?

500
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,722
I'm well. Thank you, Senator.

501
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,144
Bobby, please.

502
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,939
Listen, I just wanted to say that I admire

503
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:40,064
your fortitude and vigor
and standing up to what I consider to be

504
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:44,273
one of the great menaces to this civilization
as we know it.

505
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,070
That's very flattering-

506
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,822
I have one question:

507
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,620
Does your company represent
Secor Laxatives?

508
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,163
Yes. Yes, we do.

509
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,082
Well, are you gonna be writing
anything against them?

510
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:59,505
Because I want to make it clear
that I am firmly anti-laxative-

511
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,171
Who the hell is this?

512
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,427
Teddy Chaough.

513
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,305
Thanks for sticking my name in there
with the big boys.

514
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,681
A full-page ad in The Times.
What did that run you?

515
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,557
A little mix-up there.
That was Eunice Kennedy.

516
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,314
Keep joking. You're cynical and craven.

517
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,781
Tobacco put a roof over your head
and it fed your children.

518
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,198
And then it killed my business.

519
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,653
I never thought you had the stomach
for a partnership.

520
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,373
I'm no longer a part of this agency.

521
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,704
You there, get my shoes.

522
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,251
Bert, calm down.

523
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,546
I will not. We've created a monster.

524
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,223
I've already informed the other partners.

525
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:56,099
I'll need your contribution
by close of business, as it were.

526
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,600
You know this could work.

527
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,150
Do you realize
I've just moved my family back here?

528
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,575
I'm terribly sorry about that.

529
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,243
Did you get Dr. Miller?

530
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,993
Yes, but you were on with...
You were on the phone.

531
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,618
She said she'd stop by later.

532
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,376
Okay, that'll be all.

533
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,705
By the way, I loved the letter.

534
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,750
I love that you stand for something.

535
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,177
Megan, that's not really what it's about.

536
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:34,467
I know that part. I know it was about
"he didn't dump me, I dumped him."

537
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,766
I just love that you did it.

538
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,064
It feels different around here.

539
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,694
Thank you.

540
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,991
-So who else called?
-Everyone who's anyone.

541
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,039
"Smokey the Bear, Smokey Robinson,

542
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,871
"Chiquita Banana, Aunt Jemima."

543
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,204
Is he gonna quit smoking?

544
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,922
You're an idiot.

545
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,126
I heard from all my clients this morning,
mostly out of morbid curiosity.

546
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,053
But one tning's for sure, tney're not talking
about Lucky Strike anymore.

547
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,090
Well, I think that was the whole idea.

548
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:19,053
They're gonna fire everybody,
or worse, make me fire everybody.

549
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,809
Well, it's been a pleasure
working with you all.

550
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,016
I wish you the best of luck.

551
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,733
I didn't think they'd start with him.

552
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,824
Peggy, Mr. Draper wants to see you.

553
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,864
Okay.

554
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,668
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

555
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,091
-Should I close the door?
-Yes.

556
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,769
Should I sit down?

557
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:03,392
Who can you live without?

558
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:11,113
Good. I mean, not good, but, you know...

559
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:16,697
Well, Danny, obviously,
though he's Kind of grown on me.

560
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,121
Lane sent over a memo with suggestions.

561
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:24,246
"All of the tobacco people,
Mark Coyle, Wuzna..."

562
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,417
The Polish kid, "Danny and Bill."

563
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,254
That's a lot of people.

564
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,552
Are we going under?

565
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,551
No. Of course not.

566
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,309
I just wanted to give you notice
so when they all come to you,

567
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,601
you'll know what's going on.

568
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,229
Okay.

569
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,349
So?

570
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,645
You haven't said anything about the letter.

571
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:56,320
I thought you didn't go in
for those kinds of shenanigans.

572
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,769
Sally Draper.

573
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,019
Stop, both of you.

574
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,898
What are you doing here?

575
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,194
You stay away from her! You hear me?

576
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,197
Let's go.

577
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,121
We're not going back for your bike.

578
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,753
I told you, he's my friend.
We don't do anything.

579
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,300
That boy is bad.

580
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,800
No, he's not.

581
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,964
Believe me. I know him better than you do.

582
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,174
You don't know him at all.

583
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,554
Go to your room.

584
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:17,905
You stopped by.

585
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,529
Yes. I'm glad to see you smiling.

586
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,946
Well, they all want to kill me,
but I have a bodyguard.

587
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,201
-Can I get you anything?
-No, thank you.

588
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,008
What's this?

589
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,920
My things.

590
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,804
We had to resign.

591
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,016
Geoff Atherton
wants another cigarette account someday.

592
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,268
I'm so sorry. I didn't think about that.

593
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,190
I know.

594
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,023
I'm really sorry.

595
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,123
So,

596
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,458
you're gonna make it through this day,
then you're going to leave this office,

597
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:18,167
meet me for dinner in the open,
wherever I want,

598
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,468
and we're gonna talk about anything
but work,

599
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,005
because we can do that now.

600
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,300
It's a fair trade.

601
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,654
La Caravelle, 8:00?

602
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,493
Sure.

603
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,367
Have your girl make reservations.

604
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,510
Just wanted to say goodbye.

605
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:10,602
No. What happened?

606
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,354
Tobacco is very touchy.

607
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,936
Who's gonna do our research?

608
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,360
You know, I just lost one of my best jobs-

609
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:23,941
No, I mean, I love working with you.

610
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,860
Would you have a drink with me?

611
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,864
-I don't want to linger.
-Not right now. Just...

612
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,791
I hate to think I'm not gonna see you.

613
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,084
That's sweet.

614
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,662
No, I mean it.

615
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,456
You do your job so well,

616
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,927
and they respect you,
and you don't have to play any games.

617
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,213
I didn't know that was possible.

618
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,469
Is that what it looks like?

619
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,350
I'm sure we'll work together again,
somewhere.

620
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,779
Hello there.

621
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,581
So I'm home early for a family dinner.

622
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,580
They couldn't wait. We can eat later.

623
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,049
I'll eat with this crowd.

624
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,509
Well, I had quite a day.

625
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,935
That doesn't sound good.

626
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:39,437
It's this neighborhood.
It's being taken over by low-caliber people.

627
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,772
I think it's time for us to move.

628
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,197
Great. You know how I feel about it.

629
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,362
I like that place in Rye.

630
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,743
Rye? Isn't that where Playland is?

631
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,633
She'll get over it.

632
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,910
Roger, Don, Harry and myself

633
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,659
should probably begin the process
of letting people go

634
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,366
to avoid any further damage to morale.

635
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,337
And please try and limit
any sympathetic adjustments to severance.

636
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:47,046
Yes, and as Lane mentioned, we'll try
to hold onto any Staplers, scissors,

637
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,718
hole punches and tape dispensers.

638
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,591
They do disappear.

639
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:55,057
Don, are you ever gonna call back
the American Cancer Society?

640
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,510
They've tried you twice this morning.

641
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:59,270
I saw that. it's a joke.

642
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,389
It's not. They finally called me.

643
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,476
They want us to come in and meet
about an anti-smoking campaign.

644
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:06,944
Really?

645
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,524
Took me about five minutes
to stop laughing. I hope I didn't blow it.

646
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,864
Well, that's interesting, right?

647
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,948
Great. Public service. Free work.

648
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,907
That's just what we should be doing
right now.

649
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,208
It's prestigious.

650
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,127
But we can't eat prestige.

651
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,797
Someone called us.
We could have new work on the air.

652
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,546
There's a lot of bigwigs on the board.

653
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,004
Under normal circumstances,
I would consider this an opportunity.

654
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,464
Absolutely.

655
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:38,097
Yes, Don saved the company.
Now go get rid of half of it.

656
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,433
We should probably stay in here.

657
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,892
I suppose.

658
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,604
Lane, may I speak with you a moment?

659
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:54,109
Well, I've gotta go learn a bunch
of people's names before I fire them.

660
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:04,039
I know you said the end of business today,
but that money, I don't have it.

661
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:10,167
Is there any way I can owe it
on advance against bonus or future salary?

662
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,128
Calm yourself. Don paid your share.

663
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,845
What?

664
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,467
Perhaps you weren't supposed to know that.

665
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,514
Well, thank you for the opportunity.

666
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,391
It was my pleasure.

667
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,199
Bill.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
