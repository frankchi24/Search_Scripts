1
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,384
Hello?

2
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,971
I still have to pack for a 7:00 a.m. flight,
thanks to you.

3
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,695
Will you at least put me out of my misery
before you go?

4
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,197
Stop it. American Cancer loved the letter,
and they're gonna love you.

5
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:12,123
And then you're gonna stop working,
take your Kids to California and have a ball.

6
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,952
I have this sick feeling
in the pit of my stomach.

7
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,136
Listen, maybe it's not all about work.

8
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,716
Maybe that sick feeling might go away

9
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,975
if you take your head out of the sand
about the past.

10
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,732
You know it's not that simple.

11
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,607
Of course it isn't,
and you don't have to do it alone.

12
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,239
But if you resolve some of that,

13
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,909
you might be more comfortable
with everything.

14
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,244
And then what happens?

15
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,746
And then you're stuck trying to be a person
like the rest of us.

16
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,178
I'll call you Tuesday when you get back.

17
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,353
I'm gonna miss you, you know.

18
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,960
-Any outgoing?
-Mail?

19
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,292
Just this.

20
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,548
Don't post it. it's for you.

21
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,720
It's been discussed among the partners
that you be promoted

22
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,348
to director of agency operations.

23
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,186
-My goodness.
-Now, it's a dreadful reality

24
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,564
that we've not signed any new business
in 10 weeks,

25
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:10,738
so I hope you'll understand
that this is a title only, for now.

26
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,199
Well, it's almost an honor.

27
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,038
What made you suddenly write that?

28
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,091
Well, most of it was in the letter, hopefully,

29
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,309
but I think, in my heart, it was an impulse,

30
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,978
because I knew what I needed to do
to move forward.

31
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,023
Well, it was a gesture
we hope will be useful.

32
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,230
We believe, obviously,
that lung cancer is avoidable

33
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,854
and can be thwarted
with the right campaign.

34
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,984
But how?

35
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,067
We know frightening medical facts
are useless.

36
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,279
-Half of us are smokers.
-I'm a smoker, too.

37
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,869
And you can forget about us.
I've worked $10 million campaigns

38
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,542
that can't even get people to change brands.

39
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,994
I can tell you from the inside
that the business

40
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,500
is really only about getting new smokers.

41
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,050
-Teenagers are a tough sell.
-Not to tobacco companies.

42
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,214
They play on a two-pronged attack,
promising adulthood and rebellion,

43
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:18,676
but teenagers are sentimental, as well.

44
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:20,890
Have you heard their music?

45
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:28,485
-I can tell you a little of what I have in mind.
-I have to say, it's very interesting.

46
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,982
Go on.

47
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,368
What I'm suggesting
is a series of commercials

48
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,491
that run during Bandstand and the like.

49
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,956
Show mothers and daughters
or fathers and sons,

50
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,661
and that cigarettes are between them.

51
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:50,591
And you show with a walk on the beach,
baking cookies, playing catch,

52
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,295
that the parents are not long for this world.

53
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,095
But they hate their parents.

54
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,766
They won't be thinking about their parents.
They'll be thinking about themselves.

55
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,935
That's what they do.

56
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,806
The truth is,

57
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:11,771
they're mourning for their childhood
more than they're anticipating their future,

58
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,572
because they don't know it yet,
but they don't want to die.

59
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,154
If it helps, I can guarantee you
that Lucky Strike will hate this.

60
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,041
-How'd it go?
-So, did you get Cancer?

61
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,839
Megan, can you get Mr. Cosgrove?

62
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:38,218
-We've got a meeting for another meeting.
-They were eating out of his hand.

63
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:46,017
And even better, the board was loaded
with fat cats, just like you said.

64
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,942
Don had a particularly empathic exchange
with the CEO of Dow Chemical.

65
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,065
Saran Wrap would be nice.

66
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,983
I'll take him out on the links,
let him beat me.

67
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,315
Roger, this is a philanthropic organization.

68
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,617
Don and I think it best
if we approach from the rear.

69
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,076
-Are we celebrating?
-Don got us to the top three.

70
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,415
-Stupendous.
-Ken, sit down.

71
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,755
Everett Marlowe at Dow
is a very charming fellow.

72
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,928
Your father-in-law to be is at Corning, right?
They must be quite acquainted.

73
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,012
-I think that's likely.
-Well, I was thinking,

74
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,017
wouldn't it be fun
to have a foursome this weekend

75
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,475
that includes your father-in-law,
yourself and Mr. Marlowe?

76
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,856
Doesn't that sound like fun?

77
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,907
-I don't know.
-Ken, there's no reason to be suddenly shy.

78
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,746
I'm sure if you impressed Everett
this morning,

79
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,448
that should be enough
to get him on the phone.

80
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,283
Well, I just looked him in the eye
and convinced him

81
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,917
I was some kind of idealistic businessman.
How is it gonna look if I call for a meeting?

82
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,711
Pretty bad, I guess.

83
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,714
But I'm not Pete.

84
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,763
-Sorry about that.
-No, you're obviously not.

85
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,720
Tom Vogel is our biggest client,
unless we sign Dow, which would be yours.

86
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,850
Look, I love Cynthia's dad,

87
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,770
and I know that every account I have
will eventually leave me.

88
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,898
-That's awfully pessimistic.
-Well, it's not worth the risk.

89
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,480
Cynthia's my life. My actual life.

90
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,409
Fine, if you want to tuck it
between your legs, I'll call him,

91
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,658
but I have to warn you,
I'm going to drop your name.

92
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,204
You do whatever you want.

93
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,877
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm going to go service the 30% of this firm

94
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,546
that are my clients.

95
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,174
Hello, Carla. Is Sally home?

96
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,308
-She is, but you shouldn't be here.
-Are they moving today?

97
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,729
Monday. That's the Salvation Army.

98
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,687
Mrs. Draper's car is gone.
I just wanted to say hi.

99
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,824
-I don't know.
-Fine. I just want to say bye.

100
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:08,697
She's upstairs. Don't be long.
Mrs. Francis just ran to the store.

101
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,623
Thank you.

102
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,204
-It's Glen. Are you decent?
-Come in.

103
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,252
You really shouldn't be here.

104
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,384
So, you're finally moving.

105
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,551
This weekend while we're in California
with my dad.

106
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,393
-Jeez, is that where you're moving?
-No, we're moving to Rye.

107
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,773
I'll be able to drive in a few years.

108
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,446
-I can come visit.
-Really?

109
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,861
Absolutely.

110
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,371
I can send you postcards.
I have your address.

111
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,038
It's not that big a deal.
I say goodbye to people all the time.

112
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,261
Okay. Are you going to Disneyland?

113
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,010
-Yes.
-Get me something.

114
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:23,651
-What are you doing here?
-I'm sorry. it's my fault.

115
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,732
Get out.

116
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,534
-What are you waiting for?
-Why do you hate me?

117
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,659
You don't think I know what you're doing?
You could be friends with anyone.

118
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,658
Just 'cause you're sad
doesn't mean everybody has to be.

119
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,708
I'm sorry. I didn't see the harm.
He wanted to say goodbye.

120
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,136
-Did you leave them alone?
-They're friends, that's all.

121
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,305
When did you decide
that you're her mother?

122
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,718
It was a mistake.
There's no need for that kind of talk.

123
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,351
You know what, Carla?

124
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,479
I've been thinking, and the distance is...

125
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:06,194
I need someone new nearby,
someone closer to the new house.

126
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,276
This should square us for the week.

127
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:15,158
Do you think I enjoy doing this?
After all these years? I won't have it, Carla.

128
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,411
Well, someone has
to look after those children.

129
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,589
Really? And where are your kids?

130
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,918
-Are they all doctors and lawyers?
-You'd best stop talking now.

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,096
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to say goodbye to the children.

132
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:34,096
Do you think that's a good idea right now?
It'll just upset them more.

133
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,768
Some other time.

134
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:48,323
The bungalow in San Pedro
netted you 10 grand in profit.

135
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:49,945
What's happening with the other house?

136
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,948
I have a listing appointment with the realtor
when I get back from California,

137
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,200
-but I have no idea what it's worth.
-it's Ossining,

138
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,907
but I say you'll more
than double your money,

139
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,664
which is not bad for 10 years.

140
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,961
What about the loss
for what I put into the company?

141
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:06,291
That's an investment. it's not a loss.
Don't be impatient.

142
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,550
Enjoy the harvest. Plant some seeds.
Maybe get a place of your own.

143
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,386
Don't you want to go home someday
and see a steak on the table?

144
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,768
So, Mary Sunshine,
what's the capital gains? 48%?

145
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,770
-Mrs. Francis is on the phone. It's urgent.
-You want me to go?

146
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,605
It's always urgent.

147
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,281
-Hello?
-I'm very sorry,

148
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,951
and I know this will disrupt your plans,
but I'm afraid I had to let Carla go today.

149
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,998
-What? What happened?
-Don, I have the children 99% of the time.

150
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,824
This is a decision that I get to make.

151
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:45,460
-Well, can't I just hire her back for the trip?
-No! I don't want her poisoning the well.

152
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,790
I told the kids she's sick.

153
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,671
So what the hell do I do, Betty,
with no help?

154
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,505
I have meetings, two flights,
diapers, for Christ's sake.

155
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,433
-Then don't take them! They're used to it.
-We're going!

156
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,865
Hey, Pumpernickel.
There's nobody out front.

157
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,787
-I already ate.
-Me too,

158
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:22,242
and I ran into someone I'd like you to meet.
This is Carolyn Jones, like Morticia.

159
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,919
Peggy Olson, advertising wunderkind

160
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,543
-Pleased to meet you.
-Do you mind?

161
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,003
Carolyn was at a photo shoot
modeling pantyhose, of all things,

162
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,306
and she got fired and she has to make rent.

163
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:40,306
Joyce witnessed my nervous breakdown
at Howard Johnson's today.

164
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,938
Well, hello, ladies.

165
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,482
Peggy, I needed to talk to you
about my ABC meeting,

166
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:50,232
but if I'm interrupting...
Who is this lovely young thing?

167
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,235
Harry, this is my friend Joyce.
I thought you'd already met.

168
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,075
Harold Crane, head of media.

169
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,528
-Carolyn Jones.
-No kidding.

170
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,661
-She's looking for work.
-That's hard to believe.

171
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,919
As an actress, model?
What is your experience like?

172
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:10,590
Well, I've been modeling,
at least until this morning.

173
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,088
The Topaz people went nuts,
fired the people who hired me,

174
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,420
-and then me.
-But you didn't do anything wrong, did you?

175
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,178
No, she didn't.
Peggy, do you think you can help?

176
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:23,012
Maybe. I'm sorry.
You said Topaz fired everyone?

177
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,394
-They were very brusque.
-People lose their heads.

178
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,474
I'm sure it was a mistake, dear.

179
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,608
-We should be going, honey.
-Yes. Yes, of course.

180
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,485
Pleased to meet you.

181
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,317
We'll see what we can do, Carolyn Jones.

182
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,960
-Any luck?
-The hotel has a service,

183
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,296
but the girls who can take care
of Sally and Bobby

184
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,925
won't watch a two-year-old and vice versa,

185
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,885
so I've arranged for two girls
to cover the two mornings you're working.

186
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,844
I thought you might need someone
for Disneyland,

187
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,477
and maybe handle the Dodger game
on your own.

188
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,730
-Does that sound like a vacation?
-Maybe it'll be an adventure.

189
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,983
How much do you make a week?

190
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,945
-$70.
-What if I were to double that?

191
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:24,497
I'll give you some nights free,
and you'll get to go to California.

192
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,540
Swimming pools, movie stars.

193
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,036
I don't really have
any professional experience.

194
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,463
You'll be great. Sally loved you,
and Bobby likes a pretty face,

195
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,792
and the baby... He's tough, but he's fun.

196
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,424
I've never been to California.

197
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,506
I have a college friend
who's been begging me to visit.

198
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,846
Perfect. Call her up, pick a night,
I'll foot the bill. What do you have to lose?

199
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,016
Please, stop the advertising.

200
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,568
Come on. Let's go to the room first.

201
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,445
Let's go,
or we're gonna go back to the parking lot

202
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,197
and spend the weekend locked in the car.

203
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:13,413
Art Garten, real name. At Topaz Pantyhose?
Called me back.

204
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,090
He was shocked and impressed
that I'd heard about them firing Dupre.

205
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,042
It gets better.
They already bought placement

206
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,548
for the campaign that just fell apart,

207
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,221
and we've been invited in Monday
to pick up the pieces.

208
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,799
-I just told you that.
-Monday's a holiday.

209
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,011
They're out of time. All we have to do
is not throw up on our shoes.

210
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,347
-Do you want help?
-She's not gonna be there.

211
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,143
Good work.

212
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,482
Okay, okay, here he is.

213
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,712
-That was great.
-it's how we got Gene to sleep.

214
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,922
Well, let's not wake him up.

215
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:11,604
They played in the pool for four hours
and bounced on the bed for another two.

216
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,307
I think everybody's gonna sleep very well.

217
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,939
I need you to come over at 7:00 tomorrow
to watch Gene.

218
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,611
I'll get these two breakfast on the road.

219
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,938
Okay.

220
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,066
-Good night.
-Good night.

221
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,698
You said you didn't have any experience,
and you're like Maria von Trapp.

222
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,537
Professionally, but I have four nieces
and six nephews.

223
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:50,223
-So, how was your meeting?
-Pick me up and move me to my bed.

224
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,061
Well, hello, there.

225
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,946
Stephanie, this is Sally and Bobby.

226
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,989
-Hello.
-Hi.

227
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:08,616
Well, it's very nice to meet you.
How do you like California?

228
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,823
They love it.

229
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,080
The notary was supposed to be here
at 10:00, but she's late.

230
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,955
My mom put the papers in order,
so all you have to do is sign,

231
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,086
and then you can go to Marineland.

232
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,926
Who painted on the wall?

233
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,927
My friend Anna. She used to live here.
Stephanie is her niece.

234
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,427
Who's Dick?

235
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,028
That's me.

236
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,449
That's my nickname sometimes.

237
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,620
Go out back and get us some lemons.

238
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,164
They're adorable.

239
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,925
Is this it?

240
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,880
My friend Charlie is gonna help me
move the piano back to my mom's,

241
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:12,388
and the rest of it goes to St. Vincent de Paul.

242
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,594
Four boxes. Good for her.

243
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,935
She wanted you to have something.

244
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,231
It's her engagement ring from Don.

245
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,742
-Don't you want it?
-She wanted you to have it.

246
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:34,323
You shouldn't play around with that.
Besides, I don't believe in it.

247
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,915
-So, are you going back to school?
-Not for the moment.

248
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,338
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

249
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,264
That's the best part, right?
Got the rest of my life ahead of me.

250
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,556
So do you.

251
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,434
That's her.

252
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,369
Who's that?

253
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,792
-How was it?
-Most of it was fun.

254
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,791
-Daddy, are you coming in?
-I'm not wearing my bathing suit.

255
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,122
Come in. You have to come in.

256
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,084
-I'm gonna be a shark.
-Come on, Daddy.

257
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,178
You swim all the time in New York.

258
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:34,724
I'm really beat.

259
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,953
Should I throw some herring to you two?

260
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,470
Dumbo, Mad Tea Party.

261
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,353
-And Mr. Toad.
-Gene can't go on Mr. Toad.

262
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,067
I'll get it.

263
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,146
He can stay with Megan
while we go on the ride.

264
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,105
Then Megan can't go.

265
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,109
Hi, Sally.

266
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,787
This is my friend Camille.

267
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:41,537
Camille, this is Don and Gene
and Bobby and Sally.

268
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,117
Hello, everybody.

269
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,544
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't need anything else.

270
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,246
No, I think we're okay.

271
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,875
-Where are you going?
-The Whisky a Go Go.

272
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,634
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night. Have fun.

273
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,106
What about Tomorrowland?
I don't want to ride an elephant.

274
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,526
I want to fly a jet.

275
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,561
Hello?

276
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,397
-Henry?
-I'm in here.

277
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,406
I'm sorry. Everyone was late

278
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:21,205
and then it took three of them
to light the pilot on the water heater.

279
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,157
Carla called looking for you.

280
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,420
-What did she want?
-You know what she wanted.

281
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,294
You fired her and didn't tell me?

282
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,214
Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't want her invoking your sympathies.

283
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,139
-Why did you fire her?
-Because I don't trust her judgment-

284
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,340
What did she say?

285
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,677
She said you wouldn't give her
a letter of recommendation.

286
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,264
How long did the woman work for you?
I know she doesn't steal. What did she do?

287
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,475
And don't tell me
it's just about the neighbor boy.

288
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,275
Sally is not allowed to see him.

289
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,730
-Carla said he's her friend.
-"Carla said." "Carla said"?

290
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,781
I don't understand what you're doing.

291
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,450
You didn't want to move because
you wanted the kids to have some stability,

292
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,995
and then you get rid of their nanny
since they were born?

293
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,913
I wanted a fresh start, okay?

294
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,494
-I'm entitled to that.
-There is no fresh start! Lives carry on!

295
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,005
Jesus, Henry,
just once could you take my side?

296
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,378
No one's ever on your side, Betty.

297
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,782
Just a minute.

298
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,172
Am I bothering you?

299
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:58,344
No, I was out on the balcony
enjoying the view.

300
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:04,426
I heard you come in and I wanted to go over
the plan for tomorrow for Disneyland.

301
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,264
Do you think I should be involved
in such high-level decisions?

302
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,818
I can't turn on the TV. They're asleep.

303
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,619
There's nothing on TV.
Come outside with me.

304
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,621
It's so beautiful here.

305
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:36,712
-Did you have fun with your friend?
-Not really. She's not really my friend.

306
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,296
We just lived together during college.
My father's a professor.

307
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,640
I think she liked him too much.

308
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,562
So, why did you see her?

309
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,318
I don't know.

310
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,985
She's an actress now.
She's in two episodes of Hogan's Heroes.

311
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,247
She told me I could never do it
because of my teeth.

312
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,495
She actually said that to me.

313
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,666
I don't even want to be an actress.

314
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,338
I love your teeth.

315
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,880
I took elocution lessons
when I moved to New York.

316
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,466
The teacher said I had the mouth of a singer.

317
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:47,029
-Are you sure we should do this?
-I've been thinking about you so much.

318
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,416
Were you thinking about this
when I asked you to come?

319
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,460
It was the first thought
that went through my head.

320
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,306
I was gonna miss you so much, anyway.

321
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:54,012
-You don't know anything about me.
-But I do.

322
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,766
I know that you have a good heart,

323
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,648
and I know that you're always trying
to be better.

324
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,865
We all try. We don't always make it.

325
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,123
I've done a lot of things.

326
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:20,295
I know who you are now.

327
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:33,305
-It's getting light outside.
-I should get back before the sun comes up.

328
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,143
They're little roosters.

329
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,734
You should go.
I don't want to confuse them.

330
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,751
I want to know if I can knock on this door
again tomorrow night,

331
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:03,707
or if this is just what it is,
like that night in the office.

332
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:10,054
-I need to know. I don't know why.
-Because you're afraid?

333
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,225
You shouldn't be.

334
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,187
Disneyland fireworks are at 9:00.

335
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:30,112
How about dinner tomorrow night
at 11:00 right here?

336
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,411
We're gonna be together all day.

337
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,800
This is Art. Art, Ken Cosgrove and Patricia...

338
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,302
-What was it?
-Peggy Olson.

339
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:57,806
Sit. I'd offer you coffee,
but everybody's gone for the holiday.

340
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,138
The perils of being in charge.

341
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,308
So, you can tell we don't have a lot of time.

342
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,270
I mean, not just today.
We're in kind of a bind.

343
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,899
We're no worse than we were before,

344
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,607
-and I hated those people.
-Do you have the old work?

345
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,240
Somewhere. Look, it was a gorgeous girl.

346
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:20,701
High heels, jewelry, pulling up
this Cinderella gown to show the Topaz,

347
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,535
but she wasn't Cinderella,
and where the hell was she going?

348
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,132
We want something that'll stand out.
I don't care if it's a cartoon.

349
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,426
I don't care if it's Abe Beame wearing them.

350
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,299
We're a tiny company.
We need to make a stink.

351
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,422
Well, I've worn them,

352
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,930
but what qualities, in your mind,
do they have that make them unique?

353
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,928
You're wearing them right now?

354
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:45,482
Yes. Because I can wear Topaz Pantyhose
with anything.

355
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,230
I'm wearing them at work right now,

356
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,188
and I'll change everything but my hose
before I go out tonight.

357
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,069
One pair. That's all you need with Topaz.

358
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,285
If we only sold each girl one pair,
we'd be out of business.

359
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,246
"Topaz. The only pair of pantyhose
you'll ever need.

360
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:05,544
“Bad for business. Good for you."

361
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,292
That's very funny,

362
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:12,718
'cause it says our product's so good,
we're not even interested in ourselves.

363
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:18,425
-Okay, that's one. What else you got?
-Well, I'd have to think more,

364
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,227
but it might be great
to show a bunch of different outfits.

365
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:26,307
One for formal, one for business,
one a little sporty,

366
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,321
and something like
"Single pair, singular comfort."

367
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,817
-it's got the word "single" in it.
-That's two.

368
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,639
Daddy, tell Sally
that snakes used to have legs.

369
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,763
-I don't know if that's true.
-You know, it's true in the Bible.

370
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,344
We learned that they used to be fish,

371
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,600
and he doesn't know
because he has baby science.

372
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,352
They found a skeleton.

373
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,934
Where? You don't know.
You're a short stuff.

374
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,143
Okay, Thally.

375
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,354
-Shut up!
-Great!

376
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,153
Don't be upset. it's just a milkshake.

377
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,863
Can you grab a straw or some napkins?
This is my last dress.

378
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,556
I'm sorry. Is it late?

379
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,431
I wanted to let you sleep.

380
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:53,898
-How long have you been up?
-A few hours.

381
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,570
What's wrong?

382
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,525
I couldn't sleep.

383
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,241
I just kept thinking about you.

384
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,076
I'm right here.

385
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,750
I don't know what it is about you,

386
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,468
but I feel like myself when I'm with you,

387
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,548
but the way I always wanted to feel.

388
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:30,602
Because I'm in love with you, Megan,
and I think I have been for a while.

389
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,442
Don.

390
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,607
Oh, my goodness.

391
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,118
Open it.

392
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,917
It's beautiful.

393
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,043
When I saw you sleeping there, I thought...

394
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,628
I couldn't imagine
not seeing you there every morning.

395
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,266
Will you marry me?

396
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:15,393
I don't know what to say. This is all so fast.

397
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,276
Did you ever think of the number of things
that had to happen

398
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,152
for me to get to know you?

399
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,653
But everything happened,

400
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,707
and it got me here. What does that mean?

401
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,087
I can't believe this.

402
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,164
Yes ! Yes !

403
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:52,350
You have a ring? How long
have you been thinking about this?

404
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,431
It's been in my family...

405
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,144
Not my family, really.

406
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:04,279
It belonged to someone
very important to me.

407
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:08,282
I don't believe this. I have to call my mother.

408
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,955
I had this feeling,
and I called her from California

409
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,534
-because I wanted it to go away.
-I saw it on the bill.

410
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:17,793
Sorry. I have to call her.
Do you want me to call her from work?

411
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,465
No, call her.

412
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:24,928
-What about work? What do we do?
-We tell everybody.

413
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,048
Okay.

414
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,351
Do you want me to leave you alone?

415
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,809
-Do you want me to talk to her?
-Do you speak French?

416
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,212
-What the hell's going on?
-I don't know. He wouldn't say.

417
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,085
Look at you, brown as a berry.

418
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:05,089
-How was the coast?
-Wonderful. Joan, could you shut the door?

419
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,679
I have an announcement to make,

420
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,682
and it shouldn't change anything here,
except for me, and maybe for Joan,

421
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,937
but Miss Calvet and I are getting married.

422
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,606
-Who the hell's that?
-Megan.

423
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,942
Really?

424
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:32,075
Congratulations, Don.
I wish you the best of luck.

425
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,077
Megan out there?

426
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:39,036
Yeah, I know it's a surprise,
but she makes me very happy,

427
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,709
and, well,
it's something we both want very much.

428
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,968
Well, let's get her in here.

429
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,801
Megan.

430
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,888
-How exciting for you.
-I know. I can't believe it.

431
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,518
Congratulations, dear.

432
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:04,195
You don't say "congratulations"
to the bride. You say "best wishes."

433
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,270
Congratulations, Don.

434
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,107
Let's have a toast.
Megan, could you get us some ice?

435
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:13,032
I'm teasing. See, Don?
This is the way to behave.

436
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:19,410
-So, when are you getting married?
-I don't know. We haven't discussed it.

437
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,494
Soon.

438
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:26,375
-Art Garten just called.
-No. What did he say?

439
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:30,088
He said he liked ideas two and four,
and we've got a week.

440
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,722
-Shall we go rub it in?
-After you.

441
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,178
You did it.

442
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:46,361
-We've got some great news.
-Are you two getting married?

443
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:53,364
-What's going on?
-They're getting married.

444
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,286
-Really?
-Congratulations!

445
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,787
-Thank you.
-it's incredible.

446
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:05,214
-I know. It just happened.
-That's incredible. You must be so happy.

447
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:11,754
I'll get it.

448
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:19,311
-We have some news, too. Peg.
-Yes! We signed an account.

449
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:22,356
Topaz Pantyhose.
It's a quarter of a million dollars.

450
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,478
-How'd you do that?
-Peggy found out about them,

451
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,275
and then we met over the holiday.

452
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:31,403
That's great news! We broke the streak!
What a great day! Good work, both of you!

453
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,700
So anyway,
I guess we should tell everybody.

454
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:37,074
-Topaz needs work this week.
-Great.

455
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,576
I hope you have all the happiness
that Peggy and I had signing this account.

456
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,707
I'll be there in a minute.

457
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,135
Wow.

458
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:58,092
It's been going on a while,
but I appreciate your concern.

459
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,430
Well, then I'm happy for you. Both of you.

460
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,651
She's very beautiful.

461
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:13,107
You know, she reminds me of you.
She's got the same spark.

462
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,952
I know she admires you
just as much as I do.

463
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,382
It was Dr. Miller again.

464
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,391
It's not gonna get any easier
the longer you wait.

465
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,649
Whatever could be on your mind?

466
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:56,742
-Can you believe it?
-It happens all the time.

467
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,238
They're all just between marriages.
You know that.

468
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,449
He'll probably make her a copywriter.

469
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,125
He's not going to want to be married
to his secretary.

470
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:09,205
Really? Is that what he meant?

471
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,174
"She admires you"? Jesus.

472
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,470
That's the way it works for some.

473
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,762
You know, I just saved this company.

474
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,765
I signed the first new business
since Lucky Strike left,

475
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:28,314
but it's not as important
as getting married. Again.

476
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:32,610
Well, I was just made
director of agency operations.

477
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,063
A title. No money, of course.

478
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,525
And if they poured champagne, it must've
been while I was pushing the mail cart.

479
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,241
A pretty face comes along,
and everything goes out the window.

480
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:47,576
Well, I learned a long time ago
to not get all my satisfaction from this job.

481
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,874
That's bullshit.

482
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,023
-Faye Miller.
-Hi, it's me.

483
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,068
I was starting to worry
you were ill or something.

484
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,403
-I need to talk to you.
-Well, I was gonna come by at lunch anyway.

485
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:22,907
No, you shouldn't do that.
Why don't we meet somewhere?

486
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,030
What is going on?

487
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:31,874
Something happened, and I'd like
to talk to you about it face to face.

488
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,752
-Meet me for coffee.
-Okay.

489
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,006
You know what?

490
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:44,842
I'm not gonna have some conversation
and have to sit through coffee afterwards.

491
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,551
Just get to it.

492
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,271
Well,

493
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,527
H

494
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,863
met somebody.

495
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,200
-And we're engaged.
-Are you kidding me?

496
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,288
I know, I know. it's a surprise.
It was for me too.

497
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,248
Jesus.

498
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,747
Who is she?

499
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,551
What's the difference? I fell in love.

500
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:27,468
I didn't mean for this to happen.
You've been very important to me.

501
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,888
So you're not gonna put an ad
in the New York Times

502
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,268
saying you never liked me?

503
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,898
-Faye.
-Well, I hope you're very happy,

504
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,071
and I hope she knows
you only like the beginnings of things.

505
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:42,991
I'm sorry.

506
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,237
-I don't know what else to say.
-Goodbye.

507
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,545
I saw the light go off.

508
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,181
It's fine. It's done.

509
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,025
I love you, you know.

510
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,452
And he's smiling like a fool,

511
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,126
like he's the first man
that ever married his secretary.

512
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,795
She's 25. As if that's news.

513
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,872
So, when are you gonna
tell them your news?

514
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,799
They'll know soon enough.

515
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,174
Are you showing at all?
The picture I have of you doesn't change.

516
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:50,468
-I'll take a new one and I'll send it to you.
-You know all I want to know.

517
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,804
Yes, honey, they're bigger.

518
00:41:54,554 --> 00:42:00,607
Why are you torturing me? I just woke up
and it's already 90 degrees here.

519
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,232
Listen, I've gotta go.

520
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,818
-Not yet.
-What?

521
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,071
-Not yet!
-You listen to the doctor.

522
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,199
You have to eat.
Don't worry about your figure.

523
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,576
I'll whip you and the baby into shape
when I get back.

524
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:14,286
Okay.

525
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,623
I'll call you Thursday night, your time.

526
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:21,707
-Okay. I love you.
-I love you, too.

527
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,110
Hello?

528
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,488
-Mrs. Truxton?
-No, it's me.

529
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,834
-What are you doing here?
-it's Tuesday at 7:00.

530
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,036
I thought I told you
I had a listing appointment

531
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,541
with the real estate agent.

532
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:09,255
I didn't realize that was today.
I forgot about the cabinets in the guest bath.

533
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:12,929
-So you weren't that thorough?
-I guess not.

534
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:44,585
-Do you like the new house?
-I do. it's got a lot of character.

535
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,922
I'll probably have to tear out the kitchen.

536
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,844
Remember this place?

537
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,559
I do.

538
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:03,608
-it's different. That's for certain.
-isn't that what you wanted?

539
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,525
I don't know, Don.

540
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,285
Things aren't perfect.

541
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,198
So you'll move again.

542
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,956
So much change. it's made everything

543
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,885
difficult.

544
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,889
I have to tell you something.

545
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,689
I met someone.

546
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,732
I'm engaged.

547
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,863
Really?

548
00:44:56,194 --> 00:45:00,574
-Bethany Van Nuys?
-No. Someone at work.

549
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,511
I'm very happy for you.

550
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,719
It's okay, Betty.

551
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,275
I don't know why I'm surprised.

552
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,110
Is she your secretary?
I know she watched the kids in California.

553
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,573
Yes.

554
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,240
So, I will see you the weekend after next.

555
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,872
-What is that, the 23rd?
-I think so.

556
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,295
Wait.

557
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,094
Congratulations.

558
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,929
Thank you.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
