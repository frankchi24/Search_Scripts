1
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,467
"Greyhound.
The cure for the common bus."

2
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,588
"La-Z-Boy. The cure for the common chair."

3
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,016
"Budweiser.
The cure for the common beer."

4
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,436
"Manufacturers Hanover Bank.

5
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,022
"The cure for the common bank."

6
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,269
How about, "Alka-Seltzer.
The cure for the common cold"?

7
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,699
"The cure for the common cold"
is the idiom I'm playing off.

8
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,201
It's an idiom. Did you know that?

9
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,493
So other than your summer internship
at Needham,

10
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,496
do you have any actual
advertising experience?

11
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:18,128
"The cure for the common chair,"
that's Roger's favorite.

12
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,164
Roger Sterling.

13
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,217
He's the guy I shook hands with
when I came in.

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,627
What did Roger think of this ad?

15
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,963
What, are you kidding me?
Everybody loves that.

16
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,846
It's the opposite of what you expect.
That's what I'm interested in.

17
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,719
Why is it in your book?

18
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,935
I've got a bunch of them in there.
Marlboro Man, Maidenform.

19
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,642
I like to put in work that I admire.

20
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,644
Don't you ever tear things
out of magazines?

21
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,155
Yes, but I don't put them in my book.

22
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,534
Well, you know what they say,

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,115
"Aspiration's as good as perspiration."

24
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,322
That's not how it goes.

25
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:59,124
Look, I'm a 24-year-old kid.

26
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,464
I want to be in the ad game.

27
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,085
I know I've got a lot to learn,
but I'm a hard worker.

28
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,795
I'd sweep up the floors around here.

29
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,348
I don't know if Roger told you that.
He did talk to you, didn't he?

30
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,216
He did.

31
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,854
It was really a pleasure to meet you, Danny.

32
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,778
-I wish you the best of luck.
-Best of luck in what?

33
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,863
-What do you mean?
-You trailed off.

34
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,239
We'll let you know.

35
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:30,408
Do you know a good place
to eat around here?

36
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,701
Tell my secretary you're hungry
and see what she suggests.

37
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,958
I don't work for you.

38
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,043
Are we on Candid Camera?

39
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,137
I don't want to jump on his grave
or anything,

40
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,308
but there's no way he's 24. I'm 25.

41
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,312
What's his connection to Roger?

42
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,390
Besides being delusional?

43
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,525
He's Jane Siegel's cousin.

44
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:10,074
It's a relief to see someone
worse than me and really know it.

45
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,318
Don't get used to it.

46
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:17,786
Well, you know, I look at Glo-Coat
and see how far everything's come.

47
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,034
You know, my work.

48
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,494
Glo-Coat.

49
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,792
You finish something,
you find out everyone loves it

50
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,045
right around the time that
it feels like someone else did it.

51
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,387
Is that your speech for the CLIOs?

52
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,884
They don't have speeches.

53
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,049
We're going to win.

54
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,555
Just because I got nominated

55
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,227
doesn't mean they're going to give me
an award.

56
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,523
-Aren't you excited?
-I try not to think about it.

57
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,599
Then you must be excited.

58
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,024
Well, it'd be good for the agency.

59
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:52,324
Grey doubled their value in five years
and it was all based on awards.

60
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,484
You got anything on Vicks?

61
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,950
-Actually, it's Vick Chemical.
-Answer the question.

62
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,241
We're very behind.

63
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,209
Your new art director
has been waiting for synchronicity,

64
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,667
which involves me coming up
with a bunch of ideas,

65
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,257
chasing him down and having him
draw all of them and lose them.

66
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,298
He's your new art director, too,
and you have a deadline.

67
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,846
And don't think you can spend Monday
hiding behind corners

68
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,050
and trying not to make eye contact.
I will find you.

69
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,930
I'm not the problem.

70
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,015
You are, because Stan is talented
and more experienced.

71
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:27,567
You need to learn how to work with him,
not the other way around.

72
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,653
Well, good luck this afternoon.

73
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,450
You're not supposed to say that.

74
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,448
Well, break a leg.

75
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,200
Charlie Chaplin was very lonely.

76
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,786
That Tramp, too much of a sad sack.

77
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:50,132
Laurel and Hardy, they were better,
except Hardy was so mean to Laurel.

78
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,208
I hated that.

79
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,921
Why am I talking about silent movies?

80
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:59,850
I suppose as part of the chapter
on your childhood?

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,018
That part of my book
is getting bigger and bigger.

82
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,310
Why is that?

83
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,852
Who is it?

84
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,609
I thought I should come in
and tell you this in person.

85
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,607
That kid, a very, very cute prank.

86
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,901
Caroline, to be continued.

87
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,820
That's a good idea.

88
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,028
I've been to the CLIOs before.
We're gonna want to show up prepared.

89
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,532
His book,

90
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,540
it was filled with old ads.

91
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,710
Plagiarism, that's resourceful.

92
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,956
He had five originals,
they were all the same thing.

93
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,501
I told him to be himself.
That was pretty mean, I guess.

94
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,759
-So when does he start?
-The first of never.

95
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,679
Well, you haven't been married for a while,

96
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,893
so you've probably
forgotten how these transactions work.

97
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,437
If I don't hire Jane's cousin,

98
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,810
it's probably going to cost me
a personal gift expenditure

99
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,891
of between $500 and $1,000.

100
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,606
-When are we leaving?
-Right after Life Cereal.

101
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,155
To new business.

102
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,737
And victory at the Waldorf.

103
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,942
I mean it. You deserve it.

104
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,697
So, I can show you what's popular,
what's unique,

105
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,578
and the only thing I ask
is that you call me Don.

106
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,207
Well, Don, I can't say
I know my furs that well.

107
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,629
I know my mother had a Chinchilla,

108
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,966
I was always on the verge
of a romantic relationship with it.

109
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,168
-Is this for your mother?
-I bet you never hear that.

110
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,801
I don't. Would you like
to give me a price range?

111
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,841
That's an interesting question.
I have a unique problem.

112
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,768
I need to spend a lot,
but be careful not to spend too much.

113
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,555
Not a unique problem.
And I don't want to be forward,

114
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,766
but can I assume this is
some kind of an apology?

115
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,355
No, no, no, I know exactly
how much that costs.

116
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,188
This is, "I'm getting to know you,
but I don't want to scare you."

117
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,731
I know what we're gonna do.

118
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,942
So now it's "we"?

119
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,036
It's always the right size
and nothing says mink like mink.

120
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,493
It's a nice way to ease into things,

121
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,203
and you can always come back
for the rest of it.

122
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,747
How about we split the difference
so they wear them to their waist?

123
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,127
It's the most popular this year.

124
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,559
That's a dumb question.
Who does your work?

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,143
-I do.
-Really?

126
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,931
Yeah. It's an interest of mine
and they let me do it.

127
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,319
Look at that. Can I give you a call?

128
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,483
First of all, you need 20 of those.
And second of all, no.

129
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,739
I just want you to call that number
so I can give you

130
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,320
some very specific delivery instructions.

131
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,327
Of course, Mr. Sterling.

132
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,660
So what do I owe you?

133
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,663
I saw you leave the office
with something under your arm.

134
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,046
You don't know what it is.

135
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,172
The guy in the elevator
thought it was a hydrogen bomb.

136
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,138
It's a beautiful box.

137
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,841
Skip the radio play. Open it.

138
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,725
Roger, you shouldn't have.

139
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,900
-You like it?
-I don't know what to say.

140
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,731
Try it on.

141
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,363
But first, take off the dress.

142
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,577
One gift at a time.

143
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,495
What is this, an owner's manual?

144
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,297
It's Noah's Ark.

145
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,926
It's out of line is what it is.

146
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:25,714
So?

147
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,969
I love it. it's perfect.

148
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,397
And I think it's a bit much.

149
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,184
If you don't kiss me after that,
I'm gonna believe you.

150
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:50,413
When I Wear it, I'll think of everything
that happened the night I got it.

151
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,378
Caroline! Get in here.
I think I finally have a work story.

152
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,641
Joan! What's keeping them?

153
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,597
Life.

154
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,893
When do you have to leave for the CLIOs?

155
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,269
I was late for the Emmys last year.

156
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,355
Red Skelton gave my seat away.

157
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,687
I'll surmise,
due to the usual nature of your stories,

158
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,443
that that's someone of note.

159
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,784
The good news is our friends
at the cereal company

160
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,327
have been grounded in Philly due to wind.

161
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,741
What's good about that?

162
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,906
And the bad news is

163
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,035
we only have an hour
before we're due at the CLIOs.

164
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,168
Sorry, kids.
Game called on account of wind.

165
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,916
If it's all about a send-off, I'll have a 7&7.

166
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,878
You have legs. Don?

167
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,137
Make it simple, but significant.

168
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,132
It's Friday.

169
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,388
For all we know, they're going to
turn around and go home

170
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,265
and we'll have to reschedule.

171
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,062
Is Joan going with you?

172
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,481
Yes. We only had four tickets.

173
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,687
There'll be a lot of
other people's clients there.

174
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,483
-Thank you, Joan.
-Peggy, anything?

175
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,819
I have work to do.

176
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,079
”We represent the majority
of the people in Alabama

177
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,407
"who hate niggerism, Catholicism,

178
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,084
”Judaism and all the 'isms'
in the whole world.”

179
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,246
So said Robert Creel
of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.

180
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,876
Somebody got it to Goldwater.

181
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,666
Apparently he pissed blood.

182
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,046
”...he needs our help. "

183
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,056
This again? Really?

184
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,096
Clara asked.

185
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,554
Clara asked to see your reel?

186
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,356
I just wanted to see that Klan one.
He said it never aired.

187
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,728
Which makes it less impressive, Clara.
Girls, do you mind?

188
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,043
Well, all the girls are gone.
What do you want?

189
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,295
Are you going to use the KKK
to sell cough drops?

190
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,713
It's better than waiting on you

191
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,510
to bring me something
that'll get my juices flowing.

192
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,847
Should I get Megan back in here?
Maybe she's not repressed.

193
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,768
Why's it so hard for you to accept
that man's natural state is nude?

194
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,140
Because I'm civilized.

195
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,974
Because you're brainwashed
by society into thinking it's dirty.

196
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,809
You take away all this crap
and you'd see it's not.

197
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,691
It's natural and it's beautiful.

198
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,064
Have you been yelled at by Don yet?

199
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,200
-I'm not scared of him.
-So that's a "No."

200
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,323
He said Monday,
and I'm not working this weekend.

201
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,747
Okay, okay. Jesus. Are you on the rag?

202
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,417
It'll get done. Let's go.

203
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,666
Well, I'd say you're lucky
the Glo-Coat brass isn't here.

204
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,878
The minute you win they know the ad's arty,
and then you're out of business.

205
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,304
Turns out there's almost 50 awards.

206
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,599
Let's say 10 minutes apiece, that's...
Holy crap.

207
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,551
Roger, you remember Ned Elliot from K&E.

208
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,103
Of course. What are you in for?

209
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,727
New England Merchants Bank.
Best local under $2,000.

210
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,184
Stop bragging, will you?

211
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,774
Good luck, Don.

212
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,445
Well, well, if it isn't
Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm.

213
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,778
Leave any drinks for the rest of us?

214
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,284
Don Draper, Roger Sterling,
this is Major-General Frank Alvin.

215
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,205
Roger, have you had the pleasure
of meeting Ted Chaough?

216
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,254
Is that how you say it? C-H-A-O-U-G-H?

217
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,253
Hey, writers, how many extra vowels is that?

218
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,589
Let's head due south, General.

219
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,215
Boy, I hope this doesn't drag on
like last year.

220
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,342
Oh, wait. You weren't here.

221
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,352
General Rufus T. Bullshit.

222
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,229
I've met that guy before.

223
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,274
-In the war?
-No, in a commercial for Bay Rum.

224
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,102
Chao-guh-guh hired an actor
to impress someone.

225
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,153
Last time I saw the General,
he had a parrot on his shoulder.

226
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,484
That was not a business proposition.

227
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,740
You catch more flies with honey.

228
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,495
Great, actual flies.

229
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,373
Phillip, how are you?

230
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,789
-You remember Joan Harris.
-Nice to see you.

231
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,544
Mr. Cosgrove, nice to see you again.

232
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,383
I'm surprised he would bring you over here.

233
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,381
You know, we miss Birds Eye
more than we miss Kenny.

234
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,218
Well, that's why I wanted to say hello.

235
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,308
-I hear the old team's getting back together.
-What team?

236
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,436
Phil, that's not a sure thing.

237
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,777
Well, I'll say this about Geyer,
they don't have Don.

238
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,190
Take your seats, please.

239
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,027
Well, we should sit down. Good luck.

240
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,537
Judas priest. Are we merging with Geyer?

241
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,830
Talk to Lane.

242
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,834
Welcome to the Sixth Annual
American Television Commercials Awards.

243
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,463
We 're here to honor creative excellence
in advertising and design...

244
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,637
I just ran into Ken Cosgrove.

245
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,973
Don't talk to me right now.

246
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,096
And I do mean everything.

247
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,935
I don't know if it was that funny
but thank you.

248
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,647
I have to tell you
I am very impressed you got this gig.

249
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,776
Yes. Well, thank you for making it easier.

250
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,732
Wally, it's me.

251
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:25,165
You know, when I was coming up at Y&R,
you were very inspiring.

252
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,702
Raymond Rubicam said you were a genius.

253
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,287
It's great to see you.

254
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,413
I mean, actually alive and everything.

255
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,541
Get your hands off me.

256
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,257
What's with the French service?

257
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,262
God! I miss working with that guy.

258
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,262
I feel like I've already won.

259
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,179
Well, i'm afraid that'll be the limit
to the public speaking portion of our show.

260
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,187
And, gentlemen, let's pace ourselves.

261
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:58,107
In the first category, that of apparel,
the nominees are...

262
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,778
That's five.

263
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,622
If you really worked on
the Johnson campaign, why are you here?

264
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:10,373
Because nobody at DDB
even keeps track of who does what,

265
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,330
except the daisy ad. Big deal.

266
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,050
The Klan is probably
the best thing I'll be near my entire life.

267
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,804
Well, let me tell you,
I had a lot to do with Glo-Coat. A lot.

268
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,131
The idea, especially.

269
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,092
The kid?

270
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:30,263
Don put the whole cowboy thing on it.
I don't know if it was that revolutionary.

271
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,725
It was jarring, but more cute than I like.

272
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:38,651
I know I'm not supposed to go,
but when the nomination came in,

273
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,816
Don let everybody pat him on the back.

274
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,282
He didn't even look at me and I was...
I was right there.

275
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,699
And I was clapping and he thought
I was clapping for him.

276
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,160
Who claps for themselves?

277
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:58,254
Okay, I'm gonna riff for a few minutes

278
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:02,758
and just sort of speechatize
the whole Vicks experience.

279
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,256
Should I come back when you're through?

280
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,641
No, toots, grab a pencil.

281
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,307
Someone's gonna want to get it down
before it heads into the Stratosphere.

282
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,305
Why don't you write down my ideas?

283
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,935
Look, I read your brochure.

284
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,438
I have no interest
in the Temperance Movement.

285
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,272
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

286
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,697
This is Byrrh on the rocks.

287
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,113
Be the first on your block
to serve Byrrh on the rocks.

288
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,709
And now for best Cleansers,
waxes and polishes.

289
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,749
-This is us.
-Glass wax sprays

290
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,670
"Gobbles Up Dirt, "
Campbell Mithun of Minneapolis.

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,502
How do I look?

292
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,132
-Great.
-One Step Floor Care's

293
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,465
"Bus Stop, " BBDO.

294
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:51,721
Glo-Coat, "Billy the Kid, ”
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

295
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,145
And Pledge, "Runaway Chain "
Benton and Bowles.

296
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,061
And the winner is

297
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,613
Glo-Coat, "Billy the Kid, "

298
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,571
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

299
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,953
-Congratulations, Don.
-Thank you.

300
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,227
-Next up, competing in the category of..
-Let me see it.

301
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,147
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

302
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,024
-What's going on, dear?
-Well, I ran over

303
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,356
because the people from Life Cereal
rented a car

304
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,111
and now they're waiting at the office.

305
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,451
-Right now?
-We'll reschedule.

306
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,403
Maybe I can convince them
to stay for the week.

307
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,202
No, no. They want to see our presentation.

308
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,908
What do you say
we put a cherry on this thing?

309
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,210
-Aye aye, sir.
-Really?

310
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,708
So the Schusters move into
what used to be the Harrington house.

311
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,293
Meanwhile, Betty gets extremely jealous

312
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,879
when she sees Allison dancing
with Rodney at the after-party.

313
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,885
But then Michael asked
Betty to dance with him

314
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,466
and also dances with Claire

315
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,395
and that is all I can tell you about
the next few weeks of Peyton Place.

316
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,939
-How the heck do you know all this?
-They send me the scripts.

317
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,063
I need to see them. it's my job.

318
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,732
I can't believe Connie
goes through with their wedding.

319
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,688
It is a surprise. I agree.

320
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,662
What more do I need to say?

321
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,332
-it's heavy.
-Don, you remember...

322
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,375
Jim and Dennis, glad you could make it.

323
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,083
I can't thank you enough for waiting.

324
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:45,668
Don't think about it. We've been unwinding
as Mr. Crane ruins Peyton Place for us.

325
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,760
Perfect. Let's get to it.

326
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:53,341
-Roger, thank you.
-I'll be on my way, but first, victory lap!

327
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,927
Come on, Don, Pete, Crane, Jimmy Olsen!

328
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,732
Wrap it up quickly, gents.
We have an after-party to attend.

329
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,445
Thank you, Roger.

330
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,608
-Is everyone set?
-That's one word for it.

331
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,119
Joey, you didn't start without me, did you?

332
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,696
No, Don. I would not do that.

333
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,369
Okay, everybody ready?

334
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,625
So...

335
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:26,458
Life Cereal, delicious, crispy
and it's got a big name, you know.

336
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,467
And I know you want
to associate it with health,

337
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,215
but that's not fun. Joey?

338
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,510
You know what? I've got it.

339
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,269
Look, there are sweeter cereals than this,

340
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,473
but I kept thinking about,
you know, nostalgia.

341
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:48,405
How you remember something in the past
and it feels good, but it's a little bit painful,

342
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,489
like when you were a kid.

343
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,907
-That's the truth.
-And "Life,"

344
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,322
that's a scary word to anyone at any age.

345
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,619
So how do we make it fun?

346
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,749
"Eat life by the bowlful."

347
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,870
Little kid, big bowl, big spoon.

348
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,876
Kids see the giant bowl
of cereal and they smile

349
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,083
because, you know,
they'd eat a box of it if they could.

350
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,968
And moms see it and they get this twinge

351
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,764
of how little their kid still is,
even though they have to deal with life.

352
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:19,477
Get those two together in a market
and I think we're going to sell some cereal.

353
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,095
That's all I have.

354
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,556
I think if you'd invite us
into the rest of your company,

355
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,687
we could build a Saturday morning TV show

356
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,767
around the whole Quaker Oats family.

357
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,894
In fact, it could be called
The Quaker Oats Family.

358
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,190
I like the bowlful,

359
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,527
but I think it's kind of smart
for regular folks, you Know?

360
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,701
The irony, I guess.

361
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:40,536
Children will get the picture.
Moms will get the irony.

362
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:45,454
Yeah, but when I go back to Chicago,
all they're gonna wanna hear is a slogan,

363
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,293
and I don't think this is gonna cut it.

364
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,383
Well, why don't we let Don work that over?

365
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,053
We can either talk on Monday
if you're staying the weekend

366
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,345
or we can come see you in Chicago.

367
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,422
I've got it. I've got it, Pete.

368
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,972
How about

369
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,684
"Life is just a bowl of Life Cereal."

370
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,567
"Life is sweet."

371
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,235
"Enjoy the rest of your Life Cereal."

372
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,989
Don, they're not expecting
you to do this right now.

373
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,569
Give me a second.

374
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,451
"Life. The reason to get
out of bed in the morning."

375
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,333
"Life. The cure for the common breakfast."

376
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,543
"Life. Its sweetness never ends."

377
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,001
-"Life. Eat it by the bowlful."
-There you go.

378
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,167
"The cure for the common breakfast."

379
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,170
-Love it.
-It's got the health angle.

380
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:40,842
Life makes you feel better.
It's got protein. Very nice.

381
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,352
That dog will hunt.

382
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,680
Wonderful.
We'll get that put together for you.

383
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,349
-Should we discuss media?
-I can keep going.

384
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,268
I think we've got a home run.

385
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,779
We don't need to take up
any more of your time.

386
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,486
I Know you have some celebrating to do.

387
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,817
I don't know what to say.

388
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,694
This is the most fun
I've ever had in New York.

389
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,491
Anytime, fellows.

390
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,490
Very good then.

391
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,869
Roger, I'm done! Let's go!

392
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,959
Can I speak with you a moment?

393
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,961
-Got anything on Vicks yet?
-I really need to talk to you.

394
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,883
-You still have nothing?
-The tagline...

395
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,794
Do you think I'm joking
when I give you a deadline?

396
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,471
-You said Monday.
-Ida, book a nice room with a lock on it

397
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,016
for Misters Olson and Rizzo. Bill it to Vicks.

398
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,594
-Don't come out until you have something.
-Are you kidding?

399
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,222
Pete, we'll walk them out.

400
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:34,028
Do you want to pick a place or should I?

401
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,031
He wasn't serious.
It's the weekend. We'll work in the office.

402
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,276
Do you want me to go chase him down
to see if he's serious or not?

403
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,906
Go get Stanley.

404
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,535
-I need to speak with you.
-Not now.

405
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,087
-Lane, may I?
-Come in.

406
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,013
I'm only going to ask once.
Are we merging with Geyer?

407
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,390
-No.
-Really?

408
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,020
Well, I ran into Ken Cosgrove
and Clarence Birdseye at the CLIOs.

409
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,983
It came to me
that Mr. Cosgrove was unhappy

410
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:21,613
and that he and his choice clients
would be a welcome addition to the firm.

411
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,110
Over my dead body.

412
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:32,120
I apologize.
It was wrong of me not to consult you.

413
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,580
-I wasn't sure...
-Wasn't sure about what?

414
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,832
Whether to go behind my back?

415
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:41,137
I'm a partner, damn it.
I have the same status here as you.

416
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,052
You've never liked me.

417
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,223
You picked him over me to begin with

418
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,518
and now you expect me
to work with him again?

419
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,936
Approval denied.

420
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,600
Roger Sterling is a child,

421
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,985
and frankly we can't have you
pulling the cart all by yourself.

422
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,902
Ken is proven.

423
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,662
He's hungry, and he has accounts.

424
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,627
Birds Eye, a beverage called Mountain Dew

425
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,706
and Fillmore Auto Parts,
which has entered the national arena.

426
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,046
He would more than pay for himself.

427
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,215
Does that put you at ease?

428
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,383
What would put me at ease

429
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,887
is you and Madame Defarge
not plotting behind my back.

430
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,720
Still, I expect pragmatism from you.

431
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,806
We share that.

432
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,402
Mr. Cosgrove and I
are having lunch on Monday.

433
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:43,608
If your tantrum has subsided,
you're welcome to join us.

434
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,911
-I'm going home.
-And on a personal note,

435
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,456
I'd like to add that I'm quite fond of you.

436
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,033
It pains me to hear you say otherwise.

437
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,582
Get that thing in here.

438
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,843
General.

439
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,300
You're not flying tonight, are you?

440
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,226
No, it's been years.

441
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,808
I bet. Name some aircraft for me.

442
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,649
-No.
-No, wait. Who do you report to?

443
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,272
-The president.
-Of what, William Morris?

444
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,736
You know, one of these decorations
is for shutting up loudmouths.

445
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,326
It's a pleasure to meet you, General.
Enjoy your evening.

446
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:34,075
-Don, congratulations.
-Thank you.

447
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,169
You, too. We're the top of the heap.

448
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,665
-The heap of what?
-I know they give out 50 a year,

449
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,297
but I've got to say,
it doesn't get any sweeter than this.

450
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,175
Roger, buy Ned a drink.

451
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,425
There you are.

452
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,686
Your mom called. She's looking for us.

453
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,809
It was very nice meeting you.

454
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,017
-What are you doing?
-Rescuing you.

455
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,278
From what? A business opportunity?

456
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,193
Did you see the part where I won?

457
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,274
No, but I heard about it.

458
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,657
They're gonna put your picture
on a dartboard at Grey.

459
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,118
What's their problem?

460
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,577
Grey won. Everybody won.

461
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,787
That's not true.

462
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,620
And just think how you'd feel
right now if you lost.

463
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,705
About the same, I suppose.

464
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,544
It doesn't make the work any better.

465
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,335
That's very healthy.

466
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,964
Award or no award, you're still Don Draper.

467
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,758
Whatever that means.

468
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,886
You're incredible.

469
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,980
You smell good.

470
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,312
Is that right?

471
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:51,490
What do you say we get out of here
and really celebrate?

472
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:59,161
I think you're confusing a lot of things
at once right now.

473
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,542
I'm very happy for you.

474
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,854
Are you calling to give him an update?

475
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,520
I'm calling him about something
completely unrelated to you.

476
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,564
I Know you have a special relationship.

477
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,030
-What does that mean?
-What?

478
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,863
Not that. Jesus! Of course not that.

479
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,916
Do you think he'd be caught dead with you?
There's wallpaper more exciting.

480
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,418
But I know you're his favorite.

481
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,294
I bet he takes you hunting

482
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,418
and lets you carry
the carcasses in your mouth.

483
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,921
Are you gonna work or just stare at pictures

484
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,220
of women who can't stare back?

485
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:57,260
You wouldn't understand,
but this inspires me,

486
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,721
opens my mind with freedom.

487
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:04,141
So why aren't you a nudist?

488
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,985
You talk about it all the time.

489
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,322
Well, in a liberated environment, I would be.

490
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,903
In the presence of the Pope or say, you,

491
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,246
it's difficult.

492
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,449
You don't know anything about me.

493
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:25,163
I know you're ashamed of your body,
or you should be, at least.

494
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,515
What are you doing?

495
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:44,186
You're lazy. And you have no ideas.

496
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:49,858
-Really?
-Yeah. Let's go.

497
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,066
You're a fruitcake, you know that?

498
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,110
And you're chicken shit.

499
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,287
I can work like this. Let's get liberated.

500
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,915
Fantastic.

501
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:34,861
What are you waiting for?

502
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,367
Just...

503
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,242
Let's talk cough drops. What you got?

504
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,828
I'm thinking.

505
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,247
About what?

506
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,549
Don't flatter yourself. it's involuntary.

507
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,804
Maybe it was left over from the magazine.

508
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,340
Terrific.

509
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,596
Now I don't think
it's that hard to convince people

510
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:05,930
that cough drops are medicine,
especially when they taste like it, right?

511
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,154
So you're really gonna leave me alone
with all these naked gold women?

512
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,455
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt.

513
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,827
You're not interrupting.

514
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,039
That man over there,
I saw you talking before.

515
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,454
-Is that Don Draper?
-Yes it is.

516
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,633
-Is he attached?
-To that glass? Absolutely.

517
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:35,709
No.

518
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,885
He's pretty proud of himself.

519
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,057
Well, it's a big day for him.

520
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,555
It's a big day for all of us.

521
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,891
Especially you, okay?

522
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,899
Well, they don't seem
to give awards for what I do.

523
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,272
And what is that?

524
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,317
Find guys like him.

525
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,749
You've crossed the border
from lubricated to morose.

526
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,086
Good night.

527
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,092
Mr. Sterling.

528
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,729
-Do I know you?
-it's Don.

529
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,437
Don Draper. Heller's Luxury Furs.

530
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:36,103
The fur guy.

531
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,485
-What are you doing here?
-I have a meeting in the building.

532
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,443
I saw you standing here
and I thought I'd say hello.

533
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,284
Really? Name one other company
in this building.

534
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,625
I'm sorry. It's just...

535
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,870
I've left some messages for you.

536
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:56,753
And I've ignored them.
That's my message for you.

537
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,334
I just wanted to know
what you thought of my portfolio.

538
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:01,136
I threw it out with the box from the coat.

539
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,172
That was a bad idea.

540
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,349
Maybe it was a bad idea,

541
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,269
but weren't you trying to get a break once?

542
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:16,977
Where does your boss
think you are right now?

543
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,480
He knows I want to do what you do.

544
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,240
And what do you think that is?

545
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,988
I think you're a very important man
in a very important agency.

546
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,072
Maybe I am risking my job,

547
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,705
but I'd do anything to buy you a drink
and hear anything you have to say.

548
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,454
It's 10:00 a.m.

549
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,753
My mother always said,
"Be careful what you wish for,

550
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,129
"because you'll get it,

551
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,836
"and then people get jealous
and try to take it away from you."

552
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:45,597
I don't think that's how that goes.

553
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,634
You're an expert on everything, right?

554
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,140
And how can I hire you?
You know too much about me.

555
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,100
You know I've been discreet.

556
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,683
Once you say that,
you're not discreet anymore.

557
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,689
I got to get out of here before they
open for lunch. This is embarrassing.

558
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,439
I'll buy you lunch.

559
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,694
I'm stuffed. I had a jar of olives.

560
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,541
And you're a great fur guy.
I'm gonna need one of those.

561
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,039
Let me get you a cab.

562
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,087
You should go home.

563
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,685
So you use cough drops
when you're sick in bed,

564
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,982
on a car trip, at the movies and in church.

565
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:39,814
Anything you'd like to add?

566
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,276
-What?
-This pencil's a little dull.

567
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,068
Maybe I should dip that thing
in some ink and write with it.

568
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,747
-Stop looking.
-I thought it might make it go away.

569
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,428
You know what? Fine.

570
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:11,883
Are we getting dressed now?

571
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:15,016
You can do whatever you want. I don't care.

572
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,771
But you do.

573
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,355
Fine, you win.

574
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,392
Win what?

575
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:23,649
Win the prize for the smuggest bitch
in the world.

576
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,943
I got to take a leak.

577
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,464
Hey, Rizzo! I'm hungry.
Do you want anything?

578
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,515
What did you win for again?

579
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,806
Cake mixes and toppings.

580
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,392
I wrote the jingle.

581
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,525
Can you hum a few bars?

582
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,001
That sounds familiar.

583
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,804
Okay.

584
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,403
Hello.

585
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,615
So you finally decided
to pick up the phone?

586
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,291
-Where the hell are you?
-Who is this?

587
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,120
It's me. Where the hell are you? It's noon.

588
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,206
You were supposed to be here
two hours ago.

589
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,379
The kids are sitting in the den watching TV,

590
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,631
waiting for someone
who is obviously not coming.

591
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,758
I know you don't care
that Henry and I were supposed to go

592
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,259
to a very important brunch,

593
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,387
but I can't get Carla anymore.
She's in church.

594
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,303
-I'm coming on Sunday.
-It is Sunday!

595
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,403
I'm really sorry, Betts.
I'm under the weather.

596
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,447
Well, thank you for the notice, Don.
Thanks a lot.

597
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,318
Is everything okay?

598
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,329
Yeah.

599
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,037
Everything's fine.

600
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,836
I can't believe we slept so long.

601
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,501
Is that yours?

602
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,546
No, it's yours.

603
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,935
I'm really sorry.

604
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,851
I have some things to do.
I forgot about them.

605
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,817
You said you were gonna take my picture
and you never did.

606
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:15,276
-When did I say that?
-I don't know.

607
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,075
Somewhere around
your third order of French Fries

608
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,406
after your sister left.

609
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,665
My sister?

610
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,626
Was that her on the phone?

611
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,797
-No.
-Don't lie to me. it's okay, Dick.

612
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:34,469
Listen, I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

613
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,925
Look,

614
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,812
I'm really late.

615
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,351
-I should get ready.
-Okay.

616
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,987
Do you mind?

617
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,200
I had a great time, Doris.

618
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,999
I'm really sorry I forgot I had plans.

619
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,354
All right. I'll see you around, I guess.

620
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,154
Are you okay?

621
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,114
I tried to call you Friday night,

622
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,666
and yesterday it rang and rang
and today it's busy.

623
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:30,577
My phone's not working.

624
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,250
Can I come in?

625
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,048
What's the problem?

626
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,267
I know you don't want to hear this,
but the Life Cereal tag you sold,

627
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,057
it was that kid's. Roger's idiot.

628
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,233
"Eat Life by the bowlful"?
We worked on that for weeks.

629
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:02,034
No, "The cure for the common breakfast."
You changed it in the meeting.

630
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,035
I don't think so.

631
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,113
I know I've gotten stuff
stuck in my brain before

632
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,824
and you don't know where it's coming from.

633
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,125
It's that kid's.

634
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,541
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

635
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,257
Call Life and tell them it's terrible

636
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:19,130
-and we changed our minds.
-They loved it.

637
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,209
It's terrible.

638
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,888
Well, neither you nor the client
was in a condition to notice.

639
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,677
Think of 10 more tags.

640
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,604
No. I've been working
all weekend with that pig

641
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,898
in that stupid hotel room. I am tapped out.

642
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,651
What hotel room?

643
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,528
You have to bring him in right away.

644
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,030
Tomorrow. Fix it.

645
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:50,828
Shit.

646
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,017
Mr. Cosgrove is on his way over.
I've added you to our reservation.

647
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,851
No. When he gets here
bring him to the conference room.

648
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,855
...and he's coughing
and everyone's staring at him,

649
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,407
including the priest,
then he sucks on a Vicks.

650
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,159
It's good.

651
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,116
-it's pretty much how I pitched it.
-That's true.

652
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,493
I only changed one little thing.

653
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,589
Good morning.

654
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,714
Call the Pen & Pencil,
see if someone found my award.

655
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,754
What's the category?

656
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,510
Best actress. It's a CLIO.

657
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,931
Hey.

658
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:58,975
They told me to wait here.

659
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,565
Your little friend is waiting.

660
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,699
Listen, Danny,

661
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:13,414
I've been thinking about things
and there was a slogan in your book,

662
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,992
"The cure for the common" something.

663
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,204
-Bus, beer, chair? Which one?
-All of them.

664
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,213
I'm gonna give you $50 for the idea.

665
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:23,921
You liked it, huh?

666
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,217
What did I just say?

667
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,008
I'd like a job.

668
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,718
Fine, $100. It'll be freelance work.
Do you know what that is?

669
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,933
Yeah, it's not a job.

670
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,230
I don't have to buy it.

671
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,276
I could just use it. Take the money.

672
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,438
I don't need money. I need a job.

673
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,364
You wouldn't even be in this room
if you weren't related to Roger.

674
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,735
But I am. it's all I have.

675
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,195
That and my ideas.

676
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,630
This place is fantastic.

677
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,508
Lane, could you leave us, please?

678
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,300
Certainly.

679
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,858
I've given this a lot of thought.

680
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,161
Me, too.

681
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,326
If you're open to the direction
and tenor of the business I'm doing here,

682
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,542
I think you'd be a great addition to my team.

683
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,374
The hell's that supposed to mean?

684
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,006
That things have changed
in a permanent way.

685
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,510
I'd say nothing's changed.

686
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,429
Look, Ken, everyone here likes you,

687
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:59,854
but this is a small shop,
and I need to know you can do as told.

688
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,864
So,

689
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,702
how are the wedding plans coming?

690
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,418
Peggy!

691
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,383
Take Danny over to Joan.
He's starting next Monday.

692
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,137
Are you kidding?

693
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,013
You will not be sorry.

694
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,435
Go away.

695
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,773
Wait here.

696
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,615
I always liked chocolate ice cream,
but my mother made us eat vanilla,

697
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,245
because it didn't stain anything.

698
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,414
-I hired Jane's cousin.
-Really?

699
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:09,707
What changed your mind?

700
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,255
Couldn't live without him.

701
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:18,637
Well, one good turn deserves another.

702
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,481
You left it at the bar.

703
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,938
Too much celebrating, I guess.

704
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,444
Yeah, that happens.

705
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,527
I'll give it back if you just say one thing.

706
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,654
You couldn't have done it without me.

707
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,284
Did I not say that?

708
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,372
I was wrong.

709
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,455
Thank you.

710
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,303
Mr. Sterling.

711
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,188
-Good morning.
-Jesus! Would you leave me alone?

712
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,441
You told me to come in.

713
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,194
-The hell I did.
-You hired me.

714
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,481
What? When?

715
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,658
Yesterday. You said, "Welcome aboard."

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
