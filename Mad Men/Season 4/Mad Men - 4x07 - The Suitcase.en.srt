2
00:01:07,647 --> 00:01:08,780
...Five, six, seven,

3
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:11,383
eight, nine, 10, 11.

4
00:01:11,568 --> 00:01:12,170
That's two for the Campbells...

5
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:13,088
Where are these exactly?

6
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:14,785
It's a movie theater, no bad seats...

7
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:16,485
The Cosgroves,

8
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:19,486
and Joey, Stan, Danny... $10 each.

9
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,417
How come we have to pay

10
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:22,068
when everyone knows damn
well they were free?

11
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,729
You're such a jew.

12
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:26,640
Your friends in Hollywood
know you talk that way?

13
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,545
And let me tell you...
You're the jew,

14
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,781
trying to make 30 bucks on
something you got for free.

15
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:33,778
25 on Clay by a knockout.

16
00:01:34,142 --> 00:01:35,383
Liston is favored for a reason.

17
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,976
- Cassius Clay is scared.
- Of what, pray tell?

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,333
He had an elevated heart
rate before the last fight.

19
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:42,263
Who says that means you're scared?

20
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:44,707
It happens to me all the time.
It runs in my family.

21
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:47,337
Liston has the weight.
And he's never been knocked out.

22
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:48,223
Sonny's old.

23
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,798
He's experienced.

24
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:51,712
Don, I've got your ticket.

25
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:53,791
You want to put something down?

26
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,326
Stan's got a barber who makes book.

27
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:56,333
Yeah, who do you like?

28
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,204
I was just saying

29
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:59,037
I think Clay'd make
one hell of an adman.

30
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:01,881
You're right. Gimme 100 on Liston.

31
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:05,781
Joining us for a little
pre-fight steak and cocktails

32
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:06,492
at the Palm?

33
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,802
Absolutely. Samsonite team,
in my office.

34
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,819
Listen, if it comes up with Jennifer,

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,292
I did pay for the seats.

36
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,444
Can you make a dinner
reservation before the bout

37
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:20,748
for Mr. Sterling and me
anywhere but the Palm?

38
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,865
I don't know why everyone
cares so much about it.

39
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:25,131
If I wanted to see two negroes fight,

40
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:26,946
I'd throw a dollar bill out my window.

41
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:29,944
I thought we were doing
this at 9:00. It's 11:15.

42
00:02:30,158 --> 00:02:32,426
I'm late, but you're not.
Good work so far.

43
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,884
- Where do you want me?
- Behind the desk is fine.

44
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:47,562
You're in a white studio,
like in some limbo.

45
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,577
There's two no-name
football players holding

46
00:02:50,578 --> 00:02:52,779
an American tourister and a skyway

47
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:55,981
going against Mr. Joe Namath

48
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:58,803
and his defender, a sexy girl

49
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,437
holding a Samsonite,
and maybe a referee.

50
00:03:01,737 --> 00:03:04,610
So we hear "hut hut, hike!"
Namath fades back.

51
00:03:04,611 --> 00:03:05,850
"Oh no, it's a blitz!"...

52
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:11,755
Punch in on Namath,
he says something like...

53
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,746
"The secret to victory
on the road is Samsonite.

54
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:15,207
I carry it because it's tough

55
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,963
and no matter what comes at me,
I know I'm protected."

56
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:21,716
As they fall,

57
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:24,299
the competitors will bust open,
clothing flying out.

58
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,615
Touchdown, Samsonite!

59
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,790
- "I've got it, honey."
- "You sure do, Joe."

60
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:30,692
"Samsonite... it's tough."

61
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,419
Endorsements are lazy,

62
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,046
and I don't like Joe Namath.

63
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:40,721
He hasn't even played in
a professional game yet.

64
00:03:41,281 --> 00:03:42,407
He's very handsome.

65
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:44,409
And women don't buy suitcases.

66
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:45,861
Dr. Faye says they do.

67
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:48,754
Could you leave us, please?

68
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,806
Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment

69
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,579
where you feel free to fail.

70
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:05,137
You wanted to go with Danny's idea.

71
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,233
Because it works...

72
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:08,060
"Only Samsonite is tough."

73
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:09,907
It's the execution that's the problem.

74
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,309
- Okay, should it be funny?
- Actually funny?

75
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,574
Maybe. Funny like what I just saw? No.

76
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:38,111
- Hello.
- You remembered my birthday.

77
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:40,717
Did you open my present?

78
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,114
I am. Hold on.

79
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:52,839
My goodness.

80
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,287
I'm finally doing what I
should've done years ago.

81
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,052
Phillips-Olson- something probably,

82
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,651
but I'll need you.
I want to form an agency

83
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:03,070
that specializes in
women's products with you

84
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:04,370
as my creative director.

85
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:06,114
I don't know what to say.

86
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:07,762
But you're smiling, right?

87
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,424
I have some very...
Sort of a little under the table,

88
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:14,067
but very high-level talks
with the people at Tampax.

89
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:17,625
Peggy, it's Tampax.
50% market share.

90
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,067
I mean they're really up there.

91
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:20,843
Plus that queer at belle jolie

92
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:22,089
has been barking up my tree.

93
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,182
Plus I have my European connections.

94
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:25,432
It sounds exciting.

95
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:26,778
The train's leaving the station, honey.

96
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:27,868
Get onboard.

97
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:33,370
Where am I calling you?

98
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:36,059
I'm in my office at home.

99
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,606
So you already told Grey?

100
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,989
I'm not wasting my talents
over there anymore.

101
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:42,348
Believe me, it was mutual.

102
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:45,154
Duck, did you lose your job?

103
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,146
Peggy, this is good.

104
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,460
I'm not gonna lie.

105
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:51,524
I was a little inspired by what Draper did.

106
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:53,670
Now I just need some accounts.

107
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,789
It's tough because, well...

108
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:58,899
It's tough to get a credit line.

109
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:01,628
So what do you have so far?

110
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,248
I know it's not a diamond necklace,

111
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:04,813
but I did spend some
money on those cards.

112
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,452
And I appreciate the gesture.

113
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:09,546
It's just...

114
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,371
I don't know whether
to take this seriously,

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,152
because I suspect
you've been drinking.

116
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:16,754
Well, you're wrong.

117
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:19,079
I heard about the clios.

118
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:20,890
I have to see you tonight.

119
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:22,841
I have plans.

120
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:25,133
What, with that Mark?
He's another one.

121
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:27,646
Duck, you are a
valuable account man.

122
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:29,385
You have a bright future.

123
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:31,810
You just need to go to one
of those headhunters and...

124
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:34,829
- I need to see you, babe.
- Don't do that.

125
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,337
Peg, I'm falling apart.

126
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:40,702
Don't you know you're the last thing

127
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:42,338
that made me feel good about myself?

128
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:45,681
Pull your hands out of your panties.

129
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:48,998
I can't talk right now....

130
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:51,952
I want to see you tonight.

131
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,531
You been farting in here?

132
00:06:58,792 --> 00:06:59,700
I have to go.

133
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:09,094
We're going to lunch.

134
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,770
I don't know if you could tell,
but he hated it.

135
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:14,005
I was hating it too
while we were doing it,

136
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:16,379
but not before. I'm not gonna lie.

137
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:19,416
So we're back to the drawing board.
Still gotta eat.

138
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:21,556
Come on, it's your birthday.

139
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:23,382
We'll let you talk through lunch.

140
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:27,582
You got a call

141
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,812
while you were in the
toilet to the direct line...

142
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,148
Stephanie from California,

143
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,188
no last name. She says it's urgent.

144
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:38,551
- Would you like me to place the call?
- No, I've got it.

145
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,365
Bad news. Our night is ruined.

146
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,222
I took care of that.

147
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:17,710
The kids are going to the Palm.

148
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,818
We are going anywhere else.

149
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,237
Well, the brotherhood of
alcoholics anonymous...

150
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:24,771
Freddy and Cal Rutledge from Pond's

151
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:27,324
will be joining us for
dinner and the fight,

152
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:28,517
which means we'll have to

153
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:30,167
drink before dinner if
we want to drink at all.

154
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:31,930
And then there's all
the talk about drinking

155
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:33,368
where they start with the funny stories

156
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:34,496
and they end up crying.

157
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:37,426
Again.

158
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,239
15 months I've been
waiting for this fight.

159
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,415
$300. Liston has to
lose by unconsciousness.

160
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:47,387
- Get rid of 'em.
- I can't.

161
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:51,919
- I should work on Samsonite.
- That's in two weeks.

162
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,971
I'm gonna be in Florida.
Now this is your job too.

163
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:57,775
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry. You can do that without me.

164
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:00,219
- Samsonite you can't.
- Are you serious?

165
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:01,994
We can solve this problem with a flask.

166
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:04,972
No, I wouldn't be good company anyway.

167
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:06,825
That's never bothered me before.

168
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:44,769
I don't know what it is,

169
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,620
but I look at the side of your neck

170
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,622
and I wish I had one of
those James Bond pens

171
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,745
so I could jam a dart in it.

172
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,223
James Bond likes to travel.
He goes all over the world.

173
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,412
He goes underwater.
He met a girl underwater.

174
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:03,071
I think this is a good place to stop.

175
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:05,264
See you tomorrow.

176
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:10,173
Oh, great.

177
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,701
I don't like sitting at my desk

178
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,360
and looking into a garbage dump.

179
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,106
Although I am paid less,
I am still not a janitor.

180
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:25,642
Thank you, gentlemen.

181
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:30,127
Doing something special
for your birthday?

182
00:10:30,651 --> 00:10:32,017
Mark is taking me to dinner...

183
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:34,314
The forum of the Twelve Caesars.

184
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,277
- Ooh.
- Yes.

185
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,081
- How old are you?
- 26 today.

186
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,916
Well, you're doing all right, aren't you?

187
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:49,284
Well, hello.

188
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,990
- Did I hear it's your birthday?
- It is.

189
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:57,293
- How are you feeling?
- Well, of course my days are

190
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:59,659
spent sleeping and
visiting the ladies' room,

191
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:02,011
although it's an incredible feeling

192
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:03,471
having this baby kick me.

193
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,213
Is it any different than living with Pete?

194
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:08,819
You're witty.

195
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,326
I always assumed that,
but it turns out it's true.

196
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:15,673
Are you going to watch the fight?

197
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:18,476
Oh, yes. I've been watching boxing

198
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,651
since I was a little girl.

199
00:11:20,832 --> 00:11:22,605
My father loves blood sport.

200
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,627
Mr. Draper's looking for you.

201
00:11:27,378 --> 00:11:28,606
I'm sorry. I have to go.

202
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:33,008
Happy Birthday.

203
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,624
You know, 26 is still very young.

204
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:44,845
Have fun.

205
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,126
I want a rare steak and I want to see

206
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:50,953
those two men pound each other.

207
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:53,048
Cynthia's at the restaurant.
We should go.

208
00:11:53,497 --> 00:11:55,035
What about Jennifer?

209
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:57,200
Oh, don't go in there. Don't do it.

210
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:02,345
- She's dead.
- Let's beat it before it's us.

211
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:07,652
- I was just on my way out.
- Did you get California?

212
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:10,073
Do you want me to try before I depart?

213
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:12,162
There's a time difference, you know.

214
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:14,498
I do, but it goes the other way.

215
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:16,754
Good night, Mr. Draper.

216
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:19,486
Get in here.

217
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,656
Why don't you talk to
Joan and get rid of her?

218
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,362
No, Joan knew exactly what I needed

219
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:26,946
and made sure that I got it.

220
00:12:27,986 --> 00:12:29,690
So where are we on Samsonite?

221
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:31,396
We'll have something to
show you in the morning.

222
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:33,297
But the suspense is killing me.

223
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:36,629
Well, I kind of was on my way out.

224
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:38,440
Let me just see where we are.

225
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,041
I guess I've got a minute.

226
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:08,832
Okay. We thought that Samsonite is

227
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,085
this very rare element,
this mythical substance,

228
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:14,004
the hardest on Earth.
and we see an adventurer

229
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:15,482
leaping through a cave.

230
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,066
Is this a substance much like bullshit?

231
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,452
I thought we could drop
one off the Eiffel Tower

232
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:23,593
with a countdown. Like the moonshot...

233
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,164
And show how it doesn't break.

234
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:28,414
- But it would, wouldn't it?
- Probably.

235
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,255
The government has prohibited us

236
00:13:31,256 --> 00:13:32,319
from doing things like that, Peggy.

237
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,501
They feel that it is not
in the public interest.

238
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:37,956
We have a thing with Samson,

239
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:40,867
because he's strong... And his hair.

240
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,023
I gave you more responsibility

241
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,012
and you didn't do anything?

242
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:47,907
That you like. We did work... a lot.

243
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:49,100
I don't care if you work 10 seconds

244
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:50,682
if you bring me something I like.

245
00:13:51,272 --> 00:13:52,373
We're going to do this right now.

246
00:13:55,826 --> 00:13:56,994
Oh, I know you have plans.

247
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:00,350
You were going to call me
from a bar with an idea?

248
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:02,200
Do you think elves do this?

249
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:04,716
You're just gonna change it anyway.

250
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,052
Excuse me?!

251
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:21,899
- This is Mark Kerney.
- I am so sorry.

252
00:14:22,267 --> 00:14:24,799
I got drawn into his web.
It's gonna be a while.

253
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,802
A while like soon,
or a while like I should cancel?

254
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,314
15 minutes? It shouldn't take too long.

255
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:32,707
- He's going to the boxing match.
- He's going to Maine?

256
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:34,462
You can watch it on closed-circuit tv

257
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:36,296
in the movie theaters. We got tickets.

258
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:37,876
How come we didn't go?

259
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:41,294
Because we're having a romantic
dinner for my birthday.

260
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,483
Well, did you tell him that?

261
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:45,951
Look, I'm the only one who
can help him with this

262
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,935
and the sooner I get off the phone,

263
00:14:46,936 --> 00:14:48,063
the sooner I can come.

264
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:49,287
Just hurry, will you?

265
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,027
She's gonna be a few minutes late.

266
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,740
A surprise on top of a surprise.

267
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:57,869
She works too hard.

268
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,052
"The oysters of Hercules,

269
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,730
which you with sword shall carve."

270
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,771
I saw a tray pass by.
They look like hockey pucks.

271
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:09,146
$1.65. You should let Gerry get this.

272
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:11,601
Mom, don't cut the kid off at the knees.

273
00:15:18,214 --> 00:15:20,816
Now what if an elephant either sits on

274
00:15:20,884 --> 00:15:22,251
or steps on the suitcase?

275
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:29,859
How about a slow-moving
airplane runs it over?

276
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:31,509
Do you like Cassius Clay?

277
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:35,765
- He's very handsome.
- I don't think so.

278
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:37,299
You're not supposed to.

279
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,536
I remember my mother talking
about Nat King Cole in a way

280
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,438
that made my father throw
out all his records.

281
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:45,805
He's got a big mouth.

282
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:50,377
"I'm the greatest."
" Not if you have to say it."

283
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,647
Muhammad Ali.

284
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:56,152
Do you like the airplane?

285
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:57,920
Liston just goes about his business,

286
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:01,357
works methodically.

287
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,560
Clay will dance and talk,

288
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:06,462
throw a few until he's wiped out.

289
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:09,988
A bag under an airplane looks like

290
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:11,067
there's been an accident.

291
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,777
Three classes of suitcase...

292
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:18,483
Featherweight, middleweight, heavyweight.

293
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:20,846
For whatever class you're in.

294
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,482
But how do you do that on tv?

295
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:26,528
- What's the story?
- You don't like it?

296
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:30,553
No, I love it. That's great.
That's what we should do.

297
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:38,127
Let it ring.

298
00:16:40,697 --> 00:16:41,680
I'll say you're not here.

299
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,400
Hello? Oh hello, Roger.

300
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:46,268
No, he's not here.

301
00:16:46,953 --> 00:16:49,094
I answer other people's
phones all the time.

302
00:16:49,748 --> 00:16:51,576
I'm going to count to three,
then I'm gonna start saying

303
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,140
a lot of words you don't like, sweetheart.

304
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,751
- This should be good.
- I'm begging you...

305
00:16:57,014 --> 00:16:58,510
Get down here right away.

306
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:00,316
You think I'd rather be working?

307
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,676
Yeah, I do. Did you know

308
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:03,886
Freddy Rumsen collects Indian arrowheads?

309
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:06,622
Where are you?

310
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,591
There's a bar next to Keenes.

311
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,459
I've been sneaking off to fortify myself.

312
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,595
Tell 'em you're sick. Go home.

313
00:17:12,662 --> 00:17:14,575
I am sick. I think I overdid it.

314
00:17:15,305 --> 00:17:17,094
And they're self-so-righteous.

315
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:18,869
I never pissed my pants.

316
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:21,751
This guy Rutledge killed
a man with a motorboat.

317
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,689
You know what gets you
over something like that?

318
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,626
Drinking.

319
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,517
Still got your ticket.

320
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:29,707
It's an attractive offer.

321
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:32,110
Look out your window. Can you see me?

322
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:35,569
Good night, sweetheart.

323
00:17:39,756 --> 00:17:41,624
Go ahead. I'll wait.

324
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,941
- Hello.
- 15 minutes? It's almost an hour.

325
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:54,623
I'm so sorry. I'm gonna leave any minute.

326
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:56,390
Did you at least have something?

327
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:58,034
You have to get down here.

328
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,259
You have to get down here right away.

329
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:03,779
I can't just leave, okay?

330
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:06,182
But you have to, okay?

331
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:08,217
You know what? Just go to my
apartment and wait for me.

332
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:09,266
We can eat there another time.

333
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:11,715
No, I don't want to do that.

334
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:14,517
- I'll make it worth your while.
- Damn it, Peggy.

335
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:15,494
I've got your whole family here

336
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,236
for a surprise dinner, okay?

337
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:18,991
And the only way you can make it worse

338
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:20,277
is by not coming at all.

339
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,263
Oh, Mark.

340
00:18:24,074 --> 00:18:26,949
I'm so sorry. I'm coming right now.

341
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:28,387
Thank you.

342
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,298
Well, so much for the surprise.

343
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,051
Okay, I'm going to leave if
that's all right with you.

344
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:44,053
I'm not so sure about it.

345
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:45,715
I mean every time we get into this,

346
00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:47,499
we abandon the toughness idea.

347
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,173
Maybe there's something to the elephant.

348
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:53,760
Do you want one?

349
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:00,068
I'm sorry. Do you have someplace to be?

350
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:03,882
Maybe tap your foot so I get the message.

351
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:06,116
I was supposed to be
at dinner an hour ago.

352
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:08,196
It's my birthday, and I'm pretty sure

353
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:09,162
I ruined everything.

354
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:11,414
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

355
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:13,148
Because I thought this
would take a second.

356
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:14,850
So now I'm supposed to feel like crap?

357
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:17,453
Oh, I'm so sick that I
ruined her birthday.

358
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,010
Do you know when my birthday is?

359
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,593
- I was your secretary!
- Well, enjoy your evening!

360
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:26,654
By the way, you are
20-something years old.

361
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,036
It's time to get over birthdays.

362
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,078
Go ahead. I'll do it myself.

363
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:53,000
Yes, I'm that important.

364
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:56,273
So the fact that you're calling means

365
00:19:56,274 --> 00:19:57,446
that you haven't left yet.

366
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:00,143
I'm not gonna be able to make it at all.

367
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:02,334
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry,

368
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,285
but no one asked you to do this.

369
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:06,655
You said you never had a surprise.

370
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,576
I can't believe you.

371
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:10,986
This is your mother speaking.

372
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:12,983
Hello, ma.

373
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:14,643
I just want you to know
that we're all here...

374
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:16,793
Me, Anita, Gerry, the roommate...

375
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,282
And we're not leaving
until you march in here.

376
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:22,470
I can't, okay? Could you
put Mark on the phone?

377
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,263
He's crestfallen, you know?

378
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,039
- Mrs. Olson, it's okay.
- It's not okay.

379
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:29,617
Now he's making excuses for you.

380
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,775
I don't know how many nice boys

381
00:20:31,776 --> 00:20:33,432
you think are lining up for you.

382
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:36,599
You should be grateful. Okay, goodbye.

383
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:41,470
- Hello?
- I'm sorry I ruined this

384
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:42,586
and I'm sorry you had to spend the evening

385
00:20:42,587 --> 00:20:43,543
with my mother.

386
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:45,499
You know what? She's right.

387
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,530
Really? Then why don't you date her?

388
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:49,365
She's never even had a job.

389
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:51,627
How the hell are you mad at me?

390
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:53,513
Because you used my
birthday to get in good

391
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:55,647
with a bunch of people who drive me crazy.

392
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:57,896
Should I have invited Don?
You never stand him up.

393
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:01,645
What's the point of doing
anything nice for you?

394
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,708
Jesus. You even sound like my mother.

395
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,693
I'm already into this place for $40.

396
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:07,590
If you don't mind,
I'm going to enjoy my dinner

397
00:21:07,908 --> 00:21:09,725
and you enjoy your work.

398
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,705
The fact that you would stay there...

399
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:13,623
You know what?

400
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,083
- Forget it.
- No. What?

401
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:19,872
You want to do this right now?

402
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:21,800
- Do what?
- Fine.

403
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:24,600
It's been nice knowing you.
Happy Birthday.

404
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:29,184
- So that's it?
- Yup. Good night.

405
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:35,024
Hello?

406
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:40,786
It'll be fine.

407
00:21:41,553 --> 00:21:43,398
Couples fight. Ask Gerry.

408
00:21:56,513 --> 00:21:58,680
What's wrong? Elevator out?

409
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:02,070
I think I just broke up with Mark.

410
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:05,343
Oh. Really?

411
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,023
I think so.

412
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:09,601
So go home.

413
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:12,686
Nope. I'm ready to work.

414
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:14,396
You win. Again.

415
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:18,322
You could've just told
me it was your birthday.

416
00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:20,840
Right, and there'd
be no repercussions.

417
00:22:21,103 --> 00:22:23,245
- So now this is my fault?
- Well, it's not my fault

418
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:25,262
you don't have a family,
friends or anywhere else to go.

419
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:29,285
Go. Go. Run to him like in the movies.

420
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:32,221
- You don't have to be here.
- I do have to be here

421
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:33,995
because of some stupid idea from Danny

422
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:35,716
who you had to hire because you stole

423
00:22:35,717 --> 00:22:38,205
his other stupid idea
because you were drunk.

424
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:41,089
Don't get personal because
you didn't do your work.

425
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,346
And by the way, I know it kills you,

426
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:47,091
but guess what: there is no "Danny's idea".

427
00:22:47,415 --> 00:22:49,330
Everything that comes in
here belongs to the agency.

428
00:22:49,331 --> 00:22:50,560
You mean you.

429
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:54,536
- As long as you still work here.
- Is that a threat?

430
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:55,618
Because I've already taken somebody up

431
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:56,912
on one of those tonight.

432
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,012
- Relax.
- You know what?

433
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:00,613
Here's a blank piece of paper.

434
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,370
Why don't you turn that into Glo-coat?

435
00:23:02,575 --> 00:23:03,576
Are you out of your mind?

436
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:05,755
You gave me 20 ideas

437
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,297
and I picked out one of them

438
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:09,389
that was a kernel that
became that commercial.

439
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:11,294
- So you remember.
- I do.

440
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,288
It was something about a cowboy.
Congratulations.

441
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:15,958
No, it was something about
a kid locked in a closet

442
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:17,076
because his mother was making him wait

443
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:18,160
for the floor to dry,

444
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:19,628
which is basically the whole commercial.

445
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:22,331
- It's a kernel.
- Which you changed just enough

446
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:24,867
- so that it was yours.
- I changed it into a commercial.

447
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:25,510
What, are we going to shoot him

448
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:26,875
in the dark in the closet?

449
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:28,781
That's the way it works.

450
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,500
There are no credits on commercials.

451
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:33,506
- But you got the Clio!
- It's your job!

452
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:36,198
I give you money, you give me ideas.

453
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:37,707
And you never say thank you.

454
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,237
That's what the money is for!

455
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:42,621
You're young. You will
get your recognition.

456
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,894
And honestly, it is absolutely ridiculous

457
00:23:45,136 --> 00:23:48,131
to be two years into your
career and counting your ideas.

458
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,161
Everything to you is an opportunity.

459
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:54,223
And you should be
thanking me every morning

460
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:54,841
when you wake up,

461
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:57,534
along with Jesus,
for giving you another day!

462
00:24:00,103 --> 00:24:02,304
Oh, come on.

463
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,146
I'm sorry about your boyfriend, okay?

464
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:39,746
May 25th. Ideas for Samsonite.

465
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:44,284
Toughness means that...

466
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:09,209
Peggy, get in here.

467
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:11,811
- No.
- Come on.

468
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:13,176
You have to come in here right now.

469
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:16,883
What do you want?

470
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:18,785
You have to hear this. Sit down.

471
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:21,921
Come on. Sit.

472
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,680
So this is tape #4

473
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:34,372
of "Sterling's gold," by Roger Sterling.

474
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,874
So where was I?

475
00:25:42,102 --> 00:25:44,258
Burt Cooper hated me and I thought it was

476
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,636
because he thought I'd
be an ally of my father,

477
00:25:47,869 --> 00:25:49,608
but it turned out it was something to do

478
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:50,927
with my joie de vivre,

479
00:25:51,295 --> 00:25:52,793
my romantic prowess...

480
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,036
See tape #3...

481
00:25:56,147 --> 00:25:58,985
Including some time with
the queen of perversions,

482
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:01,449
his secretary Ida Blankenship.

483
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:05,032
You know what? Don't use her name.

484
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,829
But it was all about him
hating my very youth,

485
00:26:11,035 --> 00:26:13,548
all because the poor guy had been cut down

486
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:14,877
in the height of his sexual prime

487
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:17,166
by an unnecessary orchiectomy.

488
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:20,480
Lyle Evans, M.D.

489
00:26:20,547 --> 00:26:21,814
I think he had him killed.

490
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:24,138
Anyway, sometime in the summer of '48...

491
00:26:25,133 --> 00:26:26,562
No, 1932...

492
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,356
No, 1939.

493
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:34,897
Why are you laughing?

494
00:26:35,696 --> 00:26:37,263
It's like reading someone's diary.

495
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:39,599
Come on. Ida was a hellcat?

496
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:41,801
Cooper lost his balls?

497
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,202
Roger's writing a book?

498
00:26:48,876 --> 00:26:49,957
I should go.

499
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:52,971
- Stay and visit.
- I've got nothing to say.

500
00:26:53,681 --> 00:26:56,737
- Sure you do.
- No, it's personal.

501
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,056
We have personal conversations.

502
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,750
No, we don't, and I think
you like it that way.

503
00:27:01,751 --> 00:27:03,359
I know I do.

504
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:06,911
Suit yourself.

505
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:10,396
We're supposed to be staring at each other

506
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,544
over candlelight and he invites my mother?

507
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,309
He doesn't know me.

508
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:18,389
It's not my fault.

509
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:23,776
I guess I'm back to square one.

510
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:25,922
Single.

511
00:27:27,348 --> 00:27:29,549
Well, as Danny would say,

512
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,651
there's no use crying
over fish in the sea.

513
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:37,795
Mouse!

514
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:39,784
Over there!

515
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:46,659
- What are you doing?
- Get the suitcase.

516
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,336
- Why?
- I'm gonna seal it up in my nice Samsonite

517
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:52,572
- and throw it off the roof.
- Don't.

518
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:54,841
Come on. Every idea you have
is some version of that.

519
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:58,144
Let's do it.
Where'd you go, Mickey?

520
00:27:58,212 --> 00:28:01,547
- I think it's a rat.
- It's a mouse.

521
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:03,175
I grew up on a farm.

522
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:08,486
You know what?

523
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:11,457
There's a way out of this
room we don't know about.

524
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,064
Are you okay?

525
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:21,294
I think that's yours.

526
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,482
It's probably Mark.
I don't want to answer it.

527
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,131
It's still your birthday.

528
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:29,120
Let me get you dinner.

529
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:36,652
What's the most exciting
thing about a suitcase?

530
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:40,354
Going somewhere.

531
00:28:41,674 --> 00:28:43,189
The Acropolis.

532
00:28:44,925 --> 00:28:45,893
I'd like to go to Greece.

533
00:28:46,745 --> 00:28:48,579
I heard all the good cooks stayed there.

534
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:51,459
I'd like to just go on a plane.
I've never been.

535
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:54,241
- Is that right?
- I've heard about it, obviously.

536
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:56,646
I've seen it in the movies.

537
00:28:57,337 --> 00:28:58,813
It's an incredible idea... Flying.

538
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,827
I remember on the way to Korea

539
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:03,993
they told us how many thousand
feet in the air we were.

540
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:06,779
There was some other kid there...

541
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,296
More of a yokel than me, even.

542
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:12,939
And he screamed, "man wasn't meant to fly!"

543
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,063
Cooper has no testicles?

544
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:26,466
Ick. I don't want water.

545
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:30,733
My Uncle Max said he had a suitcase

546
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:32,310
that was always packed.

547
00:29:33,554 --> 00:29:36,459
He said, "a man has to be
ready to go at any moment."

548
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,474
Jesus. Maybe it's a metaphor.

549
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:42,748
There's something to that idea.

550
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,616
I don't know.

551
00:29:46,553 --> 00:29:47,378
I can't tell the difference anymore

552
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:50,511
between something that's good
and something that's awful.

553
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:53,657
Well, they're very close.

554
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:57,233
But the best idea always wins

555
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,321
and you'll know it when you see it.

556
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:02,055
Keep banging your head against the wall

557
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:04,403
then it happens.

558
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,109
And then it's done.

559
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,931
Yes, ma'am.

560
00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:11,741
Not like everything else in my life.

561
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,544
I mean, I know what I'm supposed to want,

562
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:18,071
but it just never feels right

563
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:21,875
or as important as anything in that office.

564
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:28,505
- I didn't know you were in Korea.
- Very briefly.

565
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,261
Did you shoot anybody?

566
00:30:31,865 --> 00:30:34,050
Nope. I saw some people get killed.

567
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:36,235
That's memorable.

568
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:38,500
My father died right in front of me.

569
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:41,118
Heart attack. I was 12.

570
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:44,148
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It was pretty violent.

571
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:45,781
The tv was on.

572
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,179
That's why I hate sports.

573
00:30:49,328 --> 00:30:50,658
Nobody was around...

574
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:53,286
Saturday afternoon.
My mother was shopping.

575
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,288
I saw my father die too.

576
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:58,791
He was kicked by a horse.

577
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,527
You're kidding.

578
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,034
- What about your mother?
- I never knew her.

579
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,140
Why is there a dog in the Parthenon?

580
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:20,880
That is a roach.
Let's go someplace darker.

581
00:31:30,802 --> 00:31:33,917
I hate dating. I'm terrible at it.

582
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,040
You'll find someone.

583
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:38,840
You know you're cute as hell.

584
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:43,751
Men don't exactly stop
and stare in the streets.

585
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:45,716
Do you want that?

586
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,018
That's not what you were supposed to say.

587
00:31:48,086 --> 00:31:50,154
What do you care what I think?

588
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:56,193
Well, everybody thinks I slept with you

589
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:57,368
to get the job.

590
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,956
They joke about it,

591
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:01,999
like it's so funny

592
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:04,768
because the possibility was so remote.

593
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:08,439
It's not because you aren't attractive.

594
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:12,476
I have to keep rules about work.

595
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:14,678
I have to.

596
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,881
You're an attractive girl, Peggy.

597
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:22,137
Not as attractive as some
of your other secretaries,

598
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:23,116
I guess.

599
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:30,387
You don't want to start
giving me morality lessons,

600
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:31,356
do you?

601
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:36,066
People do things, right?

602
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:43,314
My mother thinks you were responsible,

603
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:44,690
because you were the only person

604
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:46,631
who visited me in the hospital.

605
00:32:47,912 --> 00:32:48,686
Jesus. Really?

606
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:50,652
She hates you.

607
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:56,457
Do you know who it was?

608
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:58,522
Of course I do.

609
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:02,881
Do you ever think about it?

610
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:07,243
I try not to.

611
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,605
But then it comes up out of nowhere.

612
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:15,994
Playgrounds.

613
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:24,381
Get up!

614
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:26,050
Get up!

615
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:28,986
- Come on! Get up!
- Get up!

616
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:31,221
- Come on, get up!
- Get up.

617
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:33,490
- Come on.
- Come on, get up!

618
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:36,460
Get up! Get up!

619
00:33:36,528 --> 00:33:38,996
- Come on, get up!
- Come on, get up!

620
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:41,265
Get up! Get up, bum!

621
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,101
- Come on.
- It's a fix.

622
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:46,294
- The fix is in.
- What happened?

623
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:49,188
- It's over.
- Already? Who won?

624
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:53,031
- Clay.
- Don't believe that for a second.

625
00:33:53,603 --> 00:33:55,149
No one goes down like that.

626
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,772
That's what the man just said.

627
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:01,644
Some fight. I lost 100 bucks
in two minutes.

628
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:05,846
Let's go back, pack up and go home.

629
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:11,842
Damn elevator's like a rocket.

630
00:34:13,056 --> 00:34:14,233
I think I'm gonna be sick.

631
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:28,445
Are you okay?

632
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:44,121
Do you want any water?

633
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:47,865
What?

634
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:52,436
I have toothpaste and a
toothbrush in my desk.

635
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:57,265
Peggy?...

636
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:02,607
- Peggy.
- I'll be right back.

637
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:06,821
Peggy?

638
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:12,909
Duck?

639
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:19,863
What are you doing?

640
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,202
Leaving Draper a little present.

641
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,798
Don't! That's disgusting.

642
00:35:23,597 --> 00:35:24,776
Would you let me concentrate?

643
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:26,654
This is Roger's office.

644
00:35:28,606 --> 00:35:30,278
Now come one. Pull up your pants.

645
00:35:36,188 --> 00:35:37,422
I'm not going anywhere

646
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:39,452
without you.

647
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,921
Baby. Baby, I need you so bad.

648
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,672
You wouldn't answer your phone

649
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:50,820
and your roommate said
you were still at work.

650
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:54,808
Why didn't you answer the phone, peewee?

651
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:00,685
What's going on?

652
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,840
Just go lay down.

653
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:05,509
You don't belong in here.

654
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:08,345
So, Peggy, I see you're not alone.

655
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,583
I guess when screwing me
couldn't get you anything,

656
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,084
you had to go back to Draper.

657
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:15,285
- Duck, let's go.
- No.

658
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:19,523
That's right. We were in love.

659
00:36:21,226 --> 00:36:23,427
Turns out she's just another whore.

660
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:25,762
Hey!

661
00:36:29,492 --> 00:36:30,971
Jesus! Would you stop?!

662
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:39,400
Stop it! You're both drunk!

663
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:42,613
You know, I killed 17 men at Okinawa.

664
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:46,478
Uncle.

665
00:36:49,254 --> 00:36:50,930
What the hell is wrong with you?

666
00:36:51,222 --> 00:36:52,890
You still think you're better than me?

667
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:58,810
Come on, Peggy. Let's go.

668
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:35,999
I got rid of him. Are you okay?

669
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:39,436
Yeah.

670
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:42,486
Are you?

671
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:48,192
I, uh... I never thought...

672
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:50,336
I'm so sorry. I...

673
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:55,018
You know what? I don't
know why I was with him.

674
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:57,321
- It was a confusing time.
- Stop.

675
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,958
You don't have to explain.

676
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,312
Can you get me a drink?

677
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:11,034
How long are you gonna go on like this?

678
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,371
I have to make a phone call

679
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:17,040
and I know it's going to be bad, okay?

680
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:19,676
Oh.

681
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,212
Do you want to be alone?

682
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:25,248
Just make me a drink.

683
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:01,818
Sorry if I embarrassed you.

684
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:03,353
Shh.

685
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:56,662
- Hello.
- It's me.

686
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,029
She's gone.

687
00:41:02,207 --> 00:41:03,216
I know.

688
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,781
She wanted you to know.

689
00:41:08,518 --> 00:41:10,286
I'm sorry I didn't call. I was...

690
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:16,519
Did she want to talk to me?

691
00:41:17,527 --> 00:41:19,924
You know, she wasn't really there.

692
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,196
I'm coming out.

693
00:41:28,793 --> 00:41:29,898
I'll make the arrangements.

694
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:33,830
No need. She left her body to science.

695
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,391
She said that she wanted to go

696
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:39,267
to U.C.L.A. Medical School
tuition-free.

697
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:41,670
Of course she did.

698
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,740
I'm coming out.
I'll take care of the house.

699
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:51,758
I'd like to stay here
if that's okay with you,

700
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:53,518
take some time off from school.

701
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:58,759
Of course. That's fine.

702
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:02,058
She's in a better place.

703
00:42:09,282 --> 00:42:10,447
That's what they say.

704
00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:16,561
It's late and it's been a long day.

705
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:19,690
Okay.

706
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:23,354
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

707
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:26,233
Stephanie.

708
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,434
What happened?

709
00:43:08,144 --> 00:43:11,018
Somebody very important to me died.

710
00:43:16,142 --> 00:43:17,134
Who?

711
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:21,188
The only person in the
world who really knew me.

712
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:32,093
That's not true.

713
00:43:39,843 --> 00:43:40,927
You should go home.

714
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:44,645
You can come in late.

715
00:43:46,082 --> 00:43:47,030
I'll be fine.

716
00:43:49,177 --> 00:43:50,414
I'm so sorry.

717
00:43:56,144 --> 00:43:56,873
Good night.

718
00:44:36,765 --> 00:44:38,472
Drop and give me 20.

719
00:44:39,715 --> 00:44:40,799
You asshole.

720
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:43,811
Get to work. It's 10:30, maggot.

721
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:47,829
- Oh.
- Did you spend the night here?

722
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:51,004
- Yeah.
- See the fight?

723
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:52,709
No.

724
00:44:53,062 --> 00:44:55,238
90 seconds of boxing and
three hours of analysis.

725
00:44:55,522 --> 00:44:57,378
- And we still don't know who won.
- Clay won.

726
00:44:57,379 --> 00:44:58,284
Read the paper.

727
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:06,343
Come in.

728
00:45:11,235 --> 00:45:13,148
You look fresh. Did you go home?

729
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:16,306
I spruced up. Come over here.

730
00:45:19,176 --> 00:45:20,094
Look at this.

731
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,477
I think you have to know the photo.

732
00:45:29,283 --> 00:45:31,541
It's on the front page of
every paper. It's historic.

733
00:45:33,674 --> 00:45:35,833
How do we know it's the
tourister that got knocked out?

734
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:38,279
Because the slogan will say so.

735
00:45:39,205 --> 00:45:41,145
How do you put it on tv?
Are they animated?

736
00:45:41,987 --> 00:45:43,543
Why are you shitting on this?

737
00:45:45,335 --> 00:45:46,304
I'm tired.

738
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:48,608
It's good.

739
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,169
It's very good.

740
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:13,442
Give it to Joey... no, Stan...

741
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:16,398
Then go home, shower,

742
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:18,333
then come back and give me 10 tag lines.

743
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:18,941
Okay.

744
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:25,985
Open or closed?

745
00:46:27,028 --> 00:46:27,867
Open.

746
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:38,267
