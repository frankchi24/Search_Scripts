1
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,880
But the good news is
I think it's gonna be between us.

2
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:13,543
Bad news is the best
man is gonna win.

3
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,503
You can't even watch
them for a second!

4
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:17,119
It's like... Leaving
them with nobody!

5
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:18,384
Because you're so good with them.

6
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:19,479
What does your husband do?

7
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,104
I'm not married.

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,872
Don is important.

9
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:24,264
You know, I found that guy.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,455
I'm gonna hard on you,

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,271
only because I think
I see you as an

12
00:00:28,384 --> 00:00:29,544
extension of myself.

13

14
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:11,142
"Greyhound. The cure
for the common bus."

15
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,945
"Lay-z-boy. The cure
for the common chair."

16
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:18,049
"Budweiser. The cure
for the common beer."

17
00:01:19,452 --> 00:01:20,885
"Manufacturers Hanover bank.

18
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:24,389
The cure for the common... Bank."

19
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:28,526
How about "Alka-seltzer.
The cure for the common cold"?

20
00:01:28,594 --> 00:01:30,629
"The cure for the common cold"

21
00:01:30,696 --> 00:01:32,864
is the idiom I'm playing off.

22
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:35,267
It's an idiom.
Did you know that?

23
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:40,639
So other than your summer
internship at Needham,

24
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:42,474
do you have any actual
advertising experience?

25
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,909
The cure for the common chair.

26
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:46,511
That's Roger's favorite.

27
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,480
Roger Sterling.

28
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:51,016
He's the guy I shook hands with
when I came in.

29
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,485
What did Roger think of this ad?

30
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:55,620
What, are you kidding me?
Everybody loves that.

31
00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:57,822
It's the opposite
of what you expect.

32
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,391
That's what I'm interested in.

33
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:01,359
Why is it in your book?

34
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:02,627
I've got a bunch of them in there...

35
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:03,928
Marlboro man, Maidenform.

36
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:06,731
I like to put in work
that I admire.

37
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,067
Don't you ever tear things
out of magazines?

38
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:12,637
Yes, but I don't
put them in my book.

39
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:15,707
Well, you know what they say:

40
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,376
"Aspiration's as good
as perspiration."

41
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:20,078
That's not how it goes.

42
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:24,149
Look,

43
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:26,318
I'm a 24-year-old kid.

44
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:29,521
I want to be in the ad game.

45
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:32,390
I know I've got a lot to learn,
but I'm a hard worker.

46
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,826
I'd sweep up the floors around here.

47
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:36,728
I don't know if Roger told you that.

48
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:38,196
He did talk to you, didn't he?

49
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:39,864
He did.

50
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:43,735
It was really a pleasure
to meet you, Danny.

51
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,642
- I wish you the best of luck.
- Best of luck in... In what?

52
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,378
- What do you mean?
- You trailed off.

53
00:02:53,446 --> 00:02:54,779
We'll let you know.

54
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,815
Do you know a good place
to eat around here?

55
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:01,553
Tell my secretary you're hungry

56
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,222
and see what she suggests.

57
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:14,165
Are we on "Candid camera"?

58
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:17,469
I don't want to jump
on his grave or anything,

59
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:19,904
but there's no way he's 24.

60
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:22,507
I'm 25.

61
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:25,510
What's his connection to Roger?

62
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:27,579
Besides being delusional?

63
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,581
He's Jane Seigel's cousin.

64
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:33,184
It's a relief to see

65
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:35,954
someone worse than me
and really know it.

66
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:38,089
Don't get used to it.

67
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:41,860
Well, you know,
I look at Glo-coat

68
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:44,062
and see how far
everything's come...

69
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,830
You know, my work.

70
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:47,832
Glo-coat.

71
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,502
You finish something,
you find out everyone loves it

72
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,103
right around the time that

73
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:53,671
it feels like someone else did it.

74
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,942
Is that your speech for the Clios?

75
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,344
They don't have speeches.

76
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:01,713
We're going to win.

77
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,148
Just because it got nominated

78
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:04,682
doesn't mean they're going
to give me an award.

79
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,217
Aren't you excited?

80
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:07,919
I try not to think about it.

81
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:09,654
Then you must be excited.

82
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:12,490
Well, it'd be good for the agency.

83
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:16,628
Grey doubled their value in five years
and it was all based on awards.

84
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:19,931
You got anything on Vicks?

85
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,101
- Actually, it's Vick chemical.
- Answer the question.

86
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,403
We're very behind.

87
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,473
Your new art director has been
waiting for synchronicity,

88
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,942
which involves me coming up
with a bunch of ideas,

89
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,446
chasing him down and having him
draw all of them and lose them.

90
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:37,248
He's your new art director too,
and you have a deadline.

91
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:39,951
And don't think you can spend
Monday hiding behind corners

92
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,054
and trying not to make eye contact.
I will find you.

93
00:04:43,122 --> 00:04:45,790
- I'm not the problem.
- You are,

94
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:49,093
because Stan is talented
and more experienced.

95
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:52,096
You need to learn how to work
with him, not the other way around.

96
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:57,602
Well, good luck this afternoon.

97
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,671
You're not supposed to say that.

98
00:04:59,738 --> 00:05:02,073
Oh. Well, break a leg.

99
00:05:05,544 --> 00:05:07,579
Charlie Chaplin was very lonely.

100
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:10,181
That tramp...
Too much of a sad sack.

101
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:12,317
Laurel and Hardy...
They were better,

102
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:15,320
except Hardy was so mean to Laurel.
I hated that.

103
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,491
Why am I talking
about silent movies?

104
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:24,128
I suppose as part of the chapter
on your childhood?

105
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:26,197
That part of my book is
getting bigger and bigger.

106
00:05:26,265 --> 00:05:28,366
Why is that?

107
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:29,767
Who is it?

108
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:33,671
I thought I should come in
and tell you this in person.

109
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,573
That kid...
A very very cute prank.

110
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:37,575
Caroline... To be continued.

111
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:39,644
That's a good idea.

112
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:41,012
I've been to the Clios before.

113
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,814
We're gonna want
to show up prepared.

114
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:45,617
His book...

115
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:48,486
...It was filled with old ads.

116
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,388
Plagiarism... That's resourceful.

117
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:52,857
He had five originals...

118
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:55,793
- They were all the same thing.
- I told him to be himself.

119
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:58,129
That was pretty mean, I guess.

120
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:02,367
- So when does he start?
- The first of never.

121
00:06:03,903 --> 00:06:05,603
Well, you haven't
been married for a while,

122
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,338
so you've probably forgotten
how these transactions work.

123
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,173
If I don't hire Jane's cousin,

124
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,409
it's probably going to cost me
a personal gift expenditure

125
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,845
of between $500 and $1,000.

126
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,147
- When are we leaving?
- Right after life cereal.

127
00:06:16,215 --> 00:06:17,715
To new business...

128
00:06:19,451 --> 00:06:21,185
And victory at the Waldorf.

129
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:22,387
I mean it. You deserve it.

130
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,292
So I can show you what's popular,
what's unique,

131
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:29,060
and the only thing I ask
is that you call me Don.

132
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:32,230
Well, Don, I can't say
I know my furs that well.

133
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,098
I know my mother had
a chinchilla...

134
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,801
I was always on the verge
of a romantic relationship with it.

135
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:39,637
- Is this for your mother?
- I bet you never hear that.

136
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:43,141
I don't. Would you like
to give me a price range?

137
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,344
Well, that's an interesting question.
I have a unique problem.

138
00:06:46,412 --> 00:06:49,013
I need to spend a lot but
be careful not to spend too much.

139
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:51,849
Not a unique problem.
I don't want to be forward,

140
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:53,885
but can I assume this is
some kind of an apology?

141
00:06:53,953 --> 00:06:56,321
No no no, I know exactly
how much that costs.

142
00:06:56,388 --> 00:06:59,157
This is "I'm getting to know you,
but I don't want to scare you."

143
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:00,658
I know what we're gonna do.

144
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:02,694
So now it's "we"?

145
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,565
It's always the right size

146
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:10,134
and nothing says mink like mink.

147
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:12,403
It's a nice way to ease into things

148
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,305
and you can always come back
for the rest of it.

149
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:16,307
How about we split the difference
so they wear them to their waist?

150
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,076
It's the most popular this year.

151
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:23,615
"Why wait for a man
to buy you a fur coat?"

152
00:07:25,317 --> 00:07:28,186
That's a dumb question.
Who does your work?

153
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:29,954
- I do.
- Really?

154
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:33,191
Yeah. It's an interest of mine
and they let me do it.

155
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:38,796
Look at that.
Can I give you a call?

156
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:41,833
First of all, you need 20 of those.

157
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,801
And second of all, no.

158
00:07:43,869 --> 00:07:46,004
I just want you to call that number

159
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,639
so I can give you some
very specific delivery instructions.

160
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,508
Of course, Mr. Sterling.

161
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:54,045
So what do I owe you?

162
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:57,015
I saw you leave the office
with something under your arm.

163
00:07:57,082 --> 00:08:00,051
You don't know what it is.

164
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,520
The guy in the elevator
thought it was a hydrogen bomb.

165
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:05,690
- It's a beautiful box.
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:07,692
Skip the radio play. Open it.

167
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:17,168
Oh, Roger, you shouldn't have.

168
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:18,970
You like it?

169
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:20,838
I don't know what to say.

170
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:21,973
Try it on.

171
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,077
But first take off the dress.

172
00:08:26,145 --> 00:08:28,513
One gift at a time.

173
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,717
What is this, an owner's manual?

174
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:38,756
It's Noah's ark.

175
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,461
It's out of line is what it is.

176
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:47,398
So?

177
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,804
I love it. It's perfect.

178
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:55,707
And I think it's a bit much.

179
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:58,576
If you don't kiss me after that,
I'm gonna believe you.

180
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:10,288
When I wear it, I'll think of everything
that happened the night I got it.

181
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,567
Caroline!

182
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:25,169
Get in here. I think I finally
have a work story.

183
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:30,975
Joan! What's keeping them?

184
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:34,479
Life.

185
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:36,647
When do you have to
leave for the clios?

186
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:37,982
I was late for
the Emmys last year.

187
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,084
Red Skelton gave my seat away.

188
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:42,286
I would surmise, due to the usual
nature of your stories,

189
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:44,088
that that's someone of note.

190
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:48,359
The good news is our friends
at the cereal company

191
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:50,161
have been grounded
in Philly due to wind.

192
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,930
- What's good about that?
- And the bad news is...

193
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,769
We only have an hour before
we're due at the Clios.

194
00:09:57,836 --> 00:10:01,205
Sorry, kids.
Game called on account of wind.

195
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:03,474
Well, if it's all about a sendoff,
I'll have a 7&7.

196
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,410
You have legs. Don?

197
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:08,646
Make it simple but significant.

198
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:11,082
It's Friday.

199
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,050
For all we know, they're going to
turn around and go home

200
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:16,387
- and we'll have to reschedule.
- Is Joan going with you?

201
00:10:16,455 --> 00:10:19,323
Yes. We only had four tickets.

202
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:20,925
There'll be a lot of other
people's clients there.

203
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:24,595
- Thank you, Joan.
- Peggy, anything?

204
00:10:24,663 --> 00:10:26,464
I have work to do.

205
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:33,471
"We represent the majority
of the people in Alabama

206
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,940
who hate niggerism, catholicism,

207
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:38,509
judaism and all the isms
in the whole world."

208
00:10:38,577 --> 00:10:41,212
So said Robert Creel
of the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.

209
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,747
Somebody got it to Goldwater.

210
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,916
Apparently he pissed blood.

211
00:10:44,983 --> 00:10:46,450
"...Needs our help."

212
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:51,989
This again? Really?

213
00:10:52,057 --> 00:10:54,625
Clara asked.

214
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:56,694
Clara asked to see your reel?

215
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:59,430
I just wanted to see that Klan one.

216
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:02,934
- He said it never aired.
- Which makes it less impressive, Clara.

217
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,335
Girls, do you mind?

218
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:23,721
Well, all the girls are gone.
What do you want?

219
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:25,890
Are you going to use the K.K.K.
to sell cough drops?

220
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,358
It's better than waiting on you

221
00:11:27,426 --> 00:11:29,126
to bring me something
that'll get my juices flowing.

222
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:32,296
Should I get Megan back in here?
Maybe she's not repressed.

223
00:11:32,364 --> 00:11:36,200
Why's it so hard for you to accept
that man's natural state is nude?

224
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:38,736
- Because I'm civilized.
- Because you're brainwashed

225
00:11:38,804 --> 00:11:41,172
by society into thinking it's dirty.

226
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,041
You take away all this crap
and you'd see it's not.

227
00:11:44,109 --> 00:11:46,010
It's natural and it's beautiful.

228
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:48,212
Have you been yelled at
by Don yet?

229
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,415
- I'm not scared of him.
- So that's a no.

230
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:53,384
He said Monday...
And I'm not working this weekend.

231
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:56,587
Okay okay. Jesus.
Are you on the rag?

232
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,024
It'll get done. Let's go.

233
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:06,731
Well, I'd say you're lucky
the Glo-coat brass isn't here.

234
00:12:06,798 --> 00:12:09,367
The minute you win they know
the ad's arty, then you're out of business.

235
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:11,702
Turns out there's almost 50 awards.

236
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,171
Let's say 10 minutes a piece, it's...

237
00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:15,573
Holy crap.

238
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,541
Roger, you remember
Ned Elliot from K&E.

239
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:19,010
Of course. What are you in for?

240
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:20,778
New England Merchants Bank,

241
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:22,613
best local under $2,000.

242
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:24,982
Stop bragging, will you?

243
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,684
Good luck, Don.

244
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:32,223
Well well, if it isn't
Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm.

245
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,625
Leave any drinks
for the rest of us?

246
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:37,695
Don Draper, Roger Sterling,
this is major-general Frank Alvin.

247
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,699
Roger, have you had the pleasure
of meeting Ted Chaough?

248
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,902
Is that how you say it?
C-h-a-o-u-g-h?

249
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,904
Hey, writers, how many
extra vowels is that?

250
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,974
Let's head due south, General.

251
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,842
Well, I hope this doesn't
drag on like last year.

252
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,577
Oh, wait. You weren't here.

253
00:12:57,716 --> 00:12:59,750
General Rufus T. Bullshit.

254
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,852
I've met that guy before.

255
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,689
- In the war?
- No, in a commercial for Bay rum.

256
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:07,591
Chao-guh-guh hired
an actor to impress someone.

257
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,460
Last time I saw the General,
he had a parrot on his shoulder.

258
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,231
That was not a business proposition.

259
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,968
You catch more flies with honey.

260
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:20,471
Oh, great...
Actual flies.

261
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:24,642
Phillip, how are you?

262
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,944
- You remember Joan Harris.
- Nice to see you.

263
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,679
Mr. Cosgrove,
nice to see you again.

264
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,414
I'm surprised he would
bring you over here.

265
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:32,416
You know, we miss birds-eye
more than we miss Kenny.

266
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:35,052
Well, that's why
I wanted to say hello.

267
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,687
I hear the old team's
getting back together.

268
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,322
What team?

269
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,525
Uh, Phil, that's not a sure thing.

270
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:47,598
Well, I'll say this about Guyer...

271
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,900
- They don't have Don.
- Take your seats, please.

272
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,636
Well, we should sit down. Good luck.

273
00:13:55,474 --> 00:13:57,908
Judas priest.
Are we merging with Guyer?

274
00:13:57,976 --> 00:13:59,677
Talk to Lane.

275
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:07,184
Welcome to the sixth annual
American television commercials awards.

276
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:10,654
We're here to honor
creative excellence

277
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,089
in advertising and design...

278
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:15,159
I just ran into Ken Cosgrove.

279
00:14:15,227 --> 00:14:17,395
Don't talk to me right now.

280
00:14:17,462 --> 00:14:19,830
And I do mean everything.

281
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:25,536
I don't know if it was
that funny, but thank you.

282
00:14:25,604 --> 00:14:29,140
I have to tell you I am very
impressed you got this gig.

283
00:14:29,207 --> 00:14:32,910
Yes. Well, thank you
for making it easier.

284
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:34,812
Wally, it's me.

285
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:39,950
You know, when I was
coming up at Y&R,

286
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:43,020
you were very inspiring.

287
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:45,656
Raymond Rubicam said
you were a genius.

288
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,591
Great to see you...

289
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,860
I mean, actually alive and everything.

290
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:52,797
Get your hands off me.

291
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:55,433
What's with the French service?

292
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,501
God, I miss working with that guy.

293
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:00,471
I feel like I've already won.

294
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,772
Well, I'm afraid that'll be the limit

295
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,108
to the public speaking
portion of our show.

296
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:08,212
And, gentlemen,
let's pace ourselves.

297
00:15:10,782 --> 00:15:13,284
In the first category...
That of apparel...

298
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:15,019
The nominees are...

299
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:20,658
Hey, that's five.

300
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:22,726
If you really worked
on the Johnson campaign,

301
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:25,029
- why are you here?
- Because nobody at D.D.B.

302
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:27,098
Even keeps track
of who does what...

303
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:30,801
Except "the Daisy ad". Big deal.

304
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:33,704
The Klan is probably the best thing
I'll be near my entire life.

305
00:15:33,772 --> 00:15:35,673
Well, let me tell you...

306
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,241
I had a lot to do with Glo-coat...

307
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:39,910
A lot... The idea especially.

308
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:42,146
The kid?

309
00:15:42,214 --> 00:15:44,748
Don put the whole
cowboy thing on it.

310
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,684
I don't know if it was
that revolutionary.

311
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:50,554
It was jarring,
but more cute than I like.

312
00:15:50,622 --> 00:15:52,523
I know I'm not supposed to go,

313
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:55,559
but when the nomination came in,

314
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:57,761
Don let everybody
pat him on the back.

315
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:00,231
He didn't even look at me

316
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:02,099
and I was... I was right there.

317
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:06,604
I was clapping and he thought
I was clapping for him.

318
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:08,472
Who claps for themselves?

319
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:15,079
Okay, I'm gonna riff
for a few minutes

320
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:19,517
and just sorta speechatize
the whole Vicks experience.

321
00:16:19,584 --> 00:16:21,185
Should I come back
when you're through?

322
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:23,287
No, toots, grab a pencil.

323
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,389
Someone's gonna want
to get it down

324
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:27,291
before it heads
into the stratosphere.

325
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:29,193
Why don't you
write down my ideas?

326
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:30,861
Look, I read your brochure.

327
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:33,197
I have no interest
in the temperance movement.

328
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:38,135
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

329
00:16:46,444 --> 00:16:49,813
And now for best cleansers,
waxes and polishes.

330
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:52,750
- This is us.
- Glass wax spray's

331
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:56,587
"gobbles up dirt,"
Campbell Mithun of Minneapolis.

332
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:58,389
How do I look?

333
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:00,724
- Great.
- One step floor care's

334
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,661
"bus stop," B.B.D.O.;

335
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:06,330
Glo-coat,  "Billy the kid,"

336
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:08,933
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce;

337
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,803
and pledge, "Runaway chair,"
Benton & Bowles.

338
00:17:14,973 --> 00:17:17,575
And the winner is...

339
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:19,510
Glo-coat, "Billy the kid"...

340
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:23,113
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

341
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:32,923
- Congratulations, Don.
- Thank you.

342
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,178
- Next up, competing in...
- Let me see it.

343
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:56,880
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

344
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:59,049
- What's going on, dear?
- Well, I ran over

345
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:01,318
because the people from
life cereal rented a car

346
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:03,087
and now they're waiting
at the office.

347
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:05,356
- Right now?
- We'll reschedule.

348
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:07,191
Maybe I can convince them
to stay for the weekend.

349
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:09,560
No no, they want
to see our presentation.

350
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:11,662
What do you say we put
a cherry on this thing?

351
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,064
- Aye aye, sir.
- Really?

352
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,976
So the Schusters move into what
used to be the Harrington House.

353
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:22,278
Meanwhile, Betty gets
extremely jealous

354
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:24,680
when she sees Allison dancing
with Rodney at the after-party.

355
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:26,749
But then Michael asked
Betty to dance with him

356
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:28,584
and also dances with Claire

357
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:31,854
and that is all I can tell you about
the next few weeks of "Peyton place."

358
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:33,489
How the heck do
you know all this?

359
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:35,224
They send me the scripts.

360
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,727
I need to see them. It's my job.

361
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:39,762
I can't believe Connie goes
through with their wedding.

362
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,031
It is a surprise. I agree.

363
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:49,739
What more do I need to say?

364
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:52,375
- It's heavy.
- Don, you remember...

365
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:54,510
Jim and Dennis,
glad you could make it.

366
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:56,679
I can't thank you
enough for waiting.

367
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:59,482
Oh, don't think about it.
I've been unwinding

368
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,784
as Mr. Crane ruins
"Peyton place" for us.

369
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:04,487
Perfect. Let's get to it.

370
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:06,722
- Roger, thank you.
- I'll be on my way,

371
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,058
but first... Victory lap!

372
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:11,327
Come on, Don, Pete,
Crane, Jimmy Olsen!

373
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:20,970
Wrap it up quickly, gents.
We have an after-party to attend.

374
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:22,738
Thank you, Roger.

375
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,307
Is everyone set?

376
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:26,209
That's one word for it.

377
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:28,144
Joey, you didn't start
without me, did you?

378
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:29,812
No, Don. I would not do that.

379
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,348
Okay, everybody ready?

380
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:35,651
So...

381
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:40,256
Life cereal... Delicious, crispy

382
00:19:40,324 --> 00:19:41,691
and it's got a big name, you know.

383
00:19:41,758 --> 00:19:43,192
And I know you want
to associate it with health,

384
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,694
but that's not fun. Joey?

385
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:47,597
Ah. You know what?
I've got it.

386
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:52,235
Look, there are
sweeter cereals than this,

387
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:54,670
but I kept thinking about, you know,

388
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:57,173
nostalgia.

389
00:19:57,241 --> 00:19:59,242
How you remember
something in the past

390
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:02,478
and it feels good,
but it's a little bit painful,

391
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:04,380
like when you were a kid.

392
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:05,982
- That's the truth.
- And "Life,"

393
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,417
that's a scary word
to anyone at any age.

394
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:09,385
So how do we make it fun?

395
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:14,590
"Eat life by the bowlful."

396
00:20:14,658 --> 00:20:16,859
A little kid, big bowl, big spoon.

397
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:19,729
Kids see the giant bowl
of cereal and they smile

398
00:20:19,796 --> 00:20:22,298
because, you know, they'd eat
a box of it if they could.

399
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,433
And moms see it
and they get this twinge

400
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,835
of how little their kid still is

401
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:27,970
even though they have
to deal with life.

402
00:20:28,038 --> 00:20:29,839
Get those two together
in a market

403
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,140
and I think we're going
to sell some cereal.

404
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,243
That's all I have.

405
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:36,679
I think if you'd invite us into the rest
of your company,

406
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:38,447
we could build
a Saturday morning tv show

407
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:39,949
around the whole
Quaker oats family.

408
00:20:40,017 --> 00:20:41,951
In fact, it could be called
the "Quaker oats family."

409
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:45,121
I like the bowlful,

410
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:48,357
but I think it's kinda smart
for regular folks, you know?

411
00:20:48,425 --> 00:20:51,294
- The irony, I guess.
- Children look at the picture.

412
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:53,496
Moms look at the irony.

413
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:56,098
Yeah, but when
I go back to Chicago,

414
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,267
all they're gonna wanna hear
is a slogan,

415
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:00,903
and I don't think this is gonna cut it.

416
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:04,040
Well, why don't we let
Don work that over?

417
00:21:04,107 --> 00:21:06,108
We can either talk on Monday
if you're staying the weekend

418
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:07,376
or we can come
see you in Chicago.

419
00:21:07,444 --> 00:21:08,577
I've got it. I've got it, Pete.

420
00:21:11,581 --> 00:21:13,582
How about...

421
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,751
"Life is just a bowl of life cereal"?

422
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:20,156
"Life is sweet."

423
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:23,659
Uh...

424
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:26,095
"Enjoy the rest of your life... Cereal"

425
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:28,464
Don, they're not expecting
you to do this right now.

426
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:30,499
Give me a second.

427
00:21:30,567 --> 00:21:33,202
"Life. The reason to get
out of bed in the morning."

428
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,972
"Life. The cure
for the common breakfast."

429
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,407
"Life. It's sweetness
never ends."

430
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:41,577
- "Life. Eat it by the bowlful."
- Oh oh. There you go.

431
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:44,714
"The cure for the common breakfast."

432
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:47,683
- Love it.
- It's got the health angle.

433
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:49,685
Life makes you feel better.

434
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:52,388
It's got protein.
Very nice.

435
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:55,658
- That dog will hunt.
- Wonderful.

436
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:58,494
- We'll get that put together for you.
- Should we discuss media?

437
00:21:58,562 --> 00:22:01,297
- I can keep going.
-  think we've got a home run.

438
00:22:01,365 --> 00:22:04,734
We don't need to take up
any more of your time.

439
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:07,203
I know you have
some celebrating to do.

440
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,673
I don't know what to say. This is
the most fun I've ever had in New York.

441
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:15,111
- Anytime, fellas.
- Very good then.

442
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:18,280
Roger, I'm done!

443
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:20,583
- Let's go!
- Can I speak with you a moment?

444
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,586
- Got anything on Vicks yet?
- I really need to talk to you.

445
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:26,022
- You still have nothing?
- The tagline...

446
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:27,690
Do you think I'm joking when
I give you a deadline?

447
00:22:27,758 --> 00:22:30,092
- You said Monday.
- Ida, book a nice room with a lock on it

448
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,062
for misters Olsen and Rizzo.
Bill it to Vicks.

449
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,964
- Don't come out until you have something.
- Are you kidding?

450
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:38,567
Pete, we'll walk 'em out.

451
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:44,673
Do you want to pick
a place or should I?

452
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:47,376
He wasn't serious. It's the weekend.
We'll work in the office.

453
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:50,346
Do you want me to go chase him
down to see if he's serious or not?

454
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:52,348
Go get Stanley.

455
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:59,889
- I need to speak with you.
- Not now.

456
00:22:59,956 --> 00:23:02,024
- Lane, may I?
- Come in.

457
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,298
I'm only going to ask once:

458
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:10,800
Are we merging with guyer?

459
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:13,169
- No.
- Really?

460
00:23:13,236 --> 00:23:16,906
Well, I ran into Ken Cosgrove and
Clarence Birdseye at the Clios.

461
00:23:21,478 --> 00:23:25,081
It came to me that
Mr. Cosgrove was unhappy

462
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:28,284
and that he and his choice clients

463
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:30,686
would be a welcome
addition to the firm.

464
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:32,021
Over my dead body.

465
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:40,996
I apologize. It was wrong of me
not to consult you.

466
00:23:41,064 --> 00:23:43,466
- I wasn't sure...
- Wasn't sure about what?

467
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:45,568
Whether to go behind my back?

468
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:48,804
I'm a partner, damn it. I have
the same status here as you.

469
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:52,208
You've never liked me.

470
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:53,843
You picked him
over me to begin with

471
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,744
and now you expect me
to work with him again?

472
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:57,179
Approval denied.

473
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,319
Roger Sterling is a child,

474
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:05,354
and frankly

475
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:08,090
we can't have you pulling
the cart all by yourself.

476
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:13,295
Ken is proven,

477
00:24:13,363 --> 00:24:15,831
he's hungry,

478
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:18,000
and he has accounts.

479
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:21,403
Birds-eye, a beverage
called mountain dew

480
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:22,771
and Fillmore auto parts,

481
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,507
which has entered
the national arena.

482
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:27,977
He would more
than pay for himself.

483
00:24:28,044 --> 00:24:29,745
Does that put you at ease?

484
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:31,680
What would put me at ease

485
00:24:31,748 --> 00:24:34,316
is you and Madame Defarge
not plotting behind my back.

486
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,853
Still, I expect pragmatism from you.

487
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:41,123
We share that.

488
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:45,261
Mr. Cosgrove and I are
having lunch on Monday.

489
00:24:45,328 --> 00:24:48,397
If your tantrum has subsided,

490
00:24:48,465 --> 00:24:50,900
you're welcome to join us.

491
00:24:53,003 --> 00:24:55,104
- I'm going home.
- And on a personal note,

492
00:24:55,172 --> 00:24:57,640
I'd like to add that
I'm quite fond of you.

493
00:24:57,707 --> 00:25:00,209
It pains me to hear
you say otherwise.

494
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:07,850
- Get that thing in here.
- Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

495
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:13,088
Mmm! General.

496
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:16,458
You're not flying tonight, are you?

497
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:18,127
No, it's been years.

498
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:21,030
Ah. I bet. Name some aircraft for me.

499
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:23,799
- No.
- No, wait. Who do you report to?

500
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:26,902
- The President.
- Of what, William Morris?

501
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,572
You know, one of these decorations

502
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:31,907
is for shutting up loudmouths.

503
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:34,109
It's a pleasure to meet you, General.
Enjoy your evening.

504
00:25:38,882 --> 00:25:41,717
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

505
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:44,386
- You too.
- We're the top of the heap, huh?

506
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:47,923
- The heap of what?
- I know they give out 50 a year,

507
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:50,226
but I've gotta say it doesn't get
any sweeter than this.

508
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:53,629
Roger, buy Ned a drink.

509
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:58,334
There you are.

510
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:01,170
Your mom called.
She's looking for us.

511
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:04,106
It was very nice meeting you.

512
00:26:04,174 --> 00:26:06,108
- What are you doing?
- Rescuing you.

513
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:09,411
From what, a business opportunity?

514
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,914
Did you see the part
where I won?

515
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:14,350
No, but I heard about it.

516
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:17,586
They're gonna put your picture
on a dartboard at Grey.

517
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:19,888
What is your problem?

518
00:26:19,956 --> 00:26:21,624
Grey won. Everybody won.

519
00:26:21,691 --> 00:26:23,659
That's not true.

520
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:26,061
Just think how you'd feel
right now if you lost.

521
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:28,631
About the same, I suppose.

522
00:26:28,698 --> 00:26:30,566
It doesn't make the work any better.

523
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:33,469
That's very healthy.

524
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:37,039
Award or no award,
you're still Don Draper.

525
00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:38,874
Whatever that means.

526
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:42,077
You're incredible.

527
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:49,251
You smell good.

528
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,086
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

529
00:26:54,524 --> 00:26:56,392
What do you say we get out of here

530
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:58,794
and really celebrate?

531
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:05,267
I think you're confusing
a lot of things at once right now.

532
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:13,342
I'm very happy for you.

533
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,914
Are you calling
to give him an update?

534
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,517
I'm calling him about something
completely unrelated to you.

535
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:35,353
I know you have
a special relationship.

536
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:39,257
- What does that mean?
- What?

537
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,360
Not that. Jesus.
Of course not that.

538
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:43,962
Do you think he'd be
caught dead with you?

539
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,463
There's wallpaper more exciting.

540
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,599
But I know you're his favorite.

541
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,734
I bet he takes you hunting

542
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,636
and lets you carry the carcasses
in your mouth.

543
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:55,473
Are you gonna work
or just stare at pictures

544
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,941
of women who can't stare back?

545
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:00,311
You wouldn't understand,

546
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,615
but this inspires me,

547
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:06,618
opens my mind with freedom.

548
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,021
So why aren't you a nudist?

549
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,824
You talk about it all the time.

550
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:16,094
Well, in a liberated
environment, I would be.

551
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:18,530
In the presence of the Pope

552
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:20,598
or say, you,

553
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,135
it's difficult.

554
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,137
You don't know anything about me.

555
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:29,007
I know you're ashamed
of your body

556
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,408
or you should be at least.

557
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,658
- What are you doing?
- You're lazy.

558
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,593
And you have no ideas.

559
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:54,899
- Really?
- Yeah. Let's go.

560
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,803
You're a fruitcake, you know that?

561
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,905
And you're chickenshit.

562
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,974
I can work like this.
Let's get liberated.

563
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,311
Fantastic.

564
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:38,877
What are you waiting for?

565
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,646
Just...

566
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:49,320
Let's talk cough drops.
Whatcha got?

567
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,956
I'm thinking.

568
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,758
About what?

569
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:56,494
Don't flatter yourself.
It's involuntary.

570
00:29:56,562 --> 00:30:00,231
Maybe it was left over
from the magazine.

571
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,967
Terrific.

572
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:05,503
Now I don't think it's that
hard to convince people

573
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:08,273
that cough drops are medicine,
especially when they taste like it, right?

574
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:23,822
So you're really gonna leave me alone
with all these naked gold women?

575
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,758
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt.

576
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,327
- You're not interrupting.
- That man over there...

577
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,729
I saw you talking before.

578
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:34,499
- Is that Don Draper?
- Yes it is.

579
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,769
- Is he attached?
- To that glass? Absolutely.

580
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,871
No.

581
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,778
He's pretty proud of himself.

582
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,947
Well, it's a big day for him.

583
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,548
It's a big day for all of us.

584
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:54,118
Especially you, okay?

585
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,622
Well, they don't seem
to give awards for what I do.

586
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,657
And what is that?

587
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,061
Find guys like him.

588
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:10,068
You've crossed the border
from lubricated to morose.

589
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,071
Good night.

590
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,684
Mr. Sterling.

591
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,223
- Do I know you?
- It's Don.

592
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:35,693
Don Draper. Heller's luxury furs.

593
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,562
Oh, the fur guy.

594
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,466
- What are you doing here?
- I have a meeting in the building.

595
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,268
I saw you standing here
and I thought I'd say hello.

596
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,639
Really? Name one other
company in this building.

597
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,810
I'm sorry. It's just...

598
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,480
I've left some messages for you.

599
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,383
And I've ignored them.
That's my message for you.

600
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,652
I just wanted to know
what you thought of my portfolio.

601
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:03,321
I threw it out
with the box from the coat.

602
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:04,789
That was a bad idea.

603
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:08,426
Maybe it was a bad idea,

604
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:11,329
but weren't you trying
to get a break once?

605
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,202
Where does your boss
think you are right now?

606
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,440
He knows I want to do what you do.

607
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:24,375
And what do you think that is?

608
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,879
I think you're a very important man
in a very important agency.

609
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,515
Maybe I am risking my job,

610
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,284
but I'd do anything to buy you a drink

611
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:34,519
and hear anything you have to say.

612
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,388
It's 10:00 A.M.

613
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,691
My mother always said

614
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,993
"be careful what you wish for,
because you'll get it.

615
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,662
And then people'll get jealous and
try to take it away from you."

616
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,699
I don't think that's how that goes.

617
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,301
You're an expert
on everything, right?

618
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,971
And how can I hire you?
You know too much about me.

619
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,839
You know I've been discreet.

620
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:57,508
Once you say that,
you're not discreet anymore.

621
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,411
I gotta get out of here before they
open for lunch. This is embarrassing.

622
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,348
I'll buy you lunch.

623
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,516
I'm stuffed. I had a jar of olives.

624
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,620
Oh.

625
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,991
And you're a great fur guy.

626
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,392
I'm gonna need one of those.

627
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,961
Let me get you a cab.

628
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,163
You should go home.

629
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,667
Garçon! Je m'appelle Roger!

630
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,302
Je suis un taxi, si vous plait!

631
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,779
So you use cough drops
when you're sick in bed,

632
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,081
on a car trip, at the movies

633
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,983
and in church.

634
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:41,586
Anything you'd like to add?

635
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,723
- What?
- This pencil's a little dull.

636
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:50,228
Maybe I should dip that thing
in some ink and write with it.

637
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:53,564
- Stop looking.
- I thought it might make it go away.

638
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:09,213
You know what? Fine.

639
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,484
Are we getting dressed now?

640
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,520
You can do whatever you want.

641
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,723
- I don't care.
- But you do.

642
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:22,026
- Fine, you win.
- Win what?

643
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:25,730
Win the prize for the
smuggest bitch in the world.

644
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,465
I need to take a leak.

645
00:34:39,344 --> 00:34:42,280
Hey, Rizzo!

646
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,582
I'm hungry.
Do you want anything?

647
00:34:56,088 --> 00:34:57,455
What did you win for again?

648
00:34:59,157 --> 00:35:01,158
Cake mixes and toppings.

649
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,427
I wrote the jingle.

650
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:06,163
Oh. Can you hum a few bars?

651
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,049
That sounds familiar.

652
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:31,188
Oh. Okay.

653
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:55,980
Hello.

654
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:58,048
So you finally decided
to pick up the phone?

655
00:35:58,116 --> 00:36:00,384
- Where the hell are you?
- Who is this?

656
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:03,387
It's me. Where the hell
are you? It's noon.

657
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:06,457
You were supposed
to be here two hours ago.

658
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:08,526
The kids are sitting
in the den watching tv,

659
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:10,728
waiting for someone who
is obviously not coming.

660
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:12,663
I know you don't care that Henry
and I were supposed to go

661
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:14,665
to a very important brunch,

662
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,534
but I can't get Carla anymore.
She's in church.

663
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:19,370
- I'm coming on Sunday.
- It is Sunday!

664
00:36:24,709 --> 00:36:28,012
I'm really sorry, Betts.
I'm under the weather.

665
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,047
Well, thank you for the notice, Don.
Thanks a lot.

666
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:34,818
Is everything okay?

667
00:36:36,254 --> 00:36:38,322
Yeah.

668
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,224
Everything's fine.

669
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:42,059
Ah.

670
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:44,595
I can't believe we slept so long.

671
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:47,598
Mmm. Mmm.

672
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,701
Is that yours?

673
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:53,837
No, it's yours.

674
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,245
I'm...

675
00:37:01,313 --> 00:37:03,280
Really sorry.

676
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:07,084
I have some things to do.
I forgot about them.

677
00:37:07,152 --> 00:37:09,687
You said you were gonna take
my picture and you never did.

678
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:14,491
- When did I say that?
- I don't know.

679
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:17,628
Somewhere around
your third order of French fries

680
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,163
after your sister left.

681
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:20,864
My sister?

682
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:24,702
Was that her on the phone?

683
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:27,504
- No.
- Don't lie to me. It's okay, Dick.

684
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:31,842
Listen, I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

685
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:39,883
Look,

686
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:43,454
I'm really late.

687
00:37:43,521 --> 00:37:46,757
- I should get ready.
- Oh, okay.

688
00:37:48,426 --> 00:37:50,394
Uh, do you mind?

689
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:58,969
I had a great time, Doris.

690
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:02,973
I'm really sorry I forgot I had plans.

691
00:38:25,196 --> 00:38:26,730
All right.

692
00:38:26,798 --> 00:38:28,632
I'll see you around, I guess.

693
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:21,652
Are you okay?

694
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,954
I tried to call you Friday night,

695
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:26,423
yesterday it rang and rang
and today it's busy.

696
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,392
My phone's not working.

697
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:30,861
Can I come in?

698
00:39:38,703 --> 00:39:40,604
What's the problem?

699
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,873
Uh...

700
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:44,608
I know you don't want to hear this,

701
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,411
but the life cereal tag you sold,

702
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:49,747
it was that kid's... Roger's idiot.

703
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:55,786
"Eat life by the bowlful"?
We worked on that for weeks.

704
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:58,722
No, "the cure for
the common breakfast."

705
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,990
You changed it in the meeting.

706
00:40:00,058 --> 00:40:02,459
I don't think so.

707
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:05,028
I know I've gotten stuff
stuck in my brain before

708
00:40:05,096 --> 00:40:06,997
and you don't know where
it's coming from.

709
00:40:07,065 --> 00:40:08,966
It's that kid's.

710
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:10,834
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

711
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:15,172
Call Life and tell them it's terrible

712
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,141
- and we changed our minds.
- They loved it.

713
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,810
- It's terrible.
- Well, neither you nor the client was

714
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,578
in a condition to notice.

715
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:26,383
Think of ten more tags.

716
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:29,453
No. I've been working
all weekend with that pig

717
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:31,755
in that stupid hotel room.
I am tapped out.

718
00:40:31,823 --> 00:40:34,391
What hotel room?

719
00:40:37,462 --> 00:40:40,431
You have to bring
him in right away.

720
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:43,066
Tomorrow. Fix it.

721
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:48,105
Shit.

722
00:41:03,697 --> 00:41:06,299
Mr. Cosgrove is on his way over.

723
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:07,800
I've added you to our reservation.

724
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,369
No. When he gets here

725
00:41:09,436 --> 00:41:10,870
bring him to the conference room.

726
00:41:17,077 --> 00:41:19,679
And he's coughing and
everyone's staring at him,

727
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:22,281
including the priest,
then he sucks on a vicks.

728
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,317
- It's good.
- Mmm.

729
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:26,886
- It's pretty much how I pitched it.
- That's true.

730
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:28,655
I only changed one little thing.

731
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:39,599
- Good morning.
- Call the Pen & Pencil,

732
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,434
see if someone found my award.

733
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,569
What's the category?

734
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:46,806
Best actress. It's a Clio.

735
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:57,617
Hey. They told me to wait here.

736
00:41:57,685 --> 00:41:59,385
Your little friend is waiting.

737
00:42:03,957 --> 00:42:05,258
Listen, Danny,

738
00:42:07,594 --> 00:42:10,329
I've been thinking about things and
there was a slogan in your book...

739
00:42:10,397 --> 00:42:13,599
"The cure for the common" something.

740
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,401
Bus, beer, chair?
Which one?

741
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,136
All of them.

742
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,871
I'm gonna give you $50 for the idea.

743
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:21,107
You liked it, huh?

744
00:42:21,175 --> 00:42:22,775
What did I just say?

745
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:25,578
I'd like a job.

746
00:42:28,415 --> 00:42:31,350
Fine, $100. It'll be freelance work.
Do you know what that is?

747
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:33,619
Yeah, it's not a job.

748
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:36,089
I don't have to buy it.

749
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:39,058
I could just use it. Take the money.

750
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:42,261
I don't need money. I need a job.

751
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:45,131
You wouldn't even be in this room
if you weren't related to Roger.

752
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,166
But I am. It's all I have...

753
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:50,403
That and my ideas.

754
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,317
This place is fantastic.

755
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:07,053
Lane, could you leave us please?

756
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:10,556
Certainly.

757
00:43:26,507 --> 00:43:28,541
I've given this a lot of thought.

758
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:30,409
Me too.

759
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:33,012
If you're open to the direction

760
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,114
and tenor of the business
I'm doing here,

761
00:43:35,182 --> 00:43:38,284
I think you'd be
a great addition to my team.

762
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:40,119
How's that supposed to mean?

763
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:43,556
That things have changed
in a permanent way.

764
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,093
I'd say nothing's changed.

765
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:50,897
Look, Ken,

766
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:52,999
everyone here likes you,

767
00:43:53,066 --> 00:43:55,401
but this is a small shop

768
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,403
and I need to know
you can do as told.

769
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:16,789
So...

770
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,426
How are the wedding plans coming?

771
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:23,596
Peggy!

772
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:29,969
Take Danny over to Joan.
He's starting next Monday.

773
00:44:30,037 --> 00:44:31,604
Are you kidding?

774
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:35,508
You will not be sorry.

775
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:36,909
Go away.

776
00:44:44,585 --> 00:44:46,452
Wait here.

777
00:44:54,428 --> 00:44:58,331
I always liked chocolate ice cream,
but my mother made us eat vanilla

778
00:44:58,398 --> 00:44:59,799
because it didn't stain anything.

779
00:45:02,636 --> 00:45:05,471
- I hired Jane's cousin.
- Really?

780
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,206
What changed your mind?

781
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:09,742
Couldn't live without him.

782
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:12,712
Well...

783
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:16,182
One good turn deserves another.

784
00:45:20,988 --> 00:45:23,189
You left it at the bar.

785
00:45:23,257 --> 00:45:25,491
Too much celebrating, I guess.

786
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:27,793
Yeah, that happens.

787
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:30,630
I'll give it back
if you just say one thing:

788
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:33,266
You couldn't have
done it without me.

00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,767
Did I not say that?

790
00:45:36,837 --> 00:45:38,337
I was wrong.

791
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,177
Thank you.

00:45:59,026 --> 00:46:00,760
Mr. Sterling.

793
00:46:00,827 --> 00:46:03,796
- Good morning.
- Jesus. Would you leave me alone?

794
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:05,798
You told me to come in.

795
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:09,835
- The hell I did.
- You hired me.

796
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:12,204
What? When?

797
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:15,474
Yesterday. You said,
"welcome aboard."
