1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,127
I wanna marry you.

2
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:08,903
Last season on AMC's Mad men...

3
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,192
Well, ho-ho.
Now it's the time.

4
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:12,967
Gentlemen, Jai Alai.

5
00:00:13,216 --> 00:00:14,943
I made an appointment with
the divorce attorney.

6
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:17,023
Forget it. I'm not gonna let
you break up this family.

7
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:18,424
I didn't break up this family.

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,535
P.P.L. is being sold and us along with it.

9
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:22,239
- Fire us.
- Why would I?

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:23,598
We'll make you a partner.

11
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:25,591
- Who the hell is Henry Francis?
- No one.

12
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,167
You're a whore!

13
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,455
Pete, we're starting a new agency.

14
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:34,032
We're here to talk to you
about joining us.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,559
Henry, I have three children.

16
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,088
I don't want you owing them anything.

17
00:00:37,407 --> 00:00:38,846
I want you to know that
I'm not gonna fight you.

18
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:41,687
Thank you. Goodbye.

19
00:00:41,903 --> 00:00:43,439
Mommy, she's not Margaret,
she's Jane.

20
00:00:43,638 --> 00:00:44,655
She's my wife.

21
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:46,381
I need you to find me an apartment.

22
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:49,470
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce,
how may I help you?

23
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:19,940

24
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:30,215
Who is Don Draper?

25
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,498
Excuse me?

26
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,934
Who is Don Draper?

27
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,674
What do men say
when you ask that?

28
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,911
Well, they usually take
a minute to think about it

29
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,680
then they do something cute.

30
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,449
One creative director
said he was a lion tamer.

31
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:58,785
I don't want to do that.

32
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:03,122
- In the third person?
- I don't know.

33
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,825
Knockout wife, two kids,
house in Westchester.

34
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:08,927
Take the train...
Maybe you take your car

35
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:10,561
now that you can afford it.

36
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:12,729
And who told you that?

37
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:14,931
Anything?

38
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:17,033
I mean, now's your chance.

39
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:21,438
Well, as I said before,
I'm from the midwest.

40
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:25,342
We were taught that it's not
polite to talk about yourself.

41
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:32,951
Obviously your glo-coat floor wax
commercials caused a bit of a squeal,

42
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,853
on the creative side anyway.

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,889
What made you think of this idea?

44
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,859
I wanted it to be indistinguishable
from the movies.

45
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,863
I wanted people to be
watching it and say,

46
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,767
"What's happening in the story
right now?"

47
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,403
Oh, it's something else.

48
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:52,040
"It's not an ad."

49
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,577
At least not
for the first 30 seconds of it.

50
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:58,746
Very good then.

51
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:00,649
I think I have all I need.

52
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,984
It's only a few hundred words,
but on the bright side,

53
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:04,887
the picture may be
bigger than the article.

54
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:06,889
Oh, uh, you all should meet.

55
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:09,258
This is Jack Hammond
from "Advertising age."

56
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:11,094
Roger sterling and Pete Campbell.

57
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:12,829
I hope we're not interrupting this crisp

58
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:14,431
and engaging portrait you're painting.

59
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:16,299
Ahh...

60
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,703
Steady there.

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,609
- What happened there?
- Korea.

62
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:27,145
We're grateful for your sacrifice.

63
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:29,114
- Peter.
- Jack.

64
00:03:29,181 --> 00:03:31,249
Well, it's nice to meet you all.

65
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:34,919
I'd love to bend your ear
when I finish my book.

66
00:03:34,987 --> 00:03:36,821
Certainly.

67
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:38,456
Don, it was a pleasure.

68
00:03:38,524 --> 00:03:40,391
- I look forward to the article.
- We all do.

69
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,167
My uncle lost his leg hitching a trailer.

70
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,770
Used to ask me to scratch his toes.

71
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:54,405
- He didn't have any.
- We don't have time, Roger.

72
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:56,741
One quick pop, Louise.

73
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:59,176
All right, where is this party?

74
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:02,379
- The Sheraton?
- A wooden leg...

75
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:05,549
They're so cheap they can't
even afford a whole reporter.

76
00:04:09,654 --> 00:04:12,356
I'm Peter Campbell
and I'm assuming you're Jim.

77
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:15,659
- And this must be Murray.
- Bob... Murray stayed in Portland.

78
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:18,095
Too bad.
Missing jackhammer season.

79
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:19,496
Roger Sterling.

80
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,834
- And you must be Donald Draper.
- Don.

81
00:04:23,902 --> 00:04:25,369
Bob.

82
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,873
We're very very excited you
had time to meet with us, Don.

83
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,178
Murray told us Y&R
had done glo-coat.

84
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:37,247
Turns out everybody in new York
except him knows it's you.

85
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:39,383
And I think they're a little jealous.

86
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:42,719
Can't tell who the client is here.

87
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,922
I know a little,
but what we need to know...

88
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,291
What Don needs to know is

89
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:51,526
what exactly is your concern?

90
00:04:51,594 --> 00:04:53,995
I must say I'm getting
tired of saying this today.

91
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:55,663
Next time just have one meeting.

92
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:00,635
We at Jantzen have had a steady
25% bite of the apple.

93
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:03,404
But the two-piece
is most of our concern.

94
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:06,874
You have a great bikini. I've spent
some time with the catalogue

95
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:09,410
and I would say no concerns at all.

96
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,747
It's not a bikini.

97
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:14,383
A bikini is underwear
you wear to the beach.

98
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:16,819
We make a two-piece bathing suit.

99
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:20,189
We're a family company.

100
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,625
And nowadays it's tough
to make a dent

101
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:25,128
if your ads don't look
like a girlie magazine.

102
00:05:25,196 --> 00:05:28,832
Do you want women who want
bikinis to buy your two-piece

103
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,501
or do you just want to make sure
women who want a two-piece

104
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,202
don't suddenly buy a bikini?

105
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,610
My lord. That question just tied
a knot in my brain.

106
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:44,347
Our competitors get bigger

107
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:46,182
the smaller they make that swimsuit.

108
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,519
We don't do that.

109
00:05:49,587 --> 00:05:52,021
We would like to find a way
without playing in the gutter.

110
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:53,890
And that's just who our customers are.

111
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,792
Right now.

112
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:00,730
I love how they sit there
like a couple of choirboys.

113
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,233
You know one of them's
leaving new York with V.D.

114
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:06,870
Where the hell have you been?

115
00:06:06,938 --> 00:06:08,772
- What's the problem?
- Don!

116
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,341
- Can you give me a minute?
- I don't mind waiting.

117
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,687
- How'd it go?
- Get back to work.

118
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:37,767
How was your interview?

119
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:40,369
Count to 100 and buzz me.

120
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:48,209
You missed Jeff Atherton.

121
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:51,411
He came here expressly to see you.

122
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,547
I'm sorry, I didn't know he was
coming and I don't know who that is.

123
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:58,217
You have no idea how tiny
this place looks to a stranger.

124
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,918
Did you tell him about
the second floor?

125
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:03,221
I refuse to be any part of that charade.

126
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:06,390
I wanted an office downtown.

127
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:09,226
We overspent. We could have got
a lot more for our money.

128
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:10,894
And we could have had
a conference table.

129
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:13,263
Atherton thought the lack
of a conference table

130
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,765
was deliberate. He felt that a...

131
00:07:15,832 --> 00:07:20,001
Circle of chairs
demands a conversation.

132
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,036
About why there is no table.

133
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:27,373
They loved you.

134
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,875
What exactly is the problem?

135
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:32,277
Well, first of all they're prudes.

136
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:35,080
Second of all Y&R were standing
in the hallway when we left.

137
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:37,081
You've been on a cattle call before.

138
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:38,749
When the competition was fair.

139
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:41,484
Every hour of my time
has to be accounted for

140
00:07:41,552 --> 00:07:43,386
in the growth of this company.

141
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:45,721
Get me in a room
where I have a chance.

142
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,760
In the end it's going to come
down to big versus small.

143
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:53,396
There's two firms in the middle:
Kenyon & Eckhardt,

144
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:55,631
and D'arcy.
They'll cancel each other out.

145
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:58,267
Y&R has six floors of creative.

146
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:00,536
They can throw bodies
at this account for weeks.

147
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:03,639
- We don't have that kind of firepower.
- We don't have to.

148
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:06,209
We're the scrappy upstart.

149
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:08,344
You don't say that to the clients, do you?

150
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:10,279
Your accountant is waiting.

151
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:12,215
Send him in.

152
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:15,785
Creatively, Y&R is not capable
of living in this neighborhood.

153
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,953
You know why?

154
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:20,789
Because you don't work there.

155
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:30,698
- John.
- Marsha.

156
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:34,335
- John.
- Marsha.

157
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:38,206
John!

158
00:08:38,273 --> 00:08:40,342
Happy Thanksgiving.

159
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,611
Oooh, my mother's going
to be over the moon.

160
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,147
Enjoy it. It's the last thing
we're going to get from them.

161
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:47,483
- What?
- Did you kill Sugarberry?

162
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:51,188
- That's a third of my work.
- Stop jumping to conclusions.

163
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:53,857
I guess when Kreutzer said they
were going to send us all hams

164
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,294
he really meant one in
a cardboard box with no note.

165
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,262
It's about as subtle
as an atomic bomb.

166
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,997
Maybe they're cheap.

167
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:02,133
Do you honestly think
this is a good sign?

168
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,101
The work was old-fashioned.

169
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,936
And whose fault is that?

170
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,206
Well, testing at four
supermarkets in Queens,

171
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:11,775
how much were they spending?
Nothing.

172
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:14,511
If the test was a success,
they would have gone national

173
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:16,312
and they could be a big account.

174
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,314
Damn it!

175
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:20,316
I thought we were getting on a streak.

176
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,620
Does this mean I'm down
to two days a week?

177
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:27,557
- Don hated the work.
- Put the ham on his desk.

178
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,327
He's probably having
Thanksgiving dinner alone in there.

179
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:31,795
That's not nice.

180
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,964
Marsha!

181
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,599
I'm serious.

182
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,871
Okay, life insurance policy,
it's a company policy.

183
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:43,140
It pays the company, not the family.

184
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,975
What do you think?

185
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:48,445
It wouldn't be bad to have
a little security for the kids.

186
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:51,148
According to this,
I'm already a wealthy man.

187
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,317
Uncle Sam will take a healthy bite.

188
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,951
He already has.

189
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,519
And...

190
00:09:56,587 --> 00:09:59,189
The only other issue is the house.

191
00:09:59,256 --> 00:10:00,657
What about it?

192
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,294
Well, October 1st
she was supposed to be out.

193
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:07,697
It seemed so far away
when we agreed to that.

194
00:10:07,765 --> 00:10:11,701
Get her and him out of there
and sell it.

195
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:15,238
I can call Ben Michaelson
and have him draft a doozy.

196
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,107
Start World War III?

197
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:20,043
You're carrying a mortgage,

198
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,179
plus insurance and taxes

199
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,281
for a house you don't live in.

200
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:27,551
Leave it alone.

201
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:32,156
So how are your balls?
Are you enjoying yourself?

202
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:34,925
Come on.

203
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:37,361
I don't want it like this.
I want it like that.

204
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,831
Not too much of that,
just a little like this.

205
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,701
And then they look at it
and they don't like it.

206
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:46,773
Two of their test markets are in
Jewish neighborhoods. They're idiots.

207
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,110
How much does it cost for us
to buy all the product?

208
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:52,980
Too much and we'd have
to do it every day.

209
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:58,186
So how much does it cost for us to get

210
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:01,155
100 women to line up
at one store, one afternoon,

211
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:03,190
clean them out once?

212
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,926
100 people?
Do you know how big a line that is?

213
00:11:05,994 --> 00:11:07,727
People would talk about it.

214
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:10,196
- It's a P.R. Stunt.
- We don't do that.

215
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:12,865
- Why not?
- Because you can't charge for it.

216
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,635
So what?

217
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:19,706
Two women fighting over one ham,

218
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:21,542
but they have to really fight.

219
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,544
They have to get arrested or something.

220
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:25,079
Because it's the last ham.

221
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:27,515
We don't have to write a play.

222
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,286
It's Thanksgiving. They're shopping.
The stakes are very high.

223
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:32,254
Old Chuck Dewey could
probably get a story

224
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:34,356
in the "Daily news"
for a case of something.

225
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:37,627
$25 per actress.
We could get Gladys what's-her-name.

226
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:40,364
Who's the old lady who never
takes off her mittens?

227
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:42,966
- I don't have any money.
- John!

228
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:44,801
Marsha!

229
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:47,437
I can use my expense account
if I say they're whores.

230
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:49,671
Top-shelf liquor, what's that gonna run?

231
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,640
Harry gets a case a month

232
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:53,775
for sticking his nose
up some guy's ass at N.B.C.

233
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,310
Should I run it by Don?

234
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:57,679
Really?

235
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:02,550
We'll see. I'll call casting.

236
00:12:08,724 --> 00:12:10,892
Oh, good, I got you
when you're vulnerable.

237
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:17,965
- What do you need?
- Someone white to carve our turkey.

238
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,601
I can't, Roger. I have plans.

239
00:12:20,669 --> 00:12:23,838
You told me that. Then you told me
you had the kids the day after.

240
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:27,275
But you never said no
to Jane's friend Bethany.

241
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:30,112
- No.
- I was thinking the other day

242
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:32,814
about what happens when you leave
here and it made me very upset.

243
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:34,916
I could say the same thing.

244
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:37,385
I'll paint you the picture
that's in my mind.

245
00:12:37,453 --> 00:12:39,487
But if it's true, I might kill myself.

246
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:41,657
I've hardly been a monk.

247
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:44,159
Forget that she knows Jane.

248
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:46,828
This girl's terrific.
She looks like Virginia Mayo.

249
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:49,598
She's 25, Mount Holyoke
gymnastics team.

250
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:51,967
See her this weekend.

251
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:54,703
You hit it off, come turkey day
maybe you can stuff her.

252
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:04,046
Sweetheart, 8:00 Saturday night,

253
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:06,348
Jimmy's la Grange
for Beauty and the Beast.

254
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,685
- Roger.
- They have chicken Kiev.

255
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:11,120
The butter squirts everywhere.

256
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,269
- Hello, Mr. Draper.
- Hello, Celia.

257
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:35,378
I made you some pork chops.
They're good cold too.

258
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:37,747
I look forward to it.

259
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:40,449
But you don't eat nothing.

260
00:13:42,818 --> 00:13:45,720
- Have you seen my shine kit?
- I put it on the top of the closet.

261
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:47,922
The children coming this weekend?

262
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,690
No.

263
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:52,927
You need to put things
back where you found them.

264
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:55,596
I didn't want to leave it
in the middle of the floor.

265
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:11,312
Okay, good night.
You have a good weekend.

266
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,348
And eat something.

267
00:14:42,574 --> 00:14:45,209
Let me out of here!

268
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:48,411
Let me out of here!

269
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:52,548
Let me out of here!

270
00:14:54,617 --> 00:14:56,752
Footprints on a wet floor...

271
00:14:56,819 --> 00:14:58,921
That's no longer a hanging offense.

272
00:14:58,988 --> 00:15:01,923
Glo-coat's patented formula

273
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:04,459
goes on easy
and dries in seconds.

274
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:11,018
So how do you know Jane?

275
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:14,489
Before you ask me all the questions,
you have to let me finish one glass.

276
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:18,426
I don't have to ask you
any questions.

277
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:22,362
I think I'm actually nervous.

278
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,930
I haven't done this since college.

279
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:27,933
Not that it was so long ago,
although it seems like it.

280
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,135
I borrowed a dress.

281
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:32,904
You sat down so fast
I didn't get a good look.

282
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:34,339
Do you want to see it?

283
00:16:49,621 --> 00:16:51,489
I can't believe I did that.

284
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:55,860
It's hard to believe there are
two girls who can wear that.

285
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:00,432
Don, I want to lift
a shadow off this evening.

286
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:03,234
I know this is your first date.

287
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,303
First that Roger was involved in.

288
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:07,872
Oh, of course. I'm sure. It's just...

289
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:13,111
I'm breaking a lot of my rules
seeing a divorced man.

290
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:17,882
But Jane has made you
her personal cause.

291
00:17:19,684 --> 00:17:22,819
And there are so many
real problems in the world.

292
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:25,989
I know.

293
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:28,458
The world is so dark right now.

294
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:31,193
The country?

295
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:35,030
My goodness, you've made me
feel very serious all of a sudden.

296
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:39,568
I don't know if I can make you
feel better about the world.

297
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:41,871
One of the boys killed in Mississippi...

298
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:44,741
Andrew Goodman, he was from here.

299
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,278
A girlfriend of mine
knew him from summer camp.

300
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:51,082
Is that what it takes to change things?

301
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:55,921
What do you do?

302
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:58,424
I'm an actress.

303
00:17:58,492 --> 00:18:00,760
But right now I'm a super
in the opera.

304
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:04,197
- And what is that?
- A supernumerary.

305
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:06,833
We're the actors that fill the stage.

306
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,969
Like the chorus?

307
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:10,904
Mmm, no singing.

308
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:12,639
I do a lot of mock drinking.

309
00:18:12,707 --> 00:18:15,075
I'm a wench. I'm a...

310
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:17,176
Courtesan.

311
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:20,514
Part of a harem.
It depends on the opera.

312
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:24,117
That is truly fascinating.

313
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:27,388
I love the music.

314
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,324
And I love backstage.

315
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:33,662
Our costumes are as good
as the singers.

316
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,931
And I love the stories.

317
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:38,634
They're very romantic.

318
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,536
Have you been?

319
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,504
I have.

320
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:46,273
But only for business
so I've never enjoyed it.

321
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,876
Well, then you must come as my guest.

322
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:53,981
They give the supers tickets instead
of paying a decent wage.

323
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:57,684
- Madam?
- Oh, I don't even need to look.

324
00:18:57,752 --> 00:18:59,386
Chicken Kiev.

325
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:01,121
They make you wear a bib.

326
00:19:01,189 --> 00:19:04,058
Come on, let's have some fun.

327
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:06,828
Two chicken Kievs.

328
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:17,775
The barbizon.

329
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:19,577
I bet that would make a great opera.

330
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:21,879
It would.

331
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:24,548
Well, I guess this is good night.

332
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:27,085
Okay.

333
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,923
Good night.

334
00:19:33,093 --> 00:19:36,095
So am I going to see you at
Roger and Jane's for Thanksgiving?

335
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:40,432
It's tempting, but...

336
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:42,567
I have plans.

337
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:45,836
Oh, I'm sure the holidays
must be very complex.

338
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:06,555
It may have been awhile since
you've had to pick up on messages,

339
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,824
but I want to see you again.

340
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:12,059
How about right now?

341
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,228
I stopped the meter.
We can start it again.

342
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,197
It'll be like I just picked you up.

343
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:18,132
Will you please take a weak no?

344
00:20:20,202 --> 00:20:22,437
Let's see where
we are New Year's Eve.

345
00:20:22,504 --> 00:20:25,573
- If it's meant to be, it'll keep.
- Let me walk you in.

346
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,409
No.

347
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,645
I know that trick.

348
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,603
Waverly and 6th Avenue.

349
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:01,611
I think you both really
acquitted yourselves well.

350
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,848
She doesn't know when to stop.
You don't know when to stop.

351
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:07,584
My objective was to get the ham.

352
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:09,319
No one told you to hit me.

353
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:11,288
That wasn't part of it.

354
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:14,624
The important thing is that...
Oh, here's Mr. Campbell.

355
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:20,196
I've been assured you ladies
can look for your names

356
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:22,832
and perhaps your picture
in Monday's "Daily news."

357
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,269
- What section?
- It's the "Daily news."
It's one big section.

358
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:31,374
All in all, not a bad way
to spend a Sunday.

359
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:35,778
Can you go back to the market
and get me some aspirin?

360
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:38,647
We probably shouldn't have any
more contact for the time being.

361
00:21:40,517 --> 00:21:41,984
Shall we?

362
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:48,656
We really appreciate your talent

363
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:50,658
and of course, your discretion.

364
00:21:50,725 --> 00:21:52,259
- You hurt me.
- Ow ow ow!

365
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,261
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

366
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:57,831
- Daisy!
- Walk her to the train.

367
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:01,736
- Are you okay, dear?
- Yeah.

368
00:22:03,372 --> 00:22:05,240
Let's get you in a cab.

369
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,949
- Good morning.
- Welcome back. How was Los Angeles?

370
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:14,684
Very hard to leave.

371
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:17,587
I would love a vacation.

372
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:19,390
It wasn't a vacation.

373
00:22:19,457 --> 00:22:21,559
I had a lot of tsuris with Lucy and Desi.

374
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:23,561
Has someone been using my office?

375
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:25,329
Mr. Sterling doesn't have a television.

376
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,665
I'm calling
a meeting for 11:00.

377
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,968
No, make it 1:00.
Do we have a table yet?

378
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:32,204
1:30 and no.

379
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,908
- Hi.
- Yes?

380
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:38,077
- Do you know where
the seacore rough cut is?
- I got it!

381
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:43,382
Don't you want to know why?

382
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,618
I sold the Jai Alai TV special.

383
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:47,854
Really?

384
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:49,722
A.B.C. They're moving towards

385
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,791
all these eccentric sporting events.
Go-karts.

386
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:54,160
Well, that's very exciting.

387
00:22:54,228 --> 00:22:56,229
Can you get someone to track
down a cup of coffee for me?

388
00:22:56,297 --> 00:22:58,365
And I'd love a grapefruit juice.
And, Joan?

389
00:22:58,432 --> 00:23:02,035
- That is my news.
- I won't even tell people
after it's aired.

390
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:08,575
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

391
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:12,612
Don, can I speak
with you for a minute?

392
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:22,122
Morning.

393
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,591
- Lane, would you excuse us
for a minute?
- Of course.

394
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,493
Good morning, Don.

395
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:34,102
You know,

396
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:36,705
no one who's ever been
associated with an actual event

397
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:39,407
has thought it's been portrayed
honestly in the newspaper.

398
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:45,714
"Donald Draper, or Don as he is known

399
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:49,017
perhaps in an attempt to appear
humble, is a handsome cipher.

400
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,888
One imagines somewhere in an attic

401
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:55,157
there's a painting of him
that's rapidly aging."

402
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,727
For a guy from "Ad age"
he can really write.

403
00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:01,330
- He also says you're married.
- Jesus.

404
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,233
He never asked me that.
Did he check any facts?

405
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:06,268
You didn't give him any facts.

406
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:09,972
- He had to make some assumptions.
- My job is to write ads,

407
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,041
not go around talking about who I am.

408
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:14,143
Who knows who you are?

409
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:17,247
This was supposed to be
an advertisement for the firm.

410
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:19,115
Why do you have so many copies?

411
00:24:19,183 --> 00:24:21,050
I bought one to read.

412
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:23,887
I was going to buy one to frame
in reception, and then I read it.

413
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:26,356
I just wanted to get them all
before anyone else did.

414
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,458
It'll be lining bird cages by Friday.

415
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:30,894
This is a missed opportunity.

416
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:33,830
You turned all the sizzle
from Glo-coat into a wet fart.

417
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:36,065
Plus you sound like a prick.

418
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:38,134
Well, it's done.

419
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,037
I learned a valuable lesson:

420
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,105
Stay away from one-legged reporters.

421
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:44,840
Yeah, I was thinking about that...

422
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:47,276
Who is he to criticize anybody?

423
00:24:47,344 --> 00:24:51,347
Just so you don't kill yourself,
there was some good news.

424
00:24:51,414 --> 00:24:53,349
Jane's friend found
you to be charming.

425
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,184
Although a little grabby in the car.

426
00:24:55,252 --> 00:24:57,620
That is good news.
Thank you.

427
00:24:57,688 --> 00:25:00,056
She liked you. Maybe you should
have fondled peg-leg Pete.

428
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,159
They raise you up
and they knock you down.

429
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:04,594
I don't know what
I could have done differently.

430
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:07,430
I believe that you were
being modest, but he didn't.

431
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:09,933
I'm sorry, but after
the year you've had,

432
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:11,868
it's just not appropriate anymore.

433
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,608
He's expecting us!

434
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:22,779
- Is Joey coming?
- I'm here.

435
00:25:22,847 --> 00:25:25,949
- Oh.
- Why can't you come to our office?

436
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:29,218
- Do you want to hear what
sugarberry said or not?
- Shoot.

437
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:32,588
It was uproarious.
First it's Darryl, and he tells me about

438
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,825
how they stared at the article all day
yesterday worrying about a lawsuit.

439
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:38,028
So I hang up and debate
whether or not to tell Don...

440
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:40,430
Throw myself on my sword.
And then Kreutzer calls

441
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,532
to tell me other papers
picked up the story.

442
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,734
And I think, "he knows it's us,"
but how could he?

443
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:48,271
And he said everyone,
especially Darryl, was very excited.

444
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,641
And then he gets Christian:

445
00:25:50,708 --> 00:25:52,876
He's sorry someone got hurt,

446
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:55,045
but more people will
taste their ham now

447
00:25:55,113 --> 00:25:57,281
and they'll love it.

448
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,350
It's beautiful. How do you put
something like this in your book?

449
00:26:00,418 --> 00:26:02,219
You can't.
We can't even charge them.

450
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:03,554
It wouldn't be a bad idea

451
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:05,556
for them to increase
their media budget.

452
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:08,058
- Seize the moment.
- With more crappy ads?

453
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:10,293
- Hopefully not.
- You use it.

454
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:14,130
The winner of the ham battle is you.

455
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,732
Can you imagine? Lane's dentures
would drop out of his head

456
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,401
if we came in with an additional buy.

457
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:23,973
"Our hams are worth fighting for."

458
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:30,480
A cartoon pilgrim and an Indian
in a tug of war with the ham.

459
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,349
Old ladies will smile.

460
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:36,218
Why didn't you pitch that two
months ago? It's good on its own.

461
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:38,321
A slogan's nothing
when you have a good idea.

462
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:41,957
Black crayon. I need it in an hour.

463
00:26:42,025 --> 00:26:43,859
Chop chop, Joey.

464
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:48,498
Clara, could you get Darryl
for me at Sugarberry?

465
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:51,534
Tell him it's urgent.
I may need you.

466
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:55,638
Horace Cook, Jr. it's urgent.

467
00:26:56,874 --> 00:26:59,676
Ho-ho!
How was Tijuana?

468
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,046
I have to say,
it's a very flattering picture.

469
00:27:03,114 --> 00:27:06,016
And I don't think I'd mind being
described that way.

470
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,017
Mr. Crane, you're a salesman.

471
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,887
You do not want to be
known as mysterious.

472
00:27:10,955 --> 00:27:12,822
There'll be no further discussion.

473
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,325
I just got off the phone with ho-ho.

474
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:17,827
- Jai Alai is leaving.
- What?

475
00:27:17,895 --> 00:27:21,664
- It's over.
- Bullshit. I just sold a TV special
to A.B.C.

476
00:27:21,732 --> 00:27:25,001
Well, apparently Don didn't
mention them in the article.

477
00:27:26,804 --> 00:27:29,406
I didn't mention anyone.
That's the reporter's job.

478
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:35,578
- Spectacular.
- What the hell's ho-ho
doing reading "Ad age"?

479
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:38,014
- Fix it.
- Todd got all the partners

480
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:40,817
from C.G.C. To call and they
worked him up and down.

481
00:27:40,885 --> 00:27:42,352
They told him we laugh about him.

482
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,387
I don't! Get him him on the phone,

483
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,756
get him in here
or camp out in his driveway.

484
00:27:46,824 --> 00:27:49,626
He hung up on me.

485
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:52,362
I think he was crying.

486
00:27:54,098 --> 00:27:56,933
How much was left in ho-ho anyway?

487
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,969
We'll survive with Jai Alai off our list.

488
00:28:00,036 --> 00:28:02,304
We will survive, but for how long?

489
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:03,872
The loss of Jai Alai

490
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,908
makes Lucky Strike 71% of our billings.

491
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,110
It's an untenably insecure position.

492
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:15,249
Harry, why don't you call and pretend
like you don't know any of this.

493
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:17,651
Give it an hour
so he'll take the call.

494
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:20,288
I wish we really had
a second floor so I could jump off it.

495
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:31,835
I'm going to have to get
you another interview.

496
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:35,239
"The Wall Street Journal."

497
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:37,174
And what do I do differently?

498
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:39,209
I told him the truth.

499
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:42,012
Who gives a crap what I say
anyway? My work speaks for me.

500
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,850
Turning creative success
into business is your work.

501
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:48,552
And you've failed.

502
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:58,997
It'll pass.

503
00:29:07,273 --> 00:29:10,142
- Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

504
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,911
We started without you.

505
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:14,380
Oh, grandma Pauline,
I told you mother's was at noon.

506
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:16,849
- We already ate.
- You're supposed to overeat
on Thanksgiving.

507
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,119
Ooh, thank you.

508
00:29:19,186 --> 00:29:21,754
Jamie, you'll have something?

509
00:29:21,822 --> 00:29:24,490
We missed dessert.

510
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:26,992
You're next to your father.

511
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,028
- Put up some coffee, dear.
- Hi, daddy.

512
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:31,963
Isn't that sweet?

513
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,867
We didn't forget you.

514
00:29:39,072 --> 00:29:40,673
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

515
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,408
- Thanks.
- After you eat.

516
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:47,880
The traffic was simply murder.

517
00:29:47,948 --> 00:29:50,583
That's because that's
what's become of this country.

518
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:53,019
Everyone has two
thanksgivings to go to.

519
00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:56,456
Maybe we have twice as much
to be thankful for.

520
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:05,030
Don't you like the food, dear?

521
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:07,766
- No.
- Sally Draper, that's rude.

522
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:11,369
- You love cranberry sauce.
- It has seeds in it.

523
00:30:11,437 --> 00:30:14,139
- How about the sweet potato?
- I'm not hungry.

524
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:17,508
Look, there's marshmallow.

525
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:23,681
Oh lord.

526
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:30,054
She might have a fever.

527
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,423
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right, dear.

528
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:36,227
- Isabel, can you bring a rag?
- Ow, stop pinching me!

529
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:44,901
I love sweet potatoes.

530
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:51,874
Isabel!

531
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:55,778
Happy Thanksgiving.

532
00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:05,321
- Do you want a drink?
- I don't have much time.

533
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:07,557
- I have supper with my family.
- Oh.

534
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:10,561
- Of course you do.
- Should I not have mentioned
my family?

535
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:12,563
I never know how
you're going to react.

536
00:31:12,631 --> 00:31:14,499
No, that's fine.

537
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:28,313
- Let me take off my brassiere.
- No. In a minute.

538
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:30,948
Stop telling me what to do.
I know what you want.

539
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,551
So do it.

540
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:38,389
Harder.

541
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:42,059
Again.

542
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:57,376
Hold on.

543
00:32:02,215 --> 00:32:04,450
Surprise, it's for you.

544
00:32:08,054 --> 00:32:10,289
Why did you answer it?

545
00:32:10,357 --> 00:32:12,358
It was the third try.
I couldn't take it.

546
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:19,131
- Hello?
- Happy Thanksgiving.

547
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:21,300
Happy Thanksgiving.

548
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:24,303
I'm sorry to bother you.
I didn't know you'd have guests.

549
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,538
What's wrong?

550
00:32:26,606 --> 00:32:29,841
I need $280 for bail.

551
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:32,710
Bye.

552
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:35,913
- Where are you?
- It... it's not for me.

553
00:32:40,218 --> 00:32:42,786
Spit it out, honey.

554
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:45,722
You're going to laugh.

555
00:32:47,291 --> 00:32:49,291
Pete and I hired some actresses

556
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:52,494
to get in a fight
over a sugarberry ham.

557
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:54,729
You know, as a stunt.

558
00:32:54,797 --> 00:32:57,131
We got them to increase
their media budget.

559
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:00,335
Hello?

560
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:02,304
I'm here.

561
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:05,340
Well, one of them pressed
charges against the other

562
00:33:05,408 --> 00:33:07,476
for assault. It's $80 bail

563
00:33:07,543 --> 00:33:09,778
and $100 apiece to keep
their mouths shut.

564
00:33:09,846 --> 00:33:12,347
And it has to happen today.

565
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:14,316
Call Pete!

566
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:17,620
Do you think you're my first call?

567
00:33:21,524 --> 00:33:23,926
Hello.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

568
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:26,295
- I oughta let you twist in the wind.
- It still worked out.

569
00:33:26,363 --> 00:33:28,832
- You'll be very happy.
- I'm not happy.

570
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,134
And I don't think it's funny or cute.

571
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:33,203
You run something
like that by me first.

572
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:35,372
I would have kept you
from looking like an idiot,

573
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,540
or worse yet, making me look like one.
Is that what you want?

574
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,910
You want people to think
we're idiots, Peggy?

575
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:43,612
Hey, there's no reason
for name-calling.

576
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,448
- She's been agonizing.
- Who are you?

577
00:33:46,516 --> 00:33:48,717
I'm her fiance.

578
00:33:48,785 --> 00:33:51,119
Mark, don't.

579
00:33:51,187 --> 00:33:54,189
Why'd you bring him up here
if you didn't want him involved?

580
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:58,026
I know. I'm sorry, Don.

581
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:04,200
- Fiance?
- It just came out.

582
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:14,812
- Did you put the dog out?
- It's cold outside.

583
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,581
But I locked her in the laundry room.

584
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:24,922
It's not cold in here.

585
00:34:39,236 --> 00:34:41,371
Sally.

586
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:44,274
I was calling daddy.

587
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:46,911
Hello?

588
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:49,281
I wanted to wish him
a happy Thanksgiving.

589
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:51,583
You'll see him tomorrow.

590
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:53,920
You want to call him to complain
about how awful I am?

591
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:57,590
Don't expect any sympathy when
he hears my side of the story.

592
00:34:57,658 --> 00:34:59,425
- Don't!
- Go to bed.

593
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,335
I'm going to have them take
that phone out of the hallway.

594
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:10,970
Mmm.

595
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:20,780
Tomorrow when the kids go,

596
00:35:20,848 --> 00:35:23,983
why don't we have Carla take the
baby and we'll drive to a nice dinner?

597
00:35:26,053 --> 00:35:27,821
Maybe Essex.

598
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:29,622
The Griswold Inn.

599
00:35:31,926 --> 00:35:33,293
Okay.

600
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:39,565
I'm really full, Betty.

601
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:50,858
Daddy!

602
00:35:50,926 --> 00:35:52,794
- Oooh!
- Dad.

603
00:35:55,764 --> 00:35:58,333
- How much turkey did you eat?
- I ate everything.

604
00:35:58,401 --> 00:36:01,436
Hello, daddy.

605
00:36:01,504 --> 00:36:03,405
Hello.

606
00:36:06,911 --> 00:36:09,413
- 9:00 tomorrow night.
- Where's the baby?

607
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,949
I had Carla take him.
You weren't going to.

608
00:36:12,017 --> 00:36:14,351
- Henry and I have plans.
- I'd like to see him.

609
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:19,056
- Hello, Don.
- Henry.

610
00:36:19,124 --> 00:36:21,925
Come on, let's go.

611
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:41,445
Garage door.

612
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:49,920
- What are you doing?
- You know what I'm doing.

613
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:01,430
The button fell off my pajamas.

614
00:37:01,497 --> 00:37:03,298
I'll sew it on in the morning.

615
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:04,966
You know how to sew?

616
00:37:05,034 --> 00:37:07,268
I can do a button. I'll show you.

617
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:15,010
I'll leave the light on in the bathroom

618
00:37:15,078 --> 00:37:16,913
so there won't be
any more problems, okay?

619
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:19,549
- Okay.
- Good night, daddy.

620
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,554
Good night,

621
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:25,490
both of you.

622
00:38:06,932 --> 00:38:09,201
Do you have your key?

623
00:38:26,052 --> 00:38:28,487
- Hello?
- Maybe they're asleep.

624
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,990
Go upstairs.

625
00:38:58,052 --> 00:39:00,153
Let go!

626
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:07,059
What the hell is the dog
doing in the house?

627
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:10,295
You run up to bed. I'll wait.

628
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:12,398
For what?

629
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:14,434
Oh.

630
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:16,803
It's almost 10:00.

631
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:19,639
- I thought you said 10:00.
- She didn't.

632
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:21,341
I've waited for you
plenty of times.

633
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:24,277
Henry, do you mind?

634
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:27,414
- Betty?
- It's okay.

635
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:29,283
Does that mean I should stay
or not stay?

636
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,618
Stay.

637
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,690
When are you moving out?

638
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:38,692
I don't know.

639
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,261
You were supposed
to be out a month ago.

640
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:43,264
We haven't found the right
place for the kids.

641
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:46,568
Well, either do as we agreed or
I'm going to need to collect rent.

642
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:49,838
- What?
- Or you could just buy it
from me if you want to.

643
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:51,707
I can't believe you.

644
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:54,309
Don, it's temporary.

645
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:57,879
Believe me, Henry, everybody
thinks this is temporary.

646
00:39:57,947 --> 00:40:00,214
Good night.

647
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,888
He has some nerve.

648
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:10,390
I know you don't want to hear this,

649
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:12,925
but he's right.

650
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,928
Haven't the kids been through
enough change already?

651
00:40:15,995 --> 00:40:18,664
I can't just uproot them
with no place to go.

652
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:21,132
You're not even looking.

653
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,601
There's nothing out there,
and he doesn't decide.

654
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:36,647
Miss olson is here to see you.

655
00:40:41,854 --> 00:40:43,756
Send her in.

656
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,097
They sent one for each of us.

657
00:40:53,334 --> 00:40:55,568
Could have just as easily fired us.

658
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:58,806
But they didn't because
they sold more hams.

659
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,843
And now you get to tell them why,
if you want.

660
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,177
I think they'll be impressed.

661
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:06,314
Well, I'm not.

662
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:10,719
I try and stay away from
these kinds of shenanigans.

663
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:13,088
But I guess you knew that
or you would have told me.

664
00:41:13,155 --> 00:41:16,724
It was going great until it wasn't.

665
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:19,127
Thanks for the ham.

666
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:22,563
I should have told you.

667
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:26,900
Since when do you have a fiance?

668
00:41:26,968 --> 00:41:28,869
I don't.

669
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,207
But you didn't have
to do that that way.

670
00:41:33,274 --> 00:41:36,177
You brought him with you because
you thought I wouldn't embarrass you.

671
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,012
At least I'm thinking ahead.

672
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,649
Doesn't always work, does it?

673
00:41:43,053 --> 00:41:46,422
You need to think a little bit more
about the image of this agency.

674
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:49,225
Well, nobody knows
about the ham stunt,

675
00:41:49,293 --> 00:41:53,130
so our image remains
pretty much where you left it.

676
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:56,400
I won't need you in
the jantzen presentation.

677
00:41:56,468 --> 00:41:59,269
- Now you're being spiteful.
- No.

678
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:01,905
I just think it would be better not
to have a girl in the room.

679
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,477
You know something?

680
00:42:07,545 --> 00:42:09,379
We are all here because of you.

681
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:13,550
All we want to do is please you.

682
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,059
Why don't I put them in the pantry?

683
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,961
Christmas is around the corner.

684
00:42:26,029 --> 00:42:29,164
Put them in the basement.

685
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:31,727
Did the children like their gifts?

686
00:42:31,795 --> 00:42:33,395
They did.

687
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:39,735
It's nice the holiday is
memorable in some other way.

688
00:42:39,803 --> 00:42:42,905
I'm sorry a little girl
spoiled your Thanksgiving.

689
00:42:43,678 --> 00:42:45,079
Next time I'll tell her
not to get sick.

690
00:42:45,114 --> 00:42:47,231
I've raised children in my life, Henry.

691
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,600
They're terrified of her.

692
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,002
You don't know any of the people
you're talking about.

693
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,004
Well, I know what you see in her.

694
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,941
And you could have gotten it
without marrying.

695
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:59,510
Why can't you give her a chance?

696
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,280
- She loves you.
- She's a silly woman.

697
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,482
Honestly, Henry,

698
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,085
I don't know how you can stand
living in that man's dirt.

699
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:19,296
You go to the swimming pool,
you go to the beach,

700
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:21,632
take off your robe,
you head into the cabana.

701
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,842
There's no other way
to slice it, you're getting undressed.

702
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:27,586
Can I put my feet on this?

703
00:43:27,877 --> 00:43:28,998
- Pretend like it's your living room.
- Thank you.

704
00:43:30,567 --> 00:43:33,903
What separates a bathing suit
from underwear?

705
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:36,439
The cut and the print of the cloth

706
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:38,955
and some sort of
gentlemen's agreement.

707
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,037
"So well built,

708
00:43:47,105 --> 00:43:49,273
we can't show you the second floor."

709
00:43:58,016 --> 00:44:00,617
I think that's a little suggestive.

710
00:44:00,685 --> 00:44:03,320
Good. That's what I was going for.

711
00:44:03,388 --> 00:44:05,656
A wink, but it's not a leer.

712
00:44:05,724 --> 00:44:08,192
We don't want a wink.

713
00:44:08,259 --> 00:44:11,729
I think I explained our product
is for modest people.

714
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:14,531
Modest people want
to be stimulated too.

715
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:16,367
This draws them in in a way

716
00:44:16,434 --> 00:44:18,869
that will make your competitors
seem crude and obvious.

717
00:44:19,258 --> 00:44:21,121
Plus they'll be dying
to see the suit.

718
00:44:21,297 --> 00:44:22,552
They'll be dying to see the girl.

719
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,689
And for all we know
she's not even wearing a top.

720
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:27,432
You'll get them into the store.

721
00:44:28,682 --> 00:44:29,545
Isn't that the point?

722
00:44:30,761 --> 00:44:32,113
It's not wholesome.

723
00:44:32,905 --> 00:44:36,144
It's not... Did I tell you we're
a family company?

724
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:37,633
I think I know what
you're looking for.

725
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:40,667
A couple of women
bouncing a beach ball,

726
00:44:40,735 --> 00:44:42,869
little girl in front of them
building a sandcastle.

727
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:46,973
Your competitors are
gonna keep killing you

728
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,975
because you're too scared
of the skin

729
00:44:49,043 --> 00:44:51,711
that your two-piece
was designed to show off.

730
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:55,248
Well, it's somehow dirtier

731
00:44:55,316 --> 00:44:57,817
not seeing anything.

732
00:44:57,885 --> 00:45:00,386
You need to decide what kind
of company you want to be...

733
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:04,390
Comfortable and dead
or risky and possibly rich.

734
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:06,626
All I know is we don't want that.

735
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:11,698
Well, gentlemen, you were  wondering
what a creative agency looks like,

736
00:45:11,766 --> 00:45:13,833
there you have it.

737
00:45:13,901 --> 00:45:16,469
Hope you enjoyed
looking in the window.

738
00:45:16,537 --> 00:45:18,471
Give me a minute.

739
00:45:21,242 --> 00:45:23,209
Where are you going?

740
00:45:23,277 --> 00:45:25,445
Control yourself.

741
00:45:25,513 --> 00:45:27,747
Now cool off.

742
00:45:27,815 --> 00:45:31,151
Hopefully Campbell can talk them
into hearing a few more ideas
in a week or so.

743
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:32,952
What?
No.

744
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,788
That's not the point.

745
00:45:36,957 --> 00:45:38,258
Out. Get out.

746
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:39,726
- Don.
- Excuse me?

747
00:45:39,794 --> 00:45:42,061
Get your things and get out
of my office now.

748
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:45,398
Come on, let's go.

749
00:45:53,808 --> 00:45:56,176
Call Bert Cooper's man
at "The Wall Street Journal."

750
00:46:03,717 --> 00:46:05,752
There's always a name
in every partnership

751
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,554
that defines who they are.

752
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:09,823
In the case of
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce

753
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:11,825
would you say
that's Donald Draper?

754
00:46:11,892 --> 00:46:14,561
Yes.

755
00:46:14,628 --> 00:46:16,763
Really?

756
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,099
Last year our agency
was being swallowed whole.

757
00:46:20,167 --> 00:46:22,569
I realized I had two choices.

758
00:46:22,636 --> 00:46:25,371
I could die of boredom

759
00:46:25,439 --> 00:46:27,273
or holster up my guns.

760
00:46:29,143 --> 00:46:31,878
So I walked into Lane Pryce's
office and I said,

761
00:46:31,946 --> 00:46:33,680
"fire us."

762
00:46:37,418 --> 00:46:40,720
Two days later we were operating out
of the Pierre hotel.

763
00:46:40,788 --> 00:46:44,257
Within a year we had taken over
two floors of the time-life building.
