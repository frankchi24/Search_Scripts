1
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,422
I need to speak with you.

2
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,887
Away from the neighbors?

3
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,260
Roger.

4
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,396
So, here we are.

5
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,270
Weeks later, man out of town.

6
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,654
Well, I know you, Red.
This is the tenderloin of your distress.

7
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,106
I'm late.

8
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,984
-What?
-I'm very late.

9
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,159
Congratulations.

10
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,078
-I thought you should know.
-Me?

11
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,127
He's been gone for seven weeks.
It can't be his.

12
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,596
-Are you sure?
-There hasn't been anyone else.

13
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,173
No, no, are you sure you're...

14
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,884
You know,
are you sure that's what's going on?

15
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,184
Have you had a rabbit test?

16
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,180
I can't go to my doctor.

17
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,315
Hey, look at me.

18
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,354
You're overreacting. One step at a time.

19
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,651
Let me take care of this.

20
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,442
I'm really sorry.

21
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,115
These things happen, right?

22
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,990
Will you stop being so upset?

23
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,756
Very well, then. I'll wait on your word.

24
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,009
Buck up. It's gonna be fine.

25
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,886
Get me an outside line.

26
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,529
-Francis residence.
-it's me. Has Sally left for camp yet?

27
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,731
-No.
-Can I speak with her?

28
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,282
You can try.

29
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,819
Sally, come in here!

30
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,952
Your father is on the phone.

31
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,041
Talk to him.

32
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,836
-Hello.
-I missed you this weekend.

33
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,925
And I have a big surprise for you.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,047
Can you keep a secret?

35
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,547
Do you think your friends
are going to be jealous

36
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,598
when they find out
that you're going to see The Beatles

37
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,096
on Sunday at Shea Stadium?

38
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,511
-What?
-You heard me.

39
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,226
Hello? Sally?

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,107
What's going on?

41
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,231
I'm gonna need her Sunday.
We're going to see The Beatles.

42
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:13,118
Oh, my goodness. Sally, say thank you.

43
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,035
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

44
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,957
You can't be mad at me if I wear earplugs.

45
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,834
I won't. I promise.

46
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,953
Okay, see you Sunday.

47
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,876
You have a guest in reception.

48
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,461
I'm on my way.

49
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,440
Hello.

50
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,276
Lane, you're looking well.

51
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,787
This is unexpected.

52
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,495
Have you brought Nigel?

53
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:01,746
No, I haven't.

54
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,830
Good morning, Lane.
That's quite a reception.

55
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,884
John Gibbons, George Casey,
this is Robert Pryce, my father.

56
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,802
-Hello.
-Sir.

57
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,632
-Laura will show you inside.
-Pleasure to meet you.

58
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,468
I'm here to bring you home.

59
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,720
This was not the arrangement.

60
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,393
Rebecca doesn't want to see you
unless you're in London.

61
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,145
But Nigel does.

62
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,817
I'm here to bring you home.

63
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,113
I'll be at the Warwick until Friday.
That should be ample time.

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,949
Well, there's no reason to stay, then.

65
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,032
Well, I suppose we should at least
dine together.

66
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,285
Have you plans for this evening?

67
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,664
I do now.

68
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,521
I guess we're just a little confused about
what it is we're selling.

69
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,777
Senator Murphy would be appreciative

70
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,985
if voters were very aware of
the hundreds of millions of dollars

71
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,615
he's brought to California.

72
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,239
North American Aviation
is a friend of Anaheim.

73
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,704
Pork is only half of it.

74
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,582
The guidance and control systems
in the Minuteman II

75
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,755
have significant civilian potential.

76
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,879
United, TWA, American,
they're gonna want this.

77
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,964
So you never have to say
the word "bomb," right?

78
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,509
That's good.

79
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,257
Gentlemen. Don't get up.

80
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,720
How would you feel about avoiding
the idea of defense altogether?

81
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,638
If you think that's best.

82
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,815
We'd prefer something
more comprehensive, though.

83
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,394
Defense, cutting-edge technology
and, of course, the Moon.

84
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,149
We've got a 60% bump
in our advertising budget to $4 million.

85
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,446
I assume this means television.

86
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,619
We're taking this very seriously.

87
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,155
And so are we.

88
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,329
We see this as the beginning of a new era

89
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,706
in the relationship
between North American Aviation,

90
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,503
and Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

91
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,332
There'll be fewer black bars
as the process moves forward.

92
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,709
-Gibby. George.
-Don.

93
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,420
-Good to see you both again.
-Likewise.

94
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,095
I should get on a plane
to the coast immediately.

95
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,017
Why? I thought we were talking about
Meet the Press.

96
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,266
I don't see Minuteman missiles
breaking up the Hillbillies.

97
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,848
I have to go anyway.

98
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,432
Give me those tickets
before you go anywhere.

99
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,854
Don't worry. They're coming.

100
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,773
I'm not worried. Not in the slightest.

101
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,201
My father has come to visit.

102
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,324
I wonder if you might
join us for dinner this evening.

103
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,367
I may have plans.

104
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,449
I'd consider it a personal favor.

105
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,032
So how long is your visit?

106
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,700
Too short.

107
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,825
So, Father,
how have you found your accommodations?

108
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,747
Adequate, sixth floor.

109
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,823
Father likes a view.

110
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,452
I was quite impressed with your office.

111
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,539
I think the view's better here.

112
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:39,797
Hello, gentlemen. I'm your bunny, Judy.
May I see your key, please?

113
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,879
Lane Pryce.

114
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,422
Are you the keyholder
or is this a borrowed key?

115
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,391
I am the keyholder.

116
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,935
May I take your cocktail order, Mr. Pryce?

117
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,933
Three whiskey sours would do.

118
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,687
She's asking what you want,
not how many you've had.

119
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,148
I'll have a nice bourbon.

120
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,397
Whiskey sour sounds good.

121
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,366
And, Judy,

122
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,905
could you see if
that lovely creature could drop by?

123
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,332
Of course.

124
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,165
So what's your line, Robert?

125
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,885
Carrington Surgical, but I retired.

126
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,879
Father was a salesman.

127
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,057
And, therefore, no stranger to
places such as these.

128
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:31,436
Hello. How are you gentlemen this evening?

129
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,979
Quite good, thank you.

130
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,149
Toni, I'd like to introduce you
to some special guests of mine.

131
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,898
My father Robert and my colleague Don.

132
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,781
I tried to get us booked in your section,
but it seems you're very popular.

133
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,786
Mr. Pryce.

134
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,000
I hope you gentlemen enjoy
your evening with us,

135
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,577
and let me know if there's anything I can do.

136
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,253
We will.

137
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,085
She's the finest waitress-

138
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,808
I'd be partial to anyone
who brings us our drinks.

139
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,479
Hello, may I help you?

140
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,774
-Is this the Francis home?
-It is.

141
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,648
I'm special Agent Norris
and this is special Agent Landingham

142
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,731
from the Department of Defense.
May we come in?

143
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,656
What is this regarding?

144
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,576
I promise there's no reason to be alarmed.

145
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,175
I... Well, I don't know what this is regarding,

146
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,048
but I'm sure you'd rather
speak with my husband,

147
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,595
and he's not home, obviously.

148
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,881
We need to speak with you.

149
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,012
Your ex-husband
Donald Draper has requested

150
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,096
security clearance regarding business with
the United States Government,

151
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,772
and it's our job to confirm his application.

152
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,604
It's a routine background check, so,
you see, there's no reason to be nervous.

153
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,447
No, of course.

154
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,242
Do you mind if I get my cigarettes?

155
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,823
Of course not.

156
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:30,055
So, Mrs. Francis, you were married to
Donald Draper for how long?

157
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,056
Eleven years.

158
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,806
And, in general, would you describe him
as a man of integrity?

159
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,309
We divorced. We obviously had differences.

160
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,890
No, of course.

161
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,684
Do you recall any of the magazines
or newspapers

162
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,269
Mr. Draper read when you were married?

163
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,697
Anything that struck you as radical
or subversive in nature?

164
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,276
No. He read, but mostly for work.

165
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,739
Did he belong to any clubs
or organizations?

166
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,828
New York Athletic Club.

167
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,206
Would you describe him as loyal?

168
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,203
Excuse me?

169
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,665
By that, we mean
anything that might have given you

170
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,717
doubts about Mr. Draper's
allegiance to the United States.

171
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,137
Any possible ties or sympathies to
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

172
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,589
No, nothing like that.

173
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:17,098
So, do you have any reason to believe
Mr. Draper isn't who he says he is?

174
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,520
What was that? I'm sorry.

175
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,857
It's a standard question.
I know it sounds funny.

176
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,642
No.

177
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,405
It's Mrs. Francis. Are you in?

178
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,818
I'll take it. And, Megan,
can you check on those tickets?

179
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,245
Of course.

180
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,533
-Hello.
-I just spent 40 minutes

181
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,290
-with two men from the government.
-What?

182
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,037
Couldn't you have at least
given me some warning?

183
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,088
Betts, I don't know
what you're talking about.

184
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,425
Well, you applied for
some security clearance,

185
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,002
and they need to know all about you
and I've been through hell, Don.

186
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,632
I'm sick to my stomach.

187
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,304
Hold on.

188
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,179
-What exactly happened?
-What?

189
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,018
Who were they?

190
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,766
Two men from the Defense Department,

191
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,893
and they asked me all kinds
of questions about you.

192
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,277
-About what?
-I don't remember everything.

193
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,865
Your military service, your politics,
your loyalty, your name.

194
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,783
And what did you say?

195
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,787
What do you think I said? Nothing.

196
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,459
Hello? Are you there?

197
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,081
I'm sorry. I...

198
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,252
Jesus.

199
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,254
I didn't know anything about this.

200
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,387
I don't know if
I should even be talking on the phone.

201
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,264
Of course you should.

202
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,225
There's no problem with any of that.

203
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,188
You know,
my husband works for the governor.

204
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,815
You should've told me they were coming.

205
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,324
You're right.
I'm sorry for inconveniencing you.

206
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,531
Okay. Well, goodbye, then.

207
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,080
-Betty.
-Yes?

208
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,831
Thank you.

209
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,925
Megan, have I been contacted by
the Department of Defense?

210
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,636
Yes, of course. There was a form.

211
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,010
-I filled it out, you signed it.
-What?

212
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,477
Two weeks ago. I have it.
Did you want to change something?

213
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,520
-I never looked at it.
-But you signed it.

214
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,223
Why didn't you tell me what it was?

215
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,192
It's standard information.
It's in your employment records.

216
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,987
Just your name, Social Security number,
marital status.

217
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,064
This is very serious, Megan.
I should have been consulted.

218
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,195
We have a contact number.

219
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,777
I'm sure you can change
anything you need to.

220
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,329
Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed.

221
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,906
You're right. You're absolutely right.

222
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,376
If you want to fire me,
I'd understand completely.

223
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,208
Is Mr. Campbell still at lunch?

224
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,923
-Yes.
-Let me know the minute he returns.

225
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,106
Bye.

226
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,695
-How did you get in here?
-I paid someone.

227
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,864
Nigel didn't come. He's not coming.

228
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,497
I'm sorry, baby,
but you can't do what you're doing,

229
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,666
and you can't do what you did last night.

230
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,836
-You're gonna cost me my job.
-I know. I know.

231
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,747
I apologize.

232
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,419
You know that I love you,

233
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,430
my chocolate bunny.

234
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,716
Stop it.

235
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,343
I love you, too.

236
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,470
I just wanted Father to meet you.

237
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,478
Well, that was a silly way to do it.

238
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,101
And I don't know why
you're asking for trouble.

239
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,728
No. You're in my life.

240
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,773
I want him to know why I'm staying.

241
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,948
Why do you have to be so damn dashing?

242
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,787
I'll ring you.

243
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,214
What kind of man are you?

244
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,884
You've used this woman,
and you've ruined her.

245
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,676
Hold on a second...

246
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,598
A man of your age,
only slightly younger than myself,

247
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,970
that you could behave
with such selfishness, such irresponsibility.

248
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,598
We came here for your discretion,
not your judgment.

249
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,983
I know why you came here.

250
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,527
There's a good man, he's not in the city.

251
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:44,031
He has a practice in Morristown. It's $400.

252
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,158
Here.

253
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,740
I don't want it in my handwriting.

254
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,497
Shut the door.

255
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,224
Were you aware that
we applied for a security clearance

256
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,677
to the Department of Defense?

257
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,554
Did that go through already?

258
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,896
Pete.

259
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,856
They interviewed Betty. G-men.

260
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,157
Why did you fill out the form?

261
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,860
Megan did.

262
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,448
And I signed it without looking,
because that's what I do.

263
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,999
What did Betty say?
You've been fine this long.

264
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,499
There's three lies in eight questions here.

265
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,542
If they talk to his family, he was an engineer.
My age is wrong.

266
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,796
Jesus. I didn't even think about it.

267
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,599
I remember you mentioned once.

268
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,347
Don't you have a friend there?

269
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,805
And what's he supposed to do?

270
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:56,812
Stop it. Kill it.
At least find out how far it's gone.

271
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:00,232
Calm down. Let me think.

272
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:07,073
Look, this isn't your problem.
I just want some warning.

273
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,912
Why? What are you gonna do?

274
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,906
Whatever I have to.

275
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,375
You can run the agency without me.

276
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,869
Are you kidding me?

277
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,172
I'll look into it. Immediately. Okay?

278
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,264
I hate this.

279
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,687
Not that I would change anything,
but I hate that it happened.

280
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,315
You know, not the first part, but this.

281
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,691
I understand.

282
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,904
Don't you feel the same way?
I mean, what if this is a sign?

283
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,621
I haven't stopped thinking about you.

284
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,289
Maybe I'm in love with you.

285
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,290
So you want to keep it?

286
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:02,795
No, of course not, but it's just...

287
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,634
I mean, if there's going to be
something between us,

288
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,883
I don't want it to start this way.

289
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,589
Do you? With a scandal?

290
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,091
I see.

291
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,307
But I guess you could keep it.

292
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,639
I mean, when he comes home,
who's gonna know the difference?

293
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,934
Lots of Gls came home to a little surprise.
No one did the math.

294
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:25,230
It wouldn't be my child.
Let's make that clear.

295
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,941
I mean, if he comes home.

296
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,488
Jesus.

297
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,121
-Greg dying is not a solution to this.
-Okay, okay.

298
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,697
I'm desperate.

299
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,158
I'm just trying to think of
what's best for you.

300
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,460
I'm going to take care of it.

301
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,211
Well... Whatever you want.

302
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,678
I'll take care of it, obviously.

303
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,180
-When?
-Immediately.

304
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,633
And I don't want you to come.

305
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,803
You sure? At least let me drive you.

306
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,806
We shouldn't be seen together.

307
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,643
I don't need you to come.

308
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,777
Look, I'm sorry I missed dinner.

309
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,988
It's fine, Henry. I know that you're working.

310
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,704
Don't say it like that.

311
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,252
I'm just tired. it's late.

312
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,770
I have to tell you something.

313
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,896
Two men came from the FBI today.

314
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,979
What?

315
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,403
They interviewed me for 45 minutes
about Don.

316
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,447
Why?

317
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,574
Some kind of security clearance.

318
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,955
Really?

319
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,664
Well, that's what they do.

320
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,586
Is that what you're upset about?

321
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,171
Please don't make me feel silly.

322
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,341
I didn't know if
I was allowed to say anything.

323
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,672
You can always tell me.

324
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:15,552
And if everything goes as I hope,

325
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,555
one day you may be
talking to those people on my behalf.

326
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,603
I just wanted you to know they were here,

327
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,769
because I don't...

328
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,440
Well, I don't want any secrets.

329
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,063
Okay.

330
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,614
I've got it.

331
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,462
Take the next one.

332
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:53,878
He's looking into it.

333
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,717
How many people does he have to talk to?

334
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,758
If you're asking
if he knows how to keep a secret,

335
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,764
he works for the Department of Defense.

336
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,937
But he talks to you?

337
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,265
It's going to be okay.
I was thinking about this,

338
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,476
and I know it'll be uncomfortable,
but if we have to, we can ride it out.

339
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,774
-Are you crazy?
-This many years later?

340
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,571
It must be past the statute of limitations.

341
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,193
It's desertion.

342
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,738
There's no statute of limitations.

343
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,821
I thought nobody cared about these things.

344
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,076
What am I supposed to do?

345
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,622
I don't know. You've been doing it for years.

346
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,920
I don't have to live
with your shit over my head.

347
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,382
You know, I signed this account
after you disappeared in California.

348
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,807
It's taken three years,
but I've grown it from cocktails to $4 million.

349
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:42,010
Get rid of it.

350
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,652
Good morning. Mr. Keller is here.
Would you like some coffee?

351
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,729
No, thank you.

352
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,196
I appreciate you seeing me
on such short notice.

353
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,785
Well, you said you couldn't
discuss it over the phone,

354
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,487
so I assume it's serious.

355
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,246
Well...

356
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,752
I'm interested in setting up
some kind of trust for my kids.

357
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:13,378
Well, starting from when?
Eighteen years old? Twenty-one years old?

358
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,629
Now.

359
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:20,223
And I want it to be the kind of account
their mother can access.

360
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,926
Don, why would she need anything?

361
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,305
Look,

362
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,433
if circumstances conspire,

363
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,647
she'll know why.

364
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,647
I don't like this. I don't like this at all.

365
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:36,902
An emergency meeting and... I'll be honest.
You seem very edgy.

366
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,699
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

367
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,737
It just ran through my mind that
maybe I'm not prepared.

368
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,870
I know this has been hard on you,
the divorce, but don't go spinning.

369
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,501
Everybody has bad dreams
every once in a while.

370
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,924
The wound is still fresh. It'll heal in time.

371
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:58,754
Just tell me that you'll do that,
and I'll sleep better.

372
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:04,847
Okay, but I'll tell you,
I don't like hearing that tone in your voice.

373
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,893
Don't worry. I'm fine.

374
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,689
Now, please tell me
you're shtupping that girl out there.

375
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,982
Hillary.

376
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,870
Are you sure you don't want me to come in?

377
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,329
Are you all right?

378
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,000
Yes.

379
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,837
I'm sure I will be in a minute.

380
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,173
She's 17 years old. What do I say to her?

381
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,342
I had her when I was 15, and I don't regret it,

382
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,140
but she seems so much younger.

383
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,520
She's very beautiful.

384
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,560
Thank you.

385
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,819
She is.

386
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,659
I'm sorry.

387
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,079
There's no one to talk to.

388
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,532
I understand.

389
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,998
Thank you for being so sweet.

390
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,875
How old is your daughter?

391
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,222
I'm sorry. I shouldn't pry.

392
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,135
Fifteen.

393
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,448
Dr. Miller is here to see you.

394
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,446
Send her in.

395
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,370
I owe you a phone call, don't I?

396
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,080
Yes, you do.

397
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,457
Are you all right? What happened?

398
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:46,838
I've been snowed under. I should've called.
I should've called today. I have to cancel.

399
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,757
You look sick.

400
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,849
-You have a fever.
-Yeah, I haven't been feeling well.

401
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,940
-Let me take you home.
-I'll be fine.

402
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,019
Come on, get your coat.

403
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,032
This pretty young thing,
she didn't know which way to turn

404
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,209
with my father on one end of the hall
and my uncle on the other.

405
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,496
Should've tried that move at Gettysburg.

406
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,707
My grandpa fought in the Civil War.

407
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,088
Really? Where did he surrender?

408
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:27,924
He never surrendered.

409
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,473
That man could turn
going to the shitter into a parade.

410
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,386
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting this.

411
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,803
Why would you do that?

412
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,939
Sometimes a fella's gotta pick up the check.

413
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,815
Since when?

414
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:50,280
You know that I like you, Roger.
Hell, you're a genuine character.

415
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,746
I'm sorry. That's the long and the short of it.

416
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,960
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

417
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,337
It's over.

418
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,790
I'm sorry.

419
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,834
Are you kidding me?

420
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:16,185
Are you trying to kill me? Is that your plan?

421
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,013
If you want to put us through our paces,

422
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,645
we will shake heaven and earth for you.
You know that.

423
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,527
Just tell me it's for show beforehand,
because, I swear, you're going to kill me.

424
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,280
Roger, it wasn't my decision.

425
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,819
Since Daddy's incapacitation,

426
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,073
the board has been more aggressive,

427
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,248
and that's never been my bailiwick.
You know that.

428
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:41,544
But they want to consolidate everything.
One agency, one rate,

429
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,421
all the ad work, all the brands.

430
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,462
So fine, let's.... You know what?

431
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,218
Get Draper in a room with them.
Where do they want to go?

432
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,171
Where do you think? BBDO.

433
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,632
You think you'll get the kind of attention
you get at Sterling Cooper?

434
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,217
Well, you're not Sterling Cooper anymore.

435
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,723
That's right.
We're better, and We're devoted to you.

436
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:02,732
Oh, hell. I don't want you to think
this is for cause. There's no reason.

437
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,650
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing you could do.

438
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,399
It's just the way it is.

439
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,814
Wait. This is not happening.

440
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:15,278
You don't just end business with people
after 25... 30 years!

441
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,362
We're family.

442
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,246
I invited you to my daughter's wedding.

443
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:22,702
I don't know
why you didn't get the invitation.

444
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,661
You should fire your secretary
is what you should do,

445
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:25,917
not fire your agency!

446
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,465
We're dead. You know that.

447
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,885
The question is when?

448
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,682
We're gonna call for the files on Monday.

449
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,810
No, you can't do that. I'm begging you.

450
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,309
You can't do that.
You've gotta give me some time.

451
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,816
I told you, Roger. It's done.

452
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,855
You're not gonna win these fellas over.

453
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,275
-Give me 30 days.
-What's that gonna do?

454
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:54,108
After all the lies I've told for you,
you owe me that!

455
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,739
I don't owe you squat.

456
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,619
You inherited this account.

457
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,292
Thirty days.

458
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,754
Keep it under your hat.

459
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,833
Give me a chance to get our affairs in order.

460
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,719
I'm begging you.

461
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,971
Okay. I can do that.

462
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,142
Thank you.

463
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,204
No hard feelings.

464
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,361
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

465
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,206
I'm really sorry.
We're looking for the Vernons.

466
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,000
I don't know them.

467
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,712
-Is this 110 Waverly?
-No.

468
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,457
What'd I tell you? Sorry about that.

469
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,722
-Are you all right?
-Don't...

470
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,011
I'm gonna get you a glass of water.
Sit down.

471
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,356
Are you all right?

472
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,032
I think I'm having a heart attack.

473
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:02,202
Are you in pain? Is it in your chest?

474
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,405
No, but I can't breathe.

475
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,752
Stop it. Please, don't touch me.

476
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,010
If there's no pain,
you're not having a heart attack.

477
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,929
You're not a real doctor.

478
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,224
My father has a heart condition.
I've been through this, okay?

479
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,560
You should go.

480
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:31,106
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not leaving you like this.

481
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,795
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Father. Do come in.

482
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:03,138
Father, come with me.
I'd like you to meet someone.

483
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,886
Properly this time.

484
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,889
Toni Charles, this is my father Robert Pryce.

485
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,437
-How do you do?
-A pleasure to meet you again.

486
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,107
How are you Ending the city?
Are you enjoying yourself?

487
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,017
I am.

488
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,897
Very well, then. What do you say
we all head to dinner and get acquainted?

489
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,826
As delightful as that sounds,
I'm afraid I'm traveling tomorrow.

490
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,115
I'm terribly sorry.

491
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,160
Well, that's too bad.

492
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:33,745
But please, go on ahead.
I don't want to ruin your evening.

493
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,216
Well, of course.

494
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,262
Toni, why don't you run along ahead,
and I'll join you in a bit?

495
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,508
Don't want to lose our reservation.

496
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:49,472
Well, it was a pleasure to meet you.
Lane said so many nice things about you.

497
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,102
Yes.

498
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,858
I'll be right along, darling.

499
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,491
Come along. Out with it.

500
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,039
I see your face.

501
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,130
Are you more distraught that
I found someone I love,

502
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,332
or that she's a negro?

503
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,300
You're coming home, Lane.

504
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,469
I'm afraid I've moved on!

505
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,395
Put your home in order.

506
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,643
Either there, or here.

507
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,187
You will not live in between.

508
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,495
What was that?

509
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,613
Yes.

510
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,740
What was that?

511
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,251
Yes, sir.

512
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,689
Darling, what's wrong?

513
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,655
I can't tell you.

514
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,996
Peter, look at me.

515
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,254
Is there something I should know?

516
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:46,134
Trudy, no. it's nothing to do with you.
Come here.

517
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,393
You should talk to me. You'll feel better.

518
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,572
How is it that
some people just walk through life,

519
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:11,402
dragging their lies with them,
destroying everything they touch?

520
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,533
-Who are you talking about?
-I loathe it.

521
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,581
No one ever knows.

522
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,833
Except the honest people
who have to pick up the pieces.

523
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,418
I don't know what you're talking about,

524
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,298
and I want to.

525
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,879
No, you don't.

526
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,889
And I don't want you to.

527
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,390
You can tell me anything.

528
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,890
What was that?

529
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,903
Just a kick. He's turning over. Feel.

530
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,828
Just remember, everything's good here.

531
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,889
No, we don't go to East Hampton anymore.
We go to Southampton.

532
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,350
It's a rental, but it's a beaut.

533
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,055
So listen, it's been wonderful catching up,

534
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,437
but I have to admit
I'm calling for Larry, actually.

535
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,066
What?

536
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,071
No.

537
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:35,243
God, I'm so sorry to hear that.

538
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,574
When did that happen?

539
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,997
I mean,

540
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,995
when did he go?

541
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,122
I mean, what happened?

542
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,803
Louise, I'm so sorry.

543
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,091
I obviously didn't know.
I must've been out of town.

544
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:10,361
Do you want something to help you sleep?
I might have a Valium.

545
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,698
Why didn't you tell me that two hours ago?

546
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:17,198
I don't know. I just thought of it.
I never take them.

547
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,798
Thank you for staying.

548
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,961
I don't know what happened.

549
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,631
I think you do.

550
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,137
Those men,

551
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,679
who did you think they were?

552
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,897
I'm so tired.

553
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:49,188
Please, tell me what's wrong.

554
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,979
It's me.

555
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,320
I'm tired of running.

556
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,740
Running from what?

557
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,535
In Korea, I was wounded,

558
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,629
but this other man was killed,
and they mixed us up.

559
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,386
I wanted them to.

560
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,100
And I

561
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,022
just kept living

562
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,899
as him.

563
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,568
Oh, my goodness.

564
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,444
Yup.

565
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,571
But, now, I think that's over.

566
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,786
What happened?

567
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,668
North American Aviation
told the government

568
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,871
they need to know who I am.

569
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,010
What are you gonna do?

570
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,428
There's nothing to do.

571
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,015
Well, can't you get a lawyer?

572
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,016
You were a kid.

573
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,763
Turn yourself in,
have someone plead for clemency.

574
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:10,807
It's not that simple.

575
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,567
There are things you can do.

576
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,063
I shouldn't have told you,

577
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,901
but I'm just so damn tired of all of it.

578
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,871
Hey,

579
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,790
I'm glad you told me.

580
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:58,196
I don't want to talk at the office,
and I don't want to talk over the phone.

581
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,332
Come in.

582
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,348
I spoke to Russ,

583
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,980
and you haven't been flagged.

584
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:38,103
And if we end things with NAA,
the investigation will stop where it is.

585
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,982
Thank God.

586
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,567
So I walk away from $4 million,

587
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:47,621
and I just keep this to myself, because why?

588
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,198
Because you can't live in the open?

589
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,580
You don't know any other way.

590
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,123
I come here unannounced and
there's another thing I don't want to know.

591
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:02,506
Tell NAA we want Martin Marietta or Hughes.

592
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,506
And what do I tell the partners?

593
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,579
I called your house a hundred times
last night.

594
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,211
I'm fine. Everything went fine.

595
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,379
Should you even be here?
Should you be on your feet?

596
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,006
Roger.

597
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,716
Oh, God. I wish I could hold you right now.

598
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:52,556
It's okay. I feel good.

599
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:54,850
I feel awful.

600
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,356
We avoided a tragedy.

601
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,518
What? Yeah.

602
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,485
We have a partners meeting.

603
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,738
Christ. Really?

604
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,988
Come on. Life goes on.

605
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,539
You're so beautiful.

606
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,381
-Gentlemen.
-Morning.

607
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,739
Let me call to order
a meeting of the partners. In attendance...

608
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,821
Get on with it.

609
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,912
I don't know how to explain it,
but I have some serious news.

610
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,124
North American Aviation is moving on.

611
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,372
What happened?

612
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:06,877
There was a misunderstanding.
Some names were left off of a document.

613
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:11,635
A General was insulted.
I apologized, but the damage was done.

614
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,474
Well, that's just great.

615
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:14,975
What General?

616
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,687
Unfortunately, this is irreparable.

617
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,431
How can that be?

618
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,644
Because I didn't pay enough attention.

619
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,320
That's your only damn job.

620
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,944
I swear, when I think
what we're trying to do here,

621
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,569
when all you had to do
is hold their hands and jerk 'em off.

622
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,783
Is that so hard to do, Campbell?

623
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,289
We have to come in here and
have this catastrophe dropped into our lap

624
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,711
because you don't know
what the hell you're doing,

625
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,254
-because you fucked up!
-Hey!

626
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,581
Roger.

627
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,342
That's the business we're in,
accounts come in, accounts go out.

628
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,346
Roger, I think you should apologize.

629
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,560
I'm sorry.

630
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,150
I have an announcement.

631
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,776
I'm going to be taking a leave of absence.
Two weeks, perhaps a month,

632
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,859
to return to London and tend to my family.

633
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,785
I shall be reachable by telex and telephone.

634
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:18,911
And I can say with full confidence
that the company is in a state of stability,

635
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,368
even with this morning's news.

636
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,920
And all matters financial
may be referred to Mrs. Harris.

637
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,799
Very well, then.

638
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:42,230
I'm sorry.

639
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,521
Is there more business?

640
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,230
Shall we go down
