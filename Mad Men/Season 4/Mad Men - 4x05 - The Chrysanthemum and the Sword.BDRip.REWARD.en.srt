1
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,469
Donald Draper's office.

2
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,854
In addition to the two major cough drop
users, smokers and cold sufferers,

3
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,693
is another group that eats them as candy.

4
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,237
The technical term is "hypochondriacs."

5
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,610
Donald Draper.

6
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,001
Donald Draper's office.

7
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,619
Hello?

8
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,792
You said not to buzz you all the time,
but I don't know how else to do this.

9
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,251
You have a phone call.

10
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,006
You can buzz me for a phone call.

11
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,803
Things like coffee after I've said no,
you don't have to ask again.

12
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,884
You're always asleep in here.

13
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,345
Walter Hoffman from The Times.
He's a reporter.

14
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:35,971
What's it regarding?

15
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,564
You want me to go ask?

16
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,277
I think we're done here.

17
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,522
New York Times.

18
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,944
This is Don.

19
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,701
Hi. it's Walter Hoffman
from The New York Times.

20
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,497
I write the advertising column.

21
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,125
I know who you are.
What can I do for you, Walter?

22
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,501
I just wanted to know if you'd heard

23
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,955
that Cutler Gleason and Chaough
just signed Clearasil.

24
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,130
I don't keep track of accounts
once we resign them.

25
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,461
I just think it's kind of interesting

26
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,299
that first CGC takes the Jai Alai
Association from you and now this.

27
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,975
-How do you explain it?
-I don't think about it.

28
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,019
Well, I talked to Ted Chaough

29
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,849
and he said, "Every time Don Draper
looks in his rearview mirror, he sees me."

30
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,480
You have a partners' luncheon.

31
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,560
What's your point?

32
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,817
My point is do you have a response?

33
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,113
On the record?

34
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,190
Please.

35
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,026
I've never heard of him.

36
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,827
Anything else?

37
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,789
No. Have a good day.

38
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,380
This Selma thing is not going away.

39
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,380
You still don't think
they need a civil rights law?

40
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,629
They got what they wanted.
Why aren't they happy?

41
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,260
Because Lassie
stays at the Waldorf and they can't.

42
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,008
Please tell me I missed everything.

43
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,852
I now call to order a meeting of the partners,

44
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,806
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
In attendance...

45
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,310
Everybody.

46
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,147
Very well then, Mr. Campbell.

47
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:09,278
Secor Laxative has finally agreed to produce
a television commercial and test market it.

48
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,535
How'd you ease them into it?
Must've had to loosen them up first.

49
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,576
We've had that client for 18 years, Roger.

50
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,991
Pete has other news.

51
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,711
A Deerfield chum of mine
roped me into a dinner for the Asia Society,

52
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,127
the result of which was a series
of interesting phone calls and one lunch

53
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,675
regarding the Honda Motorcycle Company.

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,593
They control over 50% of the US market.

55
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,930
I've seen them. They're cute.

56
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,220
They're miserable at Grey.

57
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,392
Well, 50% of the market, who wouldn't be?

58
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,435
"Where's my other half?"

59
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:44,141
They're taking meetings and as of 9:00
this morning, we're on the books.

60
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,568
Three million dollars in potential billings,

61
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,771
and they're venturing
into automobiles as well.

62
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,896
When can you bring them in?

63
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,903
Listen, let me spare you the agony
and the ecstasy

64
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,485
and tell you we are not doing business
with them.

65
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,236
Excuse me?

66
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,615
Look, I don't expect you to understand this,
because you were a little boy,

67
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,830
but I used to be a man with a lot of friends.

68
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,955
Then World War II came and they were
all Killed by your new yellow buddies.

69
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,464
Look,

70
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,633
if Bernbach can do business
with Volkswagen,

71
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,055
we can do business with anybody.

72
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,719
The war is over, Roger.

73
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,721
Why don't we just bring
Dr. Lyle Evans in here?

74
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,268
That'll be enough of that.

75
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,724
Lucky Strike is great. Meeting adjourned.

76
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,067
We don't usually put new business to a vote,
do we?

77
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,452
Does anyone really
have a problem with this?

78
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,279
No. When can you bring them in?

79
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,411
Immediately, if possible.
I don't want to lose our spot.

80
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,165
So far I've been advised to read
The Chrysanthemum and the Sword.

81
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,497
From what I can tell,
they have their own way of doing business.

82
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,050
Bert, I'm hoping you'll help us
navigate these waters?

83
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,050
I'll prepare a few salient points.
Keep Roger out of the loop.

84
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,849
Another rather exciting possibility.

85
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,017
Good work.

86
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,016
Joan, get everybody that book.

87
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,096
I at least want them
to see it on people's desks.

88
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,858
Who the hell is Dr. Lyle Evans?

89
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,731
I have no idea.

90
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,984
The body of a 38-year-old Unitarian minister

91
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,783
was cremated within hours
of his death last night.

92
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,657
He had been clubbed by white men
who resented his coming to Selma

93
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,989
-to join negro civil rights demonstrations.
-Come in.

94
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,792
-Hi.
-Hi.

95
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,786
Sally?

96
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,704
Hello.

97
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,957
I brought my doctor kit.

98
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,929
Okay, I'm gonna go.

99
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,141
Enjoy yourself. Which one is it?

100
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,682
I mean, which restaurant,
in case I need to reach you.

101
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,054
Benihana's.

102
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,481
You're going to see a girl, aren't you?

103
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:49,809
Yes, I am.

104
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,064
-What's her name?
-Bethany.

105
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,687
I don't like that.

106
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,651
Well, you don't have to.

107
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,028
Bed by 9:00?

108
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,658
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.

109
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,214
Jesus. What did you do?

110
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,595
You look like a mongoloid.

111
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,968
-Is it that bad?
-Bobby, go to bed.

112
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,264
Sally, get over here.

113
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,466
No.

114
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,477
Good night.

115
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,308
Come over here.

116
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,483
I'm not mad. Come on.

117
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,827
Your dad is gonna kill me.

118
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,789
He's actually gonna kill me.

119
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,325
You have short hair and Daddy likes it.

120
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,542
That doesn't matter.

121
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,792
You're not allowed to do this
and you know that.

122
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,082
Are you and Daddy doing it?

123
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,212
What?

124
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,506
I know what it is.

125
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,925
I know that the man pees inside the woman.

126
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,052
Where did you hear that?

127
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,849
A girl at school.

128
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,310
You should talk to your mommy.

129
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,853
I don't want to.

130
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,479
You don't need to know right now,
so stop changing the subject.

131
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,900
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,942
Do you understand
I'm in worse trouble than you are?

133
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,700
I just wanted to look pretty.

134
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,537
Come on.

135
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,825
We're gonna try and fix this, okay?

136
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,555
You're not impressed.

137
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,554
-My hair smells like I've been frying chicken.
-It does?

138
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,010
Stop it.

139
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,930
This place is very expensive.

140
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,732
That's not it. it's just not very intimate.

141
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,649
Three dates in five months?
Don't think I don't know why.

142
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,522
If it isn't the inscrutable Don Draper.

143
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,691
Ted.

144
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,786
-This is my wife Nan.
-This is my friend Bethany.

145
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,987
Ted Chaough.

146
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,369
-Don Draper.
-Pleasure.

147
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,449
Pleasure.

148
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,537
We just booked Howard Moses to shoot
Clearasil. Have you ever worked with him?

149
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,545
Not yet.

150
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,757
I thought I was clever,
but it looks like you and I had the same idea.

151
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,084
What are you talking about?

152
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,840
What do you think? Honda?

153
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,215
You think the rest of these tourists
are from J Walter Thompson?

154
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,636
I suppose it's possible.

155
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,844
Well, the good news is,
I think it's gonna be between us.

156
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,020
The bad news is the best man's gonna win.

157
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,269
Enjoy your dinner.

158
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,567
-We will.
-Nice to meet you.

159
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,898
-What are you doing, Ted?
-My job.

160
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,076
-Who's he?
-Some fly I keep swatting away.

161
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,457
They haven't done half of what we have.

162
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,037
The minute he declared himself
the competition, suddenly we were equal.

163
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,212
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
he's no competition at all.

164
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,424
Hello?

165
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,220
We're not gonna let this
spoil our evening, are we?

166
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,972
No.

167
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,103
-Do you know how to use those?
-Yes.

168
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,570
You think you could teach me?

169
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:38,086
-What time did they go to bed?
-I'm really, really sorry.

170
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,919
-They still up?
-No.

171
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:46,549
It's just, I was watching I V with Bobby
and I turned around for a second

172
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,380
and Sally cut her hair.

173
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:49,923
What?

174
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,183
It's pretty bad.

175
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,098
I could've just left them alone.

176
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:58,774
-She was in the bathroom. I didn't know.
-You're supposed to watch them.

177
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,479
Don't.

178
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,978
I finally got her to sleep.

179
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,906
Do you know the river of shit
I'm gonna get from her mother?

180
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,318
I'm sorry about that. I tried to fix it,

181
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,698
but you'll probably
need to take her to the beauty parlor.

182
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,413
Why the hell did she do that?

183
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,663
She probably wanted to look older
like Hayley Mills.

184
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,329
I don't know. I really shouldn't.

185
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,338
Consider it severance.

186
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,508
-Look...
-I don't want your advice, okay?

187
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,385
Good night.

188
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,069
It's probably the kids.

189
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,951
Hi, Mom.

190
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,707
-Did you have a nice time?
-Yeah.

191
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,756
Take that hat off.

192
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,182
Let me explain, okay?

193
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,134
-What the hell happened to you?
-Calm down.

194
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,469
-You cut her hair?
-No.

195
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,137
I cut it. I'm sorry...

196
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,392
-Hey!
-Betty.

197
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,815
It was an accident.

198
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,360
Jesus. Betts, is that necessary?

199
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,274
I'm really, really sorry.

200
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,821
Damn right you're sorry.
Get up to your room.

201
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,695
-Hold on.
-No, now.

202
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,735
It'll be okay.

203
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,701
Bobby, take your
little brother outside and play.

204
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,119
You didn't have to hit her.

205
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,335
You're right, because it doesn't do anything!

206
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,508
You have picture day.

207
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,177
-And forget about your sleepover.
-Kids do this.

208
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,180
-You never did this?
-All I wanted was to have long hair.

209
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,268
In fact when my mother was mad at me,
she would threaten to cut my hair.

210
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,186
-Where the hell were you?
-Look, it just happened.

211
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,638
The sitter wasn't paying attention.

212
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,898
You know what?
I don't want to know about your life.

213
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,147
You can't even watch them for a second.
it's like leaving them with nobody.

214
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,275
Because you're so good with them?

215
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,482
Take her to the hairdresser.

216
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,525
Goodbye.

217
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,078
-Betty.
-Henry, I don't want to hear it.

218
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,335
I want him dead!

219
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,917
You don't think I feel that?

220
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,500
I was divorced, Betty.

221
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,128
My weekends with Ellie were sacrosanct.

222
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,636
I probably paid for a building in playland
and he couldn't take a night off?

223
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:41,220
And who knows who he had watching her?
Some secretary, another whore?

224
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,017
But...

225
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,108
That's him, not Sally.

226
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:53,490
And little girls do do this,
and not just ones from broken homes.

227
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,326
I know.

228
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,449
I was impulsive.

229
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,162
I'll apologize.

230
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,828
Having had a girl this age,

231
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,506
I can tell you that punishment
will only make this worse.

232
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,336
So maybe, when you're apologizing,

233
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,847
you let her know she's going to go
to the hairdresser

234
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,266
and she can go on her sleepover.

235
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,886
Reward her? Really?

236
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,721
Really.

237
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,239
You're soft, you know that?

238
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,868
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
May I help you?

239
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:50,372
There you are. The Honda meeting's today,
and before you bite my head off,

240
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,753
I'm up to date on the protocol
with the help of Cooper

241
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:56,378
and we don't have to do anything
but avoid criticizing them or giving advice.

242
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,588
I ran into Ted Chaough.

243
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,974
How are they in this thing
and how could you not know that?

244
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,471
This guy's drafting off of us.

245
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,724
For the record, it's JWT, CGC and us.

246
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,728
Now if you don't mind,
I have to get some gifts wrapped

247
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,854
and get these chrysanthemums
out of the building.

248
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,560
Apparently they symbolize death.

249
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,238
So much conflicting information.

250
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,903
Allow me to show you around.

251
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,824
Our offices are probably more modern
than you've seen,

252
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,502
but that's the kind
of company we are, forward-thinking.

253
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,800
This is what we call the creative lounge.

254
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,345
We can't tell you how it happens,
but it does happen here.

255
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,506
This is too difficult.

256
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,591
Well, tell them something.

257
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,017
This is Joan Harris, our chief hostess.

258
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,271
I'd like you to meet
Ichiro Kamura and Hachi Saito.

259
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,025
Nice to meet you.
I hope no one's taken you to Benihana.

260
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,114
David Ogilvy.

261
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,777
I've got a very good list of steakhouses.
Just ask.

262
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,835
Not very subtle, are they?

263
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,004
No, they are not.

264
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:20,345
We are most happily
looking forward to presentation.

265
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,888
Not now, I hope.

266
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,678
We want more driver for motorcycle.

267
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,021
And we shall endeavor to make that happen.

268
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:36,820
And now that we are finished,
please accept our modest gifts.

269
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,989
I cannot accept.

270
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,400
A small token.

271
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,245
No, thank you.

272
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,991
Please. You are our guests.

273
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,000
Thank you.

274
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,251
-Open it.
-No.

275
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,332
Later, of course.

276
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,339
It's a cantaloupe.

277
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,302
Johnnie Walker Red.

278
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,062
Thank you very much.

279
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,181
Thank you.

280
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,610
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,439
I didn't know this meeting was happening.

282
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,616
Then again,
I know how some people love surprises.

283
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,241
I apologize, gentlemen,
but for some reason I was not informed.

284
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,872
In fact, someone set a long lunch for me
with Randolph.

285
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:34,544
Well, it was last minute
and now, unfortunately, drawn to a close.

286
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,374
I have to warn you they won't know
it's over until you drop the big one.

287
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,457
Twice.

288
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,258
The meeting is not over.

289
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,757
We have yet to present the rules.

290
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,846
So now you're dictating terms.

291
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,015
Mr. Kamura, Mr. Saito, this is Roger Sterling.

292
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,564
And this is their translator, Akira Takahashi.

293
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:05,609
We give each firm $3,000

294
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,412
for a competitive presentation.

295
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,832
In this packet
are the conditions for the competition.

296
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,161
We don't want any conditions.
We want it to be unconditional.

297
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,376
Akira, go ahead, tell them what I said.

298
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,425
Roger, stop it. These men are our guests.

299
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,550
I know exactly who these men are.

300
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,845
You think you can just come in here
and we'll fawn all over you?

301
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,469
We beat you and we'll beat you again.

302
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,474
And we don't want any of your Jap crap.

303
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,016
So, sayonara.

304
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,443
If you could only know my embarrassment.

305
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,778
His wife's very sick. He's been drinking a lot.

306
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,835
You have our rules.

307
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,796
We very much look forward
to your presentation.

308
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,723
You don't get to kill this account.

309
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,559
You know how they are. Maybe it'll kill itself.

310
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,605
Enough.

311
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,024
I'm not even talking about money right now.

312
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,318
I'm talking about the kind of work
you could do for those people.

313
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,270
Have you seen that motorcycle?
They love design.

314
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,108
As long as my name's in that lobby,
I get to choose whom I do business with.

315
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,693
And I've got a lot better reasons
than you had with Jantzen.

316
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,286
Jantzen was over.

317
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,455
Well, I made a pledge to a lot of men
you'll never meet

318
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,328
not to do business with them.

319
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,659
Christ on a cracker, where do you get off?

320
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,166
You know what? You weren't there.
You weren't anywhere.

321
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,713
I'm sorry you can't understand.

322
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,335
It's been almost 20 years

323
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,339
and whether you like it or not,
the world has moved on.

324
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:48,840
These are not the same people.

325
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,717
How could that be? I'm the same people!

326
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,307
You don't think I know what you're doing?

327
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,759
You're wrapping yourself in the flag

328
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,719
so you can keep me
from bringing in an account

329
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,852
because you know that every chip I make,
we become less dependent on Lucky Strike

330
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,933
and therefore less dependent on you.

331
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,694
-Why, you little shit!
-Roger!

332
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,532
Get him out of here.

333
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,321
The rest of us are trying to build something.

334
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,161
He's right.

335
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,505
You know what to do.

336
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,886
Where would you hide a coin?
You'd spend it, wouldn't you?

337
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,097
I do know where it is. I'll tell you.

338
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,725
-Then tell me.
-I'll make a bargain with you.

339
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,232
Let these two go. Keep me. I'll tell you.

340
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,900
-Promise.
-No.

341
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,076
Then no deal.

342
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,746
What if you won't tell me where that coin is?

343
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,247
I refuse to talk in this...

344
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,591
What are you doing?

345
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,093
Nothing.

346
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,469
Laura.

347
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,521
Someone else was here...

348
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,768
Go upstairs.

349
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,157
Hold Still. I'll get it.

350
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,539
What's the problem? Is she sick?
I would've come and gotten her.

351
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,297
No. The slumber party ended early.

352
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,552
I'd like to speak to Betty.

353
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,675
Okay. Honey?

354
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,184
Is everything all right?

355
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,179
No, it's not.

356
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,603
Could you leave us alone for a moment?

357
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,820
I found Sally behaving inappropriately.

358
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,694
What'd she do?

359
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:22,373
She was in our den on the couch
playing with herself.

360
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,417
What?

361
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,246
I don't know what goes on here,

362
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,172
but that kind of behavior
is not allowed in my house

363
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,670
and certainly not
in the presence of my daughter.

364
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,675
I am

365
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:44,183
very sorry for this behavior and so is Sally.

366
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,521
I would've done the same thing.

367
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,270
Well...

368
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,320
I'm sorry about that.

369
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,156
I should go.

370
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,457
What is wrong with you?

371
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,552
You don't do those things.

372
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:21,474
You don't do them in private
and you especially don't do them in public.

373
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,593
You have nothing to say?

374
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,678
I didn't do anything.

375
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,061
Don't you dare lie to me
or I'll cut your fingers off.

376
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,527
Go to bed.
We'll deal with this in the morning.

377
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,191
What happened?

378
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,238
I'm mortified.

379
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,125
I'm so embarrassed.

380
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,745
What happened?

381
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,755
She caught Sally

382
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,590
playing with herself.

383
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,729
What's wrong with her?
That woman will tell everyone.

384
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,941
Why is she doing this?

385
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,397
I told you if it got serious,
there is a solution.

386
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,692
I don't want to do that, Henry.

387
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,860
It's one thing after another.

388
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,786
What's wrong with her?

389
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,699
Maybe it's time
we let a professional answer that question.

390
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,999
Henry,

391
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,373
I went to a psychiatrist once.

392
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,922
What? why?

393
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,632
Because I was unhappy
and I don't think it helps anything.

394
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:52,394
I hate to think how much worse
it would have been for Eleanor without one.

395
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:56,148
They train them just for kids.
We got ours from the school.

396
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,614
I'm saying this not because I'm so sure
there's something wrong with her,

397
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,488
but I think this is very hard on you two.

398
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,115
-When did you go?
-Years ago.

399
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,662
I was bored.

400
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,667
-Can we leave it at that?
-Of course.

401
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,198
Miss Blankenship,
any luck on that call to California?

402
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,359
I'm sorry. No answer

403
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,491
Misters Peters and Pryce to see you.

404
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,789
Send them in.

405
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,123
I think we're okay,
but everything they do is inside out.

406
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,705
I got a call this morning
from my contact there, Masao,

407
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:00,883
telling me that the meeting
was a Margaret Dumont-sized disaster,

408
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,877
but then... Lane?

409
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,300
Then, nearly 20 minutes later, Masao called
me and set a time for our presentation.

410
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,843
Look, there's probably a guy like Roger
at every firm.

411
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,849
They've outgrown it and we haven't.

412
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,140
Roger has something to say.

413
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,062
Mn Cooper and Mn Sterling.

414
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,950
I realize that I should not, at this point,
limit our potential clients in any way.

415
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,828
Next account, no matter what it is,
you'll have my full support.

416
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,995
And?

417
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:37,829
Look, I know it's an old one and I
have to let it go just for my health alone,

418
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,544
and, well, hell, it's over.

419
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,217
Your contrition wouldn't have gotten you
out of this, but you're lucky.

420
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,842
They called us today
and gave us an appointment anyway.

421
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,467
That means nothing.

422
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,017
-it's over.
-No, Bert, I said we have a meeting.

423
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,689
It's most likely that they are expecting us
to come in and resign.

424
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,984
How do you get there from here?

425
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:03,525
Have we received a gift?

426
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,154
-We should have gotten one yesterday.
-I haven't.

427
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,870
Miss Blankenship,
have I received any packages today?

428
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,992
Yes.

429
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,791
Could you bring it in, please?

430
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,466
It says "Don" on it.

431
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,294
Give it to him.

432
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,645
"Help me, Honda. Help. Help me, Honda.
Love, Teddy Chaough."

433
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,193
-So, there is no gift.
-That's how they work.

434
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:46,022
They want us to go in there, bow down
and beg them to chop our heads off

435
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,403
because we disgraced ourselves.
How could you admire these animals?

436
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,861
Would you shut up? They're businessmen
and you insulted them to their face.

437
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,537
I'm expecting a child.

438
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,909
Jai Alai, Clearasil, now Honda.

439
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,252
Chaough wins another one by default.

440
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,544
He's not going to win.

441
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,502
I'm not wasting that appointment.

442
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,001
We need to do something
that will make them notice us. Fireworks.

443
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,507
-Do you have a campaign?
-No.

444
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,722
But I will and we're gonna
shoot a whole commercial for it.

445
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,432
Something outrageous, something graphic.

446
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,181
The rules limit us to boards and copy.

447
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,645
It specifically says, "No finished work."

448
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,893
Because no one's ever won an account
by breaking the rules?

449
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,225
Not with the Japanese.

450
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,436
You're trying to tell me if we put our backs
into this thing,

451
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,566
we couldn't turn their heads?

452
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,989
Three thousand dollars is all we have.

453
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,072
That should buy
about four seconds of your commercial.

454
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,236
You don't think it's worth
going out of pocket?

455
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,366
What pocket?

456
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:40,126
A spec commercial will eat up our ability
to pitch any more new business this year.

457
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,619
And it's only March.

458
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,750
I would be willing to risk
bankrupting this place

459
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,207
if I didn't think
we were already dead in the water.

460
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,751
But we are.

461
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,382
Come on, Bert.

462
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,653
Hello?

463
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,525
Am I catching you alone?

464
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,570
What do you want?

465
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,655
I prefer not to talk about this on the phone,

466
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,538
but it's our feeling
that Sally needs to see a psychiatrist.

467
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,452
"Our feeling."

468
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,038
Why, because she cut her hair?

469
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,839
No, it's more serious this time,

470
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:30,964
and I'm telling you because I found
someone through the school.

471
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,465
A children specialist.

472
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,594
What exactly did she do?
She set the house on fire?

473
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,725
She was masturbating, Don,
in front of a friend.

474
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,348
Does that seem normal to you?

475
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,104
Really?

476
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,148
Boy or girl?

477
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,484
Jesus. What's the difference?

478
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,693
The doctor needs to speak with us,
individually of course.

479
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,529
So you've made up your mind.
Why are you even calling me?

480
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,111
She's out of control.
I thought you'd be concerned.

481
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,617
I am.
I just don't know that she needs a doctor.

482
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,788
Can't you talk to her?

483
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,500
You think I want this?
I don't know what else to do.

484
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,669
You know what kind of little girls do that?

485
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,711
Fast ones.

486
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:07,913
She's 10 years old.

487
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,373
Well, don't think she doesn't understand.

488
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,254
She understands a lot of things,
thanks to you.

489
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:12,960
What?

490
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,466
I don't care what you do,
but just don't do it with her there.

491
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:18,348
You brought another man
into your bed, into her house.

492
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,762
You don't think she noticed that?

493
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,433
One man, Don. How many have you had
in your bachelor pad?

494
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,982
That girl you had watching her? Who's she?
I'm married.

495
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,767
Jesus. You ever hear yourself?

496
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,437
I'll give the information to your secretary.

497
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,318
-Perfect.
-Good night.

498
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,964
Yes!

499
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,179
Have you seen these?
I'm trying to figure out what makes it work.

500
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,178
I'm still wondering what makes you work.

501
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,551
Joan, Pete, Peggy.

502
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:09,191
Don't touch it.
I want to see how long it goes.

503
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,909
What's wrong?

504
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,666
"A man is shamed
by being openly ridiculed and rejected.

505
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,375
"It requires an audience."

506
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,541
What is that? Fortune cookie?

507
00:30:29,703 --> 00:30:31,626
It's from that book
you were all supposed to read.

508
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,714
Apparently making a commercial
for the Honda pitch would bankrupt us.

509
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,964
And it's against the rules.

510
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,553
Forget the rules for a second.

511
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,385
CGC is the same size as us.

512
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,509
So, if we can't afford to do anything,
they can't afford to.

513
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,935
So everybody's bankrupt.

514
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,471
Chaough said he's in my rearview mirror.

515
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,771
Well, guess what?

516
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,191
I'm gonna make a left turn right off a cliff.

517
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:57,448
All I have to do is let Chaough think
I'm making a commercial and he'll make one.

518
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,316
So what's our campaign?

519
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,868
We don't have a campaign.
We're not doing anything.

520
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,828
He just needs to think we are.

521
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,077
So what? He's going to make a commercial.

522
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,534
What if it's fantastic? He'll win the account.

523
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,329
You let me worry about that.

524
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:16,175
I know she's the best rep there is,
but she told me you were unavailable.

525
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:21,130
I am. Clearasil doesn't wrap until
Friday night, but maybe you could push it.

526
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,257
It sounds interesting.

527
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,473
Well, Howard, I'm going to insist
on your discretion at this point.

528
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,013
Of course.

529
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,398
It's going to be four to five days.

530
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,564
-Just a minute.
-Could you get the door?

531
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,576
I'm sorry. I thought I'd put this in here.

532
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:44,824
Later.

533
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,535
-Sorry about that.
-That's okay.

534
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,751
-You didn't see that.
-No, of course not.

535
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,919
That's Draper, isn't it?

536
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,996
Yes.

537
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,926
Anyway, it's 12 scenes.
One of them obviously has a crowd.

538
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,379
You'll need to figure out
how to shoot on the Staten Island ferry,

539
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,762
to it and from it,
and how you're going to close Fifth Avenue.

540
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:11,188
I'll be honest. I'd give anything to do this,
but right now I'm too busy.

541
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,607
Anyway, you know I'd much rather
shoot your Honda commercial.

542
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,227
I don't have one.

543
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,734
Why the hell did they call you in?
They know I've got you booked.

544
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,282
How can they afford that?

545
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,160
Get that kid in here who worked for Draper.

546
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,247
Anticipation.

547
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,454
Suspense.

548
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,501
A Honda tears through a subway tunnel,
the train nipping at its tire.

549
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,171
He keeps looking back,
the train roaring at him.

550
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,177
He's wearing a racing helmet.
And then you see him head up the steps.

551
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,515
-Can they do that?
-Howard'll make them do that.

552
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:55,228
And then he gets out on the sidewalk, stops,

553
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:58,527
kicks down the kickstand,
takes off the helmet,

554
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,276
and he is a she, California blonde.

555
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,277
Hands down, that's your best idea.

556
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,779
We'll bring a guy to the pitch
in a racing helmet,

557
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:08,199
have him take it off, it's a sexy girl.

558
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,321
What?

559
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,367
We only have $3,000,
we're not shooting shit.

560
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,788
How long did you work for Draper?

561
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,464
A little over two years.

562
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,842
When you were in a bake-off,
he ever break the rules?

563
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,344
I don't know.
He wouldn't have shared it with me,

564
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,842
but he definitely doesn't think
the rules apply to him.

565
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,595
He once disappeared for a month.

566
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,262
Does he like to play games?

567
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,100
He's always thinking
on the edges of where you are.

568
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,728
I don't know. He's a genius.

569
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,689
You ever talk that way about me?

570
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,025
You know what? Why don't you go
work for your boyfriend? Get out.

571
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,487
And give me 20 different words
for "pimples." Out!

572
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,660
Call Barbara about Howard here
and contact the city of New York.

573
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,082
We need a subway.

574
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,687
How are you doing?

575
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,769
Excuse me. Can I help you?

576
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,777
-We're late.
-No, you're not.

577
00:34:26,356 --> 00:34:28,108
Closed set. Sorry.

578
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:58,055
You scared me.

579
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,649
Who are you feeding today?

580
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,357
World travelers, Samsonite.

581
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:10,488
This is like a coconut.

582
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,653
Be careful.

583
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,040
There was a trapeze artist.

584
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:21,120
He made more in an hour here
than he makes in a week at the circus.

585
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,675
-Have you ever had this? Sake?
-No.

586
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,048
I don't know how people drink
the way you do around here.

587
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,724
I'd fall asleep.

588
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,482
So what's it like being a trapeze artist?

589
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,231
Or did you just ask him about his luggage?

590
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,654
It's good.

591
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,237
He was surprisingly modest.

592
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,985
His father does it better than him.

593
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,699
He actually said that?

594
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,531
Best part of my job.

595
00:35:57,947 --> 00:36:01,952
You'd be surprised what people
will say to an interested stranger.

596
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,379
Why does everybody need
to talk about everything?

597
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,252
I don't know but they do.

598
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,711
And no matter what happens while they're
talking, when they're done they feel better.

599
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,424
You have kids?

600
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,347
No.

601
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,728
What does your husband do?

602
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,733
I'm not married.

603
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,900
But you're wearing a... Are you divorced?

604
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:30,985
No.

605
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,151
This is just a stop sign.

606
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:40,992
I walk into a lot of offices and it's helped me
avoid a lot of distracting conversations.

607
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,910
But you told me.

608
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,501
Do you have children?

609
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,423
I do.

610
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:53,011
Two boys and a girl,
one-and-a-half, seven and 10.

611
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,424
I'm sure it must be hard to be apart.

612
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,685
I don't see them enough.

613
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:04,105
And when I do, I don't know what to do.

614
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,272
And when I drop them off I feel relieved.

615
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,983
And then I miss them.

616
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,532
I'm sorry.

617
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,367
It is not going well.

618
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:25,290
My ex-wife thinks
my daughter needs a psychiatrist.

619
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,423
And I assume you're against that.

620
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,178
I don't know.

621
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:39,345
Well, I can't say there's
any evidence to support this,

622
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:43,645
but I'm pretty sure that if you love her
and she knows it, she'll be fine.

623
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,487
Well, thank you for the drink.

624
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,404
I should be going.

625
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,328
Fake dinner plans with your fake husband?

626
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,158
Good night.

627
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,753
Now from what you told me on the phone

628
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,426
this year has been quite eventful
for your family.

629
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:21,220
I know it seems fast,
but I felt children had no concept of time

630
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,972
and Henry's really taken to them.

631
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,771
He has a daughter and she's such
an exceptional young woman.

632
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,068
If you choose to have Sally work with me,
I'd like to meet her,

633
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,487
and then interview
you and your ex-husband.

634
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,488
I doubt you'll ever meet him.
That's his level of interest.

635
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:45,078
Is this most recent incident
of the most concern for you?

636
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,826
Well, I know the divorce is mostly to blame,

637
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:52,039
but she's been different
ever since my father died.

638
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,208
He lived with us briefly.

639
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,299
They were very close.

640
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,972
I wish he had met Henry.
That's my husband.

641
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,609
They would've gotten along.

642
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,025
My mother... I don't know.

643
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:20,401
My goodness, if I had done what Sally did,
my mother was very strict about it.

644
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:27,791
My brother, he saved his money and bought
a nudist magazine and showed it to me.

645
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:32,917
And then, my mother found it
and she nailed it to his bedroom door.

646
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,169
What about you?

647
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,136
I was private and mostly outgrew it.

648
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,179
I see.

649
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,601
-Dr. Keener...
-Call me Dr. Edna. That's what the kids do.

650
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:57,483
Of course I know children do this.
But not in public.

651
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,950
I feel like Sally did this to punish me
somehow, for everything.

652
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,037
That must be a terrible feeling.

653
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,289
It is.

654
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,249
You have to believe me.
I had to get divorced.

655
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,841
I felt it best for them
to have some stability in their life

656
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,641
and in the end,
she doesn't understand that it'll be better.

657
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,562
Sounds to me like it wouldn't be bad
for you to talk to someone.

658
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,765
No. No, I'm okay.

659
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:40,234
Well, I think it'd be helpful if you and I
were to meet once a month

660
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,941
just to keep up with Sally's progress.

661
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,695
Will you tell me
what she talks about in here?

662
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,950
No.

663
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,993
And the other way around as well.

664
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,079
That's better.

665
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,500
So I think we should start
at four days a week.

666
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,673
Let me go get my date book.

667
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,576
-Where's your film?
-What film?

668
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,078
That's how you're shaking it?
I heard it stunk.

669
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,289
We didn't make one. it's too expensive.

670
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,541
Well, then you're out of luck, Donny.

671
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,297
'Cause I sure wouldn't
want to follow what I showed them

672
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,000
with a speech and a couple of posters.

673
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,608
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.

674
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,228
Donald Draper.

675
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,907
Where is Mr. Cooper and Mr. Campbell?

676
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,492
And Sterling?

677
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,569
They couldn't make it.

678
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,246
You created this set of rules
to even the playing field.

679
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,246
It says specifically, "No finished work."

680
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,837
I understand not everybody
has observed this.

681
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,845
I don't really want to be a part
of a competition like that

682
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,217
so I'm withdrawing us.

683
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,242
Thank you for thinking of us.

684
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,323
Good afternoon.

685
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,842
The voiceover announcer for Lucky
has a severe case of chest congestion.

686
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,669
Get the boy wonder on it.

687
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,961
Greg, accounts?

688
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,046
No, Pete.

689
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,429
Have a drink. it'll make me look younger.

690
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,269
I'm not gonna watch you
feel sorry for yourself.

691
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,892
I feel sorry for all of us.

692
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,307
Don's over there surrendering right now.

693
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,146
Would you stop?

694
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:29,658
There was a kid on the destroyer,
PFC Brycen,

695
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,735
and he was an honest-to-goodness poet.

696
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,913
-And then during...
-Roger, I don't want to hear it.

697
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,333
My husband's gonna be in uniform
any day now.

698
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,328
But how do you think he's gonna feel

699
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:45,419
when one day some Pete Campbell
goes to some Vietnamese doctor?

700
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,594
Since when is forgiveness
a better quality than loyalty?

701
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,303
Roger, I know it was awful,

702
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,974
and I know it'll never seem
like it was that long ago,

703
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:02,899
but you fought to make the world
a safer place and you won and now it is.

704
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:05,985
You think so?

705
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,277
Really?

706
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,238
I have to.

707
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,571
-Anything else?
-No.

708
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,704
Good afternoon.
Your daughter's psychiatrist called.

709
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,874
Lower your voice, please.

710
00:44:41,888 --> 00:44:43,140
Congratulations.

711
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,190
I just spoke with Mr. Saito.

712
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,273
It seems Honda was never
going to leave Grey,

713
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,731
but of the three princes
invited to meet the princess,

714
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,908
you were the most charming.

715
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,951
We're first in the door on their little car.

716
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,153
And CGC?

717
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,114
Out of the running.

718
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,699
We killed him.

719
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,670
That stunt you pulled was unseemly.

720
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:08,543
The only reason I let you continue was...

721
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,624
Let me?

722
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,091
Do you think Joan can rent stage space
without talking to me?

723
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:19,760
I let you because I realized
that our financial future

724
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,220
was related to Mr. Chaough's demise.

725
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:23,846
So what is it?

726
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,686
Are you thanking me or reprimanding me?

727
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:30,942
-Let's not pretend like this wasn't a big risk.
-We're thanking you.

728
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,032
Send over what you have on the car.

729
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:40,785
It redlines at 9,500 RPM,
but it only has 57 horsepower.

730
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,031
What?

731
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,209
It's a motorcycle with doors.

732
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,501
The nice thing is it has windows,

733
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,549
so you can see your brains spatter against it
when it crashes.

734
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,960
They're working on it.

735
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,260
Cheers.

736
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,354
Hello, Sally.

737
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,070
I'm Dr. Edna.

738
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,027
Why don't you come inside?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
