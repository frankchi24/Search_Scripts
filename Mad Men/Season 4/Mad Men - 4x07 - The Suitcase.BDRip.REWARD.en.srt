1
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,676
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

2
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,594
-Two for the Campbells,
-Where are these exactly?

3
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,672
It's a movie theater, no bad seats.

4
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,885
The Cosgroves,
and Joey, Stan, Danny, $10 each.

5
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,847
How come we have to pay when everyone
knows damn well they were free?

6
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,930
You're such a Jew.

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,517
Your friends in Hollywood know
you talk that way?

8
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,068
And let me tell you, you're the Jew,

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,363
trying to make 30 bucks
on something you got for free.

10
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,281
Twenty-five on Clay by a knockout.

11
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,110
Liston is favored for a reason.
Cassius Clay is scared.

12
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,702
Of what, pray tell?

13
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,951
He had an elevated heart rate
before the last fight.

14
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,284
Who says that means you're scared?
It happens to me all the time,

15
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,368
it runs in my family.

16
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,753
Liston has the weight
and he's never been knocked out.

17
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:19,830
Sonny's old.

18
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,461
He's experienced.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,292
Don, I've got your ticket.

20
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,216
You want to put something down?
Stan's got a barber who makes book.

21
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,463
Yeah, who do you like?

22
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,891
I was just saying
I think Clay'd make one hell of an adman.

23
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,807
You're right. Give me 100 on Liston.

24
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,224
Joining us for a little
pre-fight steak and cocktails at The Palm?

25
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,856
Absolutely. Samsonite team, in my office.

26
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,657
Listen, if it comes up with Jennifer,
I did pay for the seats.

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,574
Can you make a dinner reservation
before the bout for Mr. Sterling and me

28
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,654
anywhere but The Palm?

29
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,990
I don't know why
everyone cares so much about it.

30
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:59,374
If I wanted to see two Negroes fight,
I'd throw a dollar bill out my window.

31
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,002
I thought we were doing this at 9:00.
it's 11:15.

32
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:05,926
I'm late, but you're not. Good work so far.
Where do you want me?

33
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,920
Behind the desk is fine.

34
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,266
You're in a white studio, like in some limbo.

35
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,571
There's two no-name football players
holding an American Tourister and a Skyway

36
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,570
going against Mr. Joe Namath

37
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,904
and his defender,
a sexy girl holding a Samsonite,

38
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,112
and maybe a referee.

39
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,200
So, we hear, "Hut, hut, hike!"
Namath fades back.

40
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,576
"Oh, no, it's a blitz!"

41
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,415
Punch in on Namath,
he says something like...

42
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,626
"The secret to victory on the road
is Samsonite.

43
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,301
"I carry it because it's tough,

44
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,096
"and no matter what comes at me,
I know I'm protected."

45
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,973
As they fall, the competitors will bust open,
clothing flying out.

46
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,554
Touchdown, Samsonite!

47
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,685
-I got it, honey.
-You sure do, Joe.

48
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,060
â€œSamsonite It's tough

49
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,068
Endorsements are lazy,

50
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,946
and I don't like Joe Namath.

51
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,618
He hasn't even played
in a professional game yet.

52
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,366
He's very handsome.

53
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,198
And women don't buy suitcases.

54
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,824
Dr. Faye says they do.

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,702
Could you leave us, please?

56
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:36,100
Peggy, I'm glad that this is an environment
where you feel free to fail.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,268
You wanted to go with Danny's idea.

58
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,849
Because it works.

59
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,228
"Only Samsonite is tough."
It's the execution that's the problem.

60
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,438
Okay, should it be funny?

61
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:49,071
Actually funny? Maybe.
Funny like what I just saw? No.

62
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,083
Hello.

63
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,635
You remembered my birthday.

64
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,429
Did you open my present?

65
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,677
I am. Hold on.

66
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,433
My goodness.

67
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,737
I'm finally doing
what I should've done years ago.

68
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,406
Phillips-Olson something probably,
but I'll need you.

69
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,235
I want to form an agency
that specializes in women's products

70
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,116
with you as my creative director.

71
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,992
I don't know what to say.

72
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,291
But you're smiling, right?

73
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,083
I have some very...

74
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,285
It's sort of a little under the table,

75
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,247
but very high-level talks
with the people at Tampax.

76
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,587
Peggy, it's Tampax, 50% market share.
I mean they're really up there.

77
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,966
Plus that queer at Belle Jolie
has been barking up my tree.

78
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,844
Plus I have my European connections.

79
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,432
It sounds exciting.

80
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,348
The train's leaving the station, honey.
Get on board.

81
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,645
Where am I calling you?

82
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,151
I'm in my office at home.

83
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,316
So, you already told Grey?

84
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,319
I'm not wasting my talents
over there anymore.

85
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,025
Believe me, it was mutual.

86
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,740
Duck, did you lose your job?

87
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,869
Peggy, this is good.

88
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,248
I'm not gonna lie.
I was a little inspired by what Draper did.

89
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,919
Now I just need some accounts.

90
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,463
It's tough because, well...
It's tough to get a credit line.

91
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,132
So, what do you have so far?

92
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,423
I know it's not a diamond necklace,
but I did spend some money on those cards.

93
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:45,221
And I appreciate the gesture. It's just...

94
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:49,854
I don't know whether to take this seriously
because I suspect you've been drinking.

95
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,894
Well, you're wrong.

96
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,732
I heard about the CLIOs.

97
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,568
I have to see you tonight.

98
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,573
I have plans.

99
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,867
What, with that Mark? He's another one.

100
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:04,081
Duck, you are a valuable account man.
You have a bright future.

101
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,374
You just need to
go to one of those headhunters and...

102
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,575
I need to see you, babe.

103
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,665
Don't do that.

104
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,500
Peg, I'm falling apart.

105
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,132
Don't you know you're the last thing
that made me feel good about myself?

106
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,636
Pull your hands out of your panties.

107
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,844
I can't talk right now.

108
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,062
I want to see you tonight.

109
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,771
You been farting in here?

110
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,270
I have to go.

111
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,620
We're going to lunch.

112
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,661
I don't know if you could tell,
but he hated it.

113
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,831
I was hating it too while we were doing it,
but not before. I'm not gonna lie.

114
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,507
So, we're back to the drawing board.
Still gotta eat.

115
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,960
Come on, it's your birthday.
We'll let you talk through lunch.

116
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,096
You got a call while you were in the toilet
to the direct line.

117
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,179
Stephanie from California, no last name.
She says it's urgent.

118
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,685
Would you like me to place the call?

119
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,980
No, I've got it.

120
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,890
Bad news. Our night is ruined.

121
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,100
I took care of that.
The kids are going to The Palm.

122
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,526
We are going anywhere else.

123
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,070
Well, the brotherhood
of Alcoholics Anonymous,

124
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,695
Freddy and Cal Rutledge from Pond's
will be joining us for dinner and the fight,

125
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,241
which means we'll have to drink before
dinner, if we want to drink at all.

126
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,946
And then there's all the talk about drinking,

127
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,909
where they start with the funny stories
and they end up crying.

128
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,993
Again.

129
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,417
Fifteen months
I've been waiting for this fight.

130
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,217
$300.
Liston has to lose by unconsciousness.

131
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,470
-Get rid of 'em.
-I can't.

132
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,222
I should work on Samsonite.

133
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,936
That's in two weeks. I'm gonna be in Florida.
Now, this is your job too. Let's go.

134
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,982
I'm sorry. You can do that without me.
Samsonite you can't.

135
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,192
Are you serious?
We can solve this problem with a flask.

136
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,983
No, I wouldn't be good company anyway.

137
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,571
That's never bothered me before.

138
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,109
I don't know what it is,
but I look at the side of your neck

139
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,532
and I wish I had
one of those James Bond pens

140
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,075
so I could jam a dart in it.

141
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,488
James Bond likes to travel.
He goes all over the world.

142
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,996
He goes underwater.
He met a girl underwater.

143
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,247
I think this is a good place to stop.

144
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,169
See you tomorrow.

145
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,920
Great.

146
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,802
I don't like sitting at my desk
and looking into a garbage dump.

147
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,722
Although I am paid less,
I am still not a janitor.

148
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:02,773
Thank you, gentlemen.

149
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,692
-Doing something special for your birthday?
-Mark is taking me to dinner.

150
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,822
The Forum of the Twelve Caesars.

151
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,575
Yes.

152
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,115
How old are you?

153
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,999
Twenty-six, today.

154
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,211
You're doing all right, aren't you?

155
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,677
Well, hello. Did I hear it's your birthday?

156
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,637
It is.

157
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,847
How are you feeling?

158
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,299
Well,

159
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,557
of course my days are spent sleeping
and visiting the ladies' room,

160
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,357
although it's an incredible feeling
having this baby kick me.

161
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,064
Is it any different than living with Pete?

162
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,947
You're witty.

163
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,319
I always assumed that,
but it turns out it's true.

164
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,743
Are you going to watch the tight?

165
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,787
Yes. I've been watching boxing
since I was a little girl.

166
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,664
My father loves blood sport.

167
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,213
Mr. Draper's looking for you.

168
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,212
I'm sorry. I have to go.

169
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,420
Happy birthday.

170
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,799
You know, 26 is still very young.

171
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,269
Have fun.

172
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,105
I want a rare steak, and I want to see
those two men pound each other.

173
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,406
Cynthia's at the restaurant. We should go.

174
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,482
What about Jennifer?

175
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,319
Don't go in there. Don't do it.

176
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,580
-She's dead.
-Let's beat it before it's us.

177
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,171
-I was just on my way out.
-Did you get California?

178
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:49,251
Do you want me to try before I depart?
There's a time difference, you know.

179
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,840
I do, but it goes the other way.

180
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,593
Good night, Mr. Draper.

181
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,182
Get in here.

182
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,019
Why don't you talk to Joan
and get rid of her?

183
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,770
No, Joan knew exactly what I needed
and made sure that I got it.

184
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,859
So, where are we on Samsonite?

185
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,815
We'll have something to show you
in the morning.

186
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,943
But the suspense is killing me.

187
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,734
Well, I kind of was on my way out.

188
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,785
Let me just see where we are.

189
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,576
I guess I've got a minute.

190
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,305
Okay.

191
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,434
We thought that Samsonite
is this very rare element,

192
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,145
this mythical substance,
the hardest on earth,

193
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,356
and we see an adventurer
leaping through a cave.

194
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,658
Is this a substance much like bullshit?

195
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:59,696
I thought we could drop one off
the Eiffel Tower, with a countdown,

196
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,157
like the moon shot
and show how it doesn't break.

197
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,376
-But it would, wouldn't it?
-Probably.

198
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,544
The government has prohibited us
from doing things like that, Peggy.

199
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,670
They feel that it is not in the public interest.

200
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:18,306
We have a thing with Samson,
because he's strong and his hair.

201
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,930
I gave you more responsibility
and you didn't do anything?

202
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,013
That you like. We did work. A lot.

203
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,270
I don't care if you work 10 seconds
if you bring me something I like.

204
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,067
We're going to do this right now.

205
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,440
I Know you have plans.

206
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,617
You were going to call me
from a bar with an idea?

207
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,365
You think elves do this?

208
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,863
You're just gonna change it anyway.

209
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,448
Excuse me?

210
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,046
This is Mark Kerney.

211
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,722
I am so sorry.

212
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,925
I got drawn into his web.
It's gonna be a while.

213
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,053
A while like soon,
or a while like I should cancel?

214
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,890
Fifteen minutes? It shouldn't take too long.
He's going to the boxing match.

215
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,141
He's going to Maine?

216
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:13,319
You can watch it on closed-circuit TV
in the movie theaters. We got tickets.

217
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:14,896
How come we didn't go?

218
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,863
Because we're having
a romantic dinner for my birthday.

219
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,780
Well, did you tell him that?

220
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,075
Look, I'm the only one
who can help him with this,

221
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,869
and the sooner I get off the phone,
the sooner I can come.

222
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,708
Just hurry, will you?

223
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,670
She's gonna be a few minutes late.

224
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,793
A surprise on top of a surprise.

225
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,132
She works too hard-

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,049
"The Oysters of Hercules,
which you with sword shall carve."

227
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,972
I saw a tray pass by.
They look like hockey pucks.

228
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,265
$1.65. You should let Gerry get this.

229
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,972
Mom, don't cut the kid off at the knees.

230
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:58,023
Now, what if an elephant either sits on
or steps on a suitcase?

231
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,655
How about
a slow-moving airplane runs it over?

232
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,532
Do you like Cassius Clay?

233
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,201
He's very handsome.

234
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,828
I don't think so.

235
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,708
You're not supposed to.

236
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,166
I remember
my mother talking about Nat King Cole

237
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,627
in a way that made my father
throw out all his records.

238
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:26,393
He's got a big mouth.
"I'm the greatest." Not if you have to say it.

239
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,850
Muhammad Ali.

240
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,478
Do you like the airplane?

241
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:37,438
Liston just goes about his business,
works methodically.

242
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,989
Clay will dance and talk,
throw a few until he's wiped out.

243
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,663
A bag under an airplane
looks like there's been an accident.

244
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,585
Three classes of suitcase.

245
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,712
Featherweight, middleweight, heavyweight.
For whatever class you're in.

246
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,170
But how do you do that on TV?
What's the story?

247
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,713
You don't like it?

248
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,680
No, I love it. That's great.
That's what we should do.

249
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,604
Let it ring.

250
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,399
I'll say you're not here.

251
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,449
Hello? Hello, Roger. No, he's not here.

252
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,740
I answer other people's phones all the time.

253
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,283
I'm going to count to three,

254
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,660
then I'm gonna start saying
a lot of words you don't like, sweetheart.

255
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,825
This should be good.

256
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,995
I'm begging you, get down here right away.

257
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,748
You think I'd rather be working?

258
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,172
Yeah, I do.

259
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,376
Did you know
Freddy Rumsen collects Indian arrowheads?

260
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,337
Where are you?

261
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,098
There's a bar next to Keenes.
I've been sneaking off to fortify myself.

262
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,221
Tell 'em you're sick. Go home.

263
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,478
I am sick. I think I overdid it.

264
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:57,025
And they're self so righteous.
I never pissed my pants.

265
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,148
This guy Rutledge
killed a man with a motorboat.

266
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,526
You know what gets you over
something like that? Drinking.

267
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,733
Still got your ticket.

268
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,902
It's an attractive offer.

269
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,530
Look out your window. Can you see me?

270
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,250
Good night, sweetheart.

271
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,964
Go ahead. I'll wait.

272
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,755
Hello.

273
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,383
Fifteen minutes? It's almost an hour.

274
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,180
I'm so sorry. I'm gonna leave any minute.
Did you at least have something?

275
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,808
You have to get down here.
You have to get down here right away.

276
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,441
I can't just leave, okay?

277
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,655
But you have to, okay?

278
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,949
You know what?
Just go to my apartment and wait for me.

279
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,276
We can eat there another time.

280
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,528
No, I don't want to do that.

281
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,784
I'll make it worth your while.

282
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,039
Damn it, Peggy.

283
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,709
I've got your whole family here
for a surprise dinner, okay?

284
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,287
And the only way you can make it worse
is by not coming at all.

285
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,459
Mark.

286
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,884
I'm so sorry. I'm coming right now.

287
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,587
Thank you.

288
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,801
Well, so much for the surprise.

289
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,267
Okay, I'm going to leave
if that's all right with you.

290
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,024
I'm not so sure about it.

291
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,777
I mean every time we get into this,
we abandon the toughness idea.

292
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,403
Maybe there's something to the elephant.

293
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,867
Do you want one?

294
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,668
I'm sorry. Do you have someplace to be?

295
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,460
Maybe tap your foot so I get the message.

296
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,426
I was supposed to be at dinner an hour ago.
it's my birthday.

297
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,878
And I'm pretty sure I ruined everything.

298
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,504
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

299
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,719
I don't know.
Because I thought this would take a second.

300
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,596
So, now I'm supposed to feel like crap?

301
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:59,522
"I'm so sick that I ruined her birthday."
Do you know when my birthday is?

302
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,186
I was your secretary.

303
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,772
Well, enjoy your evening!

304
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,947
By the way, you are 20-something years old.
it's time to get over birthdays.

305
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,989
Go ahead. I'll do it myself.

306
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,177
Yes, I'm that important.

307
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,768
So, the fact that you're calling means
you haven't left yet.

308
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,388
I'm not gonna be able to make it at all.

309
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:41,806
Are you kidding me?

310
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,725
I'm sorry, but no one asked you to do this.

311
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,988
You said you never had a surprise.
I can't believe you.

312
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,490
This is your mother speaking.

313
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,401
Hello, Ma.

314
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:58,080
I just want you to know that we're all here.
Me, Anita, Gerry, the roommate,

315
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,748
and we're not leaving
until you march in here.

316
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,206
I can't, okay?
Could you put Mark on the phone?

317
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,170
He's crestfallen, you know?

318
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:08,841
-Mrs. Olson, it's okay.
-It's not okay.

319
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,793
Now he's making excuses for you.

320
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,847
I don't know how many nice boys
you think are lining up for you.

321
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,550
You should be grateful. Okay, goodbye.

322
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,886
Hello?

323
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,263
I'm sorry I ruined this,

324
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,440
and I'm sorry you had to
spend the evening with my mother.

325
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,767
You know what? She's right.

326
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,279
Really? Then why don't you date her?
She's never even had a job.

327
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,531
How the hell are you mad at me?

328
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,317
Because you used my birthday

329
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,744
to get in good
with a bunch of people who drive me crazy.

330
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,113
Should I have invited Don?
You never stand him up.

331
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,616
What's the point of doing
anything nice for you?

332
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,710
Jesus. You even sound like my mother.

333
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,045
I'm already into this place for $40.

334
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,249
If you don't mind,
I'm going to enjoy my dinner,

335
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,958
and you enjoy your work.

336
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,006
The fact that you would stay there...

337
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,129
You know what?

338
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,840
Forget it.

339
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,508
No. What?

340
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,264
You want to do this right now?

341
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,595
Do what?

342
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,148
Fine. it's been nice knowing you.
Happy birthday.

343
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,642
So, that's it?

344
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,445
Yup. Good night.

345
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,696
Hello?

346
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,576
It'll be fine. Couples fight. Ask Gerry.

347
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,182
What's wrong? Elevator out?

348
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,894
I think I just broke up with Mark.

349
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:47,061
Really?

350
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,058
I think so.

351
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,143
So, go home.

352
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,777
Nope. I'm ready to work. You win. Again.

353
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,952
You could've just told me
it was your birthday.

354
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,325
Right, and there'd be no repercussions.

355
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,830
So, now this is my fault?

356
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,950
Well, it's not my fault
you don't have a family, or friends,

357
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,034
or anywhere else to go.

358
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:12,340
Go. Go. Run to him like in the movies.
You don't have to be here.

359
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,004
I do have to be here

360
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,962
because of some stupid idea from Danny
who you had to hire

361
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,718
because you stole his other stupid idea
because you were drunk.

362
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,888
Don't get personal
because you didn't do your work.

363
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,222
And by the way, I know it kills you,
but guess what?

364
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,022
There is no Danny's idea.

365
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,271
Everything that comes in here
belongs to the agency.

366
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,397
You mean you.

367
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,444
As long as you still work here.

368
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,147
Is that a threat?

369
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,232
Because I've already taken somebody up
on one of those tonight.

370
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,075
Relax.

371
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,370
You know what?
Here's a blank piece of paper.

372
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,912
Why don't you turn that into Glo-Coat?

373
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,161
Are you out of your mind?

374
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,959
You gave me 20 ideas
and I picked out one of them

375
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,128
that was a kernel
that became that commercial.

376
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,204
So, you remember.

377
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,923
I do. It was something about a cowboy.
Congratulations.

378
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,297
No, it was something about a kid
locked in a closet

379
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,845
because his mother
was making him wait for the floor to dry,

380
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,297
which is basically the whole commercial.

381
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,381
It's a kernel.

382
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,676
Which you changed just enough
so that it was yours.

383
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,510
I changed it into a commercial.

384
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,438
What, are we going to
shoot him in the dark in the closet?

385
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,357
That's the way it works.
There are no credits on commercials.

386
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,684
But you got the CLIO!

387
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,690
It's your job!

388
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,771
I give you money, you give me ideas.

389
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,240
And you never say thank you.

390
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,659
That's what the money is for!

391
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,411
You're young. You will get your recognition.

392
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,614
And honestly, it is absolutely ridiculous

393
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,792
to be two years into your career
and counting your ideas.

394
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,289
Everything to you is an opportunity.

395
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,590
And you should be thanking me
every morning when you wake up,

396
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,635
along with Jesus,
for giving you another day!

397
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,302
Come on.

398
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,888
I'm sorry about your boyfriend, okay?

399
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,335
May 25th. Ideas for Samsonite.

400
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,005
Toughness means that...

401
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,406
Peggy, get in here.

402
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,583
-No.
-Come on.

403
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,376
You have to come in here right now.

404
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,746
What do you want?

405
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,086
You have to hear this. Sit down.

406
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,256
Come on. Sit.

407
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,518
So, this is tape number 4 of Sterling's Gold

408
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,597
by Roger Sterling.

409
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,234
So, where was I?

410
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,776
Bert Cooper hated me
and I thought it was because

411
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,577
he thought I 'd be an ally of my father;

412
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:32,873
but it turned out it was something
to do with my joie de vivre,

413
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,667
my romantic prowess.

414
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:37,245
See tape 3.

415
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,507
Including some time
with the queen of perversions,

416
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,425
his secretary Ida Blankenship.

417
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,259
You know what? Don't use her name.

418
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:53,436
But it was all about him
hating my very youth,

419
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,356
all because the poor guy had been out down
in the height of his sexual prime

420
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,729
by an unnecessary orchiectomy.

421
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,813
Lyle Evans, M. D. I think he had him killed.

422
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:10,366
Anyway, sometime in the summer of '48...
No, 1932.

423
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,788
NO, 1939.

424
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,829
Why are you laughing?
It's like reading someone's diary.

425
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:24,754
Come on. Ida was a hellcat?
Cooper lost his balls?

426
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,959
Roger's writing a book?

427
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,434
-I should go.
-Stay and visit.

428
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,311
I've got nothing to say.

429
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,975
Sure you do.

430
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,689
No, it's personal.

431
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,979
We have personal conversations.

432
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:46,364
No, we don't, and I think you like it that way.
I know I do.

433
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,025
Suit yourself.

434
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:54,405
We're supposed to be staring at each other
over candlelight,

435
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,956
and he invites my mother?

436
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,374
He doesn't know me. it's not my fault.

437
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:09,841
I guess I'm back to square one. Single.

438
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,010
Well, as Danny would say,
"There's no use crying over fish in the sea."

439
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,306
Mouse!

440
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,350
Over there!

441
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,064
What are you doing?

442
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,365
Get the suitcase.

443
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,483
Why?

444
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,696
I'm gonna seal it up in my nice Samsonite
and throw it off the roof.

445
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:35,988
Don't.

446
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,366
Come on.
Every idea you have is some version of that.

447
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,327
Let's do it. Where'd you go, Mickey?

448
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,461
I think it's a rat.

449
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,624
It's a mouse. I grew up on a farm.

450
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,134
You know what?

451
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,341
There's a way out of this room
we don't know about.

452
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:01,972
Are you okay?

453
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,313
I think that's yours.

454
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,562
It's probably Mark. I don't want to answer it.

455
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,858
It's still your birthday.
Let me get you dinner.

456
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,874
What's the most exciting thing
about a suitcase?

457
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,041
Going somewhere.

458
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,581
The Acropolis.

459
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:32,757
I'd like to go to Greece.
I hear all the good cooks stayed there.

460
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,764
I'd like to just go on a plane. I've never been.

461
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,886
Is that right?

462
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:41,603
I've heard about it, obviously.
I've seen it in the movies.

463
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,271
It's an incredible idea, flying.

464
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,270
I remember on the way to Korea

465
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,695
they told us
how many thousand feet in the air we were.

466
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,401
There was some other kid there,
more of a yokel than me, even.

467
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,612
And he screamed, "Man wasn't meant to fly!"

468
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,376
Cooper has no testicles?

469
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,087
I don't want water.

470
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:18,015
My Uncle Max said he had a suitcase
that was always packed.

471
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,809
He said, "A man has to be ready to go
at any moment."

472
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,055
Jesus. Maybe it's a metaphor.

473
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:29,025
There's something to that idea.

474
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:30,819
I don't know.

475
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,238
I can't tell the difference anymore
between something that's good

476
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,986
and something that's awful.

477
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,160
Well, they're very close.

478
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:44,829
But the best idea always wins
and you know it when you see it.

479
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,500
Keep banging your head against the wall,
then it happens.

480
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,838
And then it's done.

481
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:52,712
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,545
Not like everything else in my life.

483
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:04,053
I mean, I know what I'm supposed to want,
but it just never feels right.

484
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,434
Or as important as anything in that office.

485
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,276
-I didn't know you were in Korea.
-Very briefly.

486
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,152
-Did you shoot anybody?
-Nope.

487
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,577
I saw some people get killed.
That's memorable.

488
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:25,616
My father died right in front of me.
Heart attack. I was 12.

489
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,371
Sorry to hear that.

490
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:33,841
It was pretty violent. The TV was on.
That's why I hate sports.

491
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,670
Nobody was around... Saturday afternoon.
My mother was shopping.

492
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:42,216
I saw my father die too.
He was kicked by a horse.

493
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,927
You're kidding.

494
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,057
What about your mother?

495
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,438
I never knew her.

496
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,736
Why is there a dog in the Parthenon?

497
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,239
That is a roach. Let's go someplace darker.

498
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:17,506
I hate dating. I'm terrible at it.

499
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:21,885
You'll find someone.
You know you're cute as hell.

500
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:28,062
Men don't exactly stop and stare
in the streets.

501
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,515
-Do you want that?
-That's not what you were supposed to say.

502
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,767
What do you care what I think?

503
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:42,569
Everybody thinks I slept with you
to get the job.

504
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,494
They joke about it,

505
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,619
like it's so funny
because the possibility was so remote.

506
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,087
It's not because you aren't attractive.

507
00:31:54,162 --> 00:32:00,465
I have to keep rules about work. I have to.

508
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,137
You're an attractive girl, Peggy.

509
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,176
Not as attractive
as some of your other secretaries, I guess.

510
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,777
You don't want to start
giving me morality lessons, do you?

511
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,814
People do things, right?

512
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,322
My mother thinks you were responsible

513
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:32,535
because you were the only person
who visited me in the hospital.

514
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,583
-Jesus. Really?
-She hates you.

515
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,335
Do you know who it was?

516
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,761
Of course I do.

517
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,259
Do you ever think about it?

518
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,933
I try not to.

519
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,184
But then it comes up out of nowhere.

520
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,981
Playgrounds.

521
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:08,408
Here's Cassius Clay
starting to put up a fight.-.

522
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,830
Get up!

523
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:11,991
Get up!

524
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,542
Come on! Get up!

525
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,371
Get up!

526
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,331
-Come on, get up!
-Get up.

527
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,963
Get up! Get up!

528
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,636
...to the top of the head.
Now, here comes Jersey Joe Walcott,

529
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:28,090
and he says it's all over!

530
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,721
It's a fix. The fix is in.

531
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,099
-What happened?
-it's over.

532
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,479
-Already? Who won?
-Clay.

533
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:41,357
Don't believe that for a second.
No one goes down like that.

534
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,063
That's what the man just said.

535
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,661
Some fight. I lost 100 bucks in two minutes.

536
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,034
Let's go back, pack up and go home.

537
00:33:56,576 --> 00:34:00,752
Damn elevator's like a rocket.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

538
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:14,928
Are you okay?

539
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,952
Do you want any water?

540
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,619
What?

541
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,290
I have toothpaste
and a toothbrush in my desk.

542
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:40,370
Peggy!

543
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:43,957
Peggy?

544
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,508
-Peggy?
-I'll be right back.

545
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,092
Peggy?

546
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,808
Duck?

547
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,646
What are you doing?

548
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,904
-Leaving Draper a little present.
-Duck, that's disgusting!

549
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,027
Would you let me concentrate?

550
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,824
This is Roger's office.

551
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,540
Now, come one. Pull up your pants.

552
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,842
I'm not going anywhere without you.

553
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,425
Baby. Baby, I need you so bad.

554
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,301
You wouldn't answer your phone,

555
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,182
and your roommate said
you were still at work.

556
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,269
Why didn't you answer the phone, Peewee?

557
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,229
What's going on?

558
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:50,440
Just go lay down.

559
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,151
You don't belong here.

560
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,162
So, Peggy, I see you're not alone.

561
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,159
I guess when screwing me
couldn't get you anything,

562
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,743
you had to go back to Draper.

563
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,203
-Duck, let's go.
-No.

564
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,545
That's right. We were in love.

565
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,007
Turns out she's just another whore.

566
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:13,755
Hey!

567
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,806
Jesus! Would you stop!

568
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,523
Stop it! You're both drunk!

569
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:30,485
You know, I killed 17 men at Okinawa.

570
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,947
Uncle.

571
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,327
What the hell is wrong with you?

572
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,783
You still think you're better than me?

573
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,130
Come on, Peggy. Let's go.

574
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,284
I got rid of him. Are you okay?

575
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,796
Yeah.

576
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:30,957
Are you?

577
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:37,222
I... I never thought...

578
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,846
I'm so sorry. I...

579
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,973
You know what?
I don't know why I was with him.

580
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,178
It was a confusing time.

581
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,433
Stop.

582
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,062
You don't have to explain.

583
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,527
Can you get me a drink?

584
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,323
How long are you gonna go on like this?

585
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,416
I have to make a phone call
and I know it's going to be bad, okay?

586
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,664
Do you want to be alone?

587
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,841
Just make me a drink.

588
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,041
Sorry if I embarrassed you.

589
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:42,649
Hello.

590
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,655
It's me.

591
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,990
She's gone.

592
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,865
I know.

593
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,584
She wanted you to know.

594
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,297
I'm sorry I didn't call. I was...

595
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,219
Did she want to talk to me?

596
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,758
You know, she wasn't really there.

597
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:17,692
I'm coming out. I'll make the arrangements.

598
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,690
No need. She left her body to science.

599
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:27,118
She said she wanted to go to
UCLA Medical School tuition-free.

600
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:29,362
Of course she did.

601
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,453
I'm coming out. I'll take care of the house.

602
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,924
I'd like to stay here if that's okay with you,
take some time off from school.

603
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,255
Of course. That's fine.

604
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,807
She's in a better place.

605
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,558
That's what they say.

606
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,022
It's late and it's been a long day.

607
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,239
Okay. Goodbye.

608
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,320
Goodbye.

609
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,119
Stephanie.

610
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,577
What happened?

611
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,960
Somebody very important to me died.

612
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,124
Who?

613
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:09,095
The only person in the world
who really knew me.

614
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,060
That's not true.

615
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,820
You should go home.

616
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:34,571
You can come in late. I'll be fine.

617
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,453
I'm so sorry.

618
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:44,914
Good night.

619
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,210
Drop and give me 20!

620
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,795
You asshole!

621
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,715
Get to work. it's 10:30, maggot.

622
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:35,719
Did you spend the night here?

623
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,633
Yeah.

624
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:38,926
See the tight?

625
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,303
No.

626
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,980
Ninety seconds of boxing
and three hours of analysis.

627
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,056
And we still don't know who won.

628
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,063
Clay won. Read the paper.

629
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:54,734
Come in.

630
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,914
You look fresh. Did you go home?

631
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:04,077
I spruced up. Come over here.

632
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,631
Look at this.

633
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,015
I think you have to know the photo.

634
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,262
It's on the front page of every paper.
It's historic.

635
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,854
How do we know
it's the Tourister that got knocked out?

636
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,058
Because the slogan will say so.

637
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,018
How do you put it on TV?
Are they animated?

638
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,941
Why are you shitting on this?

639
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,106
I'm tired.

640
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,870
It's good. it's very good.

641
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,389
Give it to Joey. No, Stan.

642
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:06,143
Then go home, shower,
and come back and give me 10 tag lines.

643
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,314
Okay.

644
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,070
Open or closed?

645
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,073
Open.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
