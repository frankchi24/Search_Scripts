1
00:00:00,532 --> 00:00:01,962
I want to stop doing this.

2
00:00:02,342 --> 00:00:04,007
<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

3
00:00:04,367 --> 00:00:07,546
It's been my privilege
to be treated like a prodigy,

4
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:09,297
and for you to be my mentor.

5
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,217
We're going to
lose Jaguar unless

6
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:12,843
an arrangement is made...

7
00:00:12,905 --> 00:00:14,437
Tell them I want a partnership.

8
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,681
My wife's a big TV star.

9
00:00:17,924 --> 00:00:18,919
Break a leg.

10
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,722
<i>Beans came in today.</i>

11
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:22,670
And he says he's gonna
kill the account and himself

12
00:00:22,776 --> 00:00:24,600
if they even talk
to ketchup again.

13
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,522
I want you to find out
everything you can on Heinz ketchup.

14
00:00:55,915 --> 00:00:58,876

15
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,479
So you haven't
officially told anyone

16
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,147
you're looking to change
your life?

17
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:14,115
Yes.

18
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:16,251
Why put Doyle Dane
into hysterics

19
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,887
when all I want to do
is have what NASA calls

20
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:21,656
an "exploratory mission"
with your agency?

21
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:25,926
Still, Timmy, Don has
some anxiety about--

22
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,496
well, obviously about Raymond.

23
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:31,632
Heinz Baked Beans has given us

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,335
national recognition
and Raymond's a friend.

25
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:37,003
I'm not used to telling people
what my account is worth.

26
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,438
Not just in billings,

27
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:40,540
but in the prestige
that comes with ketchup.

28
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,342
Don knows that
or he wouldn't be here.

29
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,476
He's not that polite.

30
00:01:44,912 --> 00:01:46,446
Just relax.

31
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:48,381
If you do the work
and I like it,

32
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:50,250
I guarantee that Raymond
will fall in line.

33
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,783
I have that power.

34
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:53,385
And if you don't like our work?

35
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:55,654
Raymond never has to know.

36
00:01:55,722 --> 00:01:57,456
I don't know if that
solves my problem.

37
00:01:57,524 --> 00:01:59,958
Look, I understand your risk.

38
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,660
Or we could have met
in your office again.

39
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:04,896
In fact, we can have
the presentation here, too.

40
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:06,398
No, we'll get a hotel.

41
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:10,901
I am supposed to be meeting
someone in about 20 minutes

42
00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,570
and she likes me
to wait for her.

43
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,609
Well, take your time.

44
00:02:17,676 --> 00:02:19,744
And remember,

45
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,546
I don't need much of an
excuse to come to Manhattan.

46
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:39,095
When I say a small team,
I mean Stan.

47
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:40,963
Just the three of us.

48
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,865
We bill it under Project K.

49
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:46,335
Nice place.

50
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:49,004
Well, it's available to you.

51
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:52,308
You know, if you ever have to
spend the night in the city.

52
00:02:52,376 --> 00:02:53,976
I live here, Pete.

53
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:04,152
It's been 7:00
for 20 minutes.

54
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,120
I'm starving.

55
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:08,623
I'm sorry I'm late,
but I have a job.

56
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,958
You know what, Dawn?
You have another job,

57
00:03:11,026 --> 00:03:12,526
which is being
my maid of honor.

58
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:15,028
Well, I can't lose
that one, can I?

59
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:18,131
Well, I have some bad news.

60
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,100
Al called me

61
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:22,469
and he said both the caterer
and your date fell through.

62
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,005
William?
What happened?

63
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,207
Al doesn't think
he's ready to settle down.

64
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,309
And he didn't want you to spend
the night defending yourself.

65
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,143
You tell Al to keep looking

66
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,145
because I'm never gonna meet
someone at that office.

67
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,380
Al and I met at church.

68
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,148
Church is impossible.

69
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,584
You can't stand out
in that crowd of harlots.

70
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,288
You stand out.

71
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:44,723
You must run into
somebody downtown.

72
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,559
I get on the train
and it's just us...

73
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,529
and then it gets thinner
and thinner until about 72nd.

74
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,931
Sometimes it's just me
and this old shoeshine--

75
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:54,800
and he won't even look at me.

76
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,202
Bea Carter says her son
Anthony ran into you.

77
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,637
But that's what
you don't understand.

78
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:01,639
We were walking
through the plaza

79
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,708
and we passed each other
and we just nodded.

80
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,776
Someone told me he said that,

81
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,911
but he didn't talk to me.

82
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:09,613
And I didn't talk
to him, either.

83
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:14,284
Well, I'll keep looking.

84
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,288
That might be too much blush.

85
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:22,191
If you look a little rusty,
it's 'cause I'm a little rusty.

86
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,327
I need all the help I can get.

87
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:26,896
The makeup's
not the important part.

88
00:04:26,964 --> 00:04:30,132
Mary Kay always says it's really
about making yourself feel better,

89
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,702
and that starts with
doing something for you.

90
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,303
Well, that'll be a first.

91
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,376
- Kate!
- Shh, I just put the baby down.

92
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:46,314
- You have not changed.
- Well, you have.

93
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:48,416
How did you suddenly
get younger than me?

94
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,884
Because she's in
the beauty business.

95
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,753
What do you think?

96
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,154
- How much did she spend?
- It's free.

97
00:04:54,222 --> 00:04:56,724
This is my old stuff.
I'm a sales director now.

98
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,626
- How are your boys?
- Good.

99
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:00,561
- Did you see Kevin?
- She looked in.

100
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:03,163
Why don't we let him sleep
while we eat dinner?

101
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:04,631
I made a pork roast.

102
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:07,233
And I made reservations
at Le Cirque for two.

103
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:10,336
Well, I want to catch up.
And, more importantly,

104
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:13,172
Kate has a job interview tomorrow
and I don't want her tying one on.

105
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,375
- Who are you meeting with?
- The competition.

106
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:17,343
Can we take a raincheck?

107
00:05:17,412 --> 00:05:19,478
Splendid.

108
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,747
She hasn't changed.

109
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,991
Why are you getting on
the elevator going up?

110
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,327
Because the door opened
and you were standing there.

111
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,030
I pressed down.

112
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,840
Where have you been?

113
00:05:48,908 --> 00:05:51,075
I missed you.

114
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,076
Working all the time.
Don't tell anyone.

115
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,712
Like who?

116
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,348
Arnie's on call
Thursday or Friday.

117
00:05:58,416 --> 00:06:00,551
I'll leave a penny under the
mat when he's flown the coop.

118
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:11,994
I have to go.

119
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,333
Can you be more specific?

120
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,703
Nope.

121
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:22,572
Good night.

122
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:35,517
Dennis must be doing well.

123
00:06:35,585 --> 00:06:37,953
- That's from the company.
- My goodness.

124
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,553
What do you have to do
to get this?

125
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,889
Just have a lot of my recruits
sell a lot of Mary Kay.

126
00:06:41,957 --> 00:06:43,724
How much?
Those are diamonds.

127
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,425
Just has to be the most.

128
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:47,060
They know what they're doing.

129
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:48,929
I know.
They do.

130
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:51,131
But there's no way
for me to move up there.

131
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,700
So is that why
you're going to Avon?

132
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,401
There's women
above me at Mary Kay,

133
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:56,536
It's just working
out of Spokane,

134
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:59,205
there's only so far I can go.

135
00:06:59,272 --> 00:07:01,641
Well, Joanie's a partner
and I don't know if anyone

136
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,510
would want all that
extra responsibility.

137
00:07:03,577 --> 00:07:05,678
You should visit more often.

138
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:07,413
Turns out
someone's proud of me.

139
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:09,382
I'm a monster.

140
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,384
Believe it or not,
"My daughter is a partner

141
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:14,720
at a Madison Avenue
advertising firm"

142
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:17,155
is something I enjoy saying.

143
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:18,557
It does sound pretty good.

144
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:26,464
Well, so much for keeping
my wits about me.

145
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,866
I should be getting
back to the Waldorf.

146
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:30,768
Well, I wish you
the best of luck tomorrow.

147
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:32,069
But if worse come to worse,

148
00:07:32,137 --> 00:07:33,838
you're appreciated somewhere.

149
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:41,111
What are the "Life" magazine
closing dates for Birds Eye?

150
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:43,980
Ken, it's Monday.

151
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,182
I got a perfect cup of coffee
and a Danish on the way.

152
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,284
You want to start with "Good morning?
How was your weekend?"

153
00:07:48,352 --> 00:07:51,821
I spent it with my in-laws
listening to Ed complain

154
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,490
about how much the world
hates Dow Chemical.

155
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:57,260
And I know that every gripe he has
is directed at me and this company.

156
00:07:57,327 --> 00:08:00,429
Is it possible that this has turned
Ken Cosgrove into a neurotic?

157
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:02,264
If he wants people
to stop hating him,

158
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:05,868
he should stop dropping
napalm on children.

159
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:09,271
I know you just came
here to complain,

160
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,106
but I actually think
that I can help you.

161
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:13,442
God, that's really true.

162
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:15,477
I just came in here
to complain.

163
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:17,344
How hard would it be to meet
with Ed, just you and me?

164
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:19,814
If I have a good reason?

165
00:08:19,882 --> 00:08:21,749
I'm sorry, Mr. Cosgrove,
but it's the last one.

166
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,184
- Did you find your keys?
- I did.

167
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:25,152
Can you get Pierre
Cossette on the line?

168
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,754
I have an idea.
Let's see what happens.

169
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:28,355
Harry has great ideas.

170
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,642
I saw this thing on a spy show.

171
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,177
It's a clock
with a tiny camera in it.

172
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:55,114
All we have to do
is get it in there.

173
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,116
If you can get in,
you don't need a clock.

174
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:00,586
I would guess
it's a military account.

175
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:02,622
And I would guess
they picked Stan

176
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:04,255
because he has no conscience.

177
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:08,159
So Project K stands for what?

178
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:10,428
Project Kill Machine!

179
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:11,963
That's not what it stands for.

180
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:15,433
So what does
it stand for, Bobby?

181
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,335
I don't know what it is.

182
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:19,137
Are you saying that because
you <i>do</i> know what it is?

183
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:20,671
No.

184
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:23,340
- Stan come through?
- Stan who?

185
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:26,309
I know one thing-- he's not in
a room with tinfoil on the windows.

186
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:28,178
How are things, Don?

187
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,024
There's nothing in here.

188
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:42,825
'Cause you're gonna
fill it with work.

189
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:44,994
- If you don't fall asleep.
- Mmm.

190
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:49,131
I'm telling you,
it clears the cobwebs.

191
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:06,246
I think a hot dog and a
hamburger are too similar.

192
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:10,217
Plus, a hot dog
cries out for mustard.

193
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:13,587
No, I think a hot dog
cries out for ketchup.

194
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,224
A squiggly line.

195
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,496
Hmm.

196
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:24,531
I think we should order lunch.

197
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:33,373
Mmm.

198
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:36,141
My goodness. Someone's having
a party and didn't invite us.

199
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,544
I don't know what
you're talking about.

200
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:41,214
Is Clara's birthday today?

201
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:43,916
It's tomorrow
and it's $2 a head.

202
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:45,951
And, actually, I don't know
what I'm going to get.

203
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:48,221
- Do you want to come?
- I can't.

204
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:50,255
Mr. Draper
always needs me.

205
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:52,757
Could you punch me out
when you leave?

206
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:54,526
Really?

207
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:57,962
How long are you
going to be gone?

208
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,797
Well, if you punch me out...

209
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,101
Okay.

210
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,537
I heard Mr. Draper's
in there.

211
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:09,273
No.

212
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,078
- Did you get the pages?
- No.

213
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:16,714
Are you two rehearsing already?

214
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,582
Call me when you see them.

215
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,217
Arlene, are you sad
it's not you?

216
00:11:20,285 --> 00:11:22,018
You know Mel is my husband.

217
00:11:22,086 --> 00:11:23,919
I could have him write you
into a hospital bed

218
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,388
or a grave.

219
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:32,729
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:37,268 --> 00:11:38,667
What's going on?

221
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:42,638
Well, you're going to have
a love scene with Rod.

222
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:45,407
And between you, me, and
soon a national audience,

223
00:11:45,475 --> 00:11:46,742
it's more of a love affair.

224
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,344
Oh, my goodness.

225
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:51,112
That's so exciting.

226
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,014
Thank you for telling me.

227
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:54,282
Oh, I did more than tell you.

228
00:11:54,349 --> 00:11:56,317
Mel's been on the fence,

229
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:58,986
but I think he really
believes in you.

230
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,688
Now, don't embarrass me.

231
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,189
You've done this
before, haven't you?

232
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,825
Um, well, of course.

233
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:07,828
Does a high school play count?

234
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:09,196
No.

235
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,231
It's gonna be exciting at first

236
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,433
and then it'll be
part of the job.

237
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,169
It's pretty exciting.

238
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,906
The hard part is how "James
Garner" there will deal with it.

239
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,875
Some people think it's better to
wait till after it's happened

240
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:26,078
or not tell them at all, but I
think it's best to be up front.

241
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,383
Well, obviously
he's not going to like it.

242
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,352
Would you be upset if he did?

243
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,355
I don't know.

244
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,291
Why don't Mel and I take
you two out to dinner?

245
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,027
You know, to make
him comfortable.

246
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,295
And, honestly, all of us
should be better acquainted.

247
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,864
I mean, Mel has
big plans for you.

248
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,939
I'm gonna leave
you alone with these.

249
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:07,684
- Did you send Scarlett somewhere?
- No, Meredith.

250
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:10,587
Well, it's just I can't
find her or Mr. Crane

251
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:11,888
and there's someone to see him.

252
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:13,156
I'm dying for you to meet Ken.

253
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:19,061
How are you?

254
00:13:19,128 --> 00:13:20,730
Busy.

255
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,633
Have Scarlett see me
when you find her.

256
00:13:30,973 --> 00:13:33,908
Oh, good.
You're home on time.

257
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:36,344
I am. It's only because
I have a lot of work

258
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:38,246
and I don't want to do
it in a windowless room.

259
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,885
So why don't you have a seat?

260
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:45,286
I'm gonna get you a drink.

261
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:48,054
And then I'm gonna
stuff you with coq au vin.

262
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:51,692
I know you're very busy,

263
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,629
but I want us to have,
I don't know--

264
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:58,665
I want us to be able to talk
about things other than work.

265
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,501
Megan, what happened?

266
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:02,869
Just once I'd like
to be that wife

267
00:14:02,936 --> 00:14:05,838
that lays a trap and has her
husband walk right into it.

268
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:08,841
Okay, first of all, Arlene,

269
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:10,777
you know, she plays
Penelope Aldridge.

270
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:12,912
She basically owns
"Berkshire Falls."

271
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:15,281
She's married to Mel
the head writer

272
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:17,316
and they want to have
dinner with us.

273
00:14:17,384 --> 00:14:18,650
Does it get worse?

274
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:24,756
Well, my storyline
is getting more developed

275
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:27,025
and that means

276
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:29,227
I'm gonna have
a series of love scenes.

277
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:31,596
- With whom?
- With Rod Holly.

278
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,932
He plays Rafe Jackson.
He's Arlene's nephew.

279
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,900
Megan, I don't care.

280
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,636
What's a "love scene"
consist of?

281
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:41,305
It's just kissing and hugging.

282
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:44,308
It's TV. We can't
really do anything.

283
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:48,546
What am I supposed to say?

284
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,848
That you trust me.

285
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:55,517
And that you know
it's part of my job.

286
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:59,188
And maybe that it was bound to
happen if things went well.

287
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:01,090
Keep going. I'm dying to
hear what I say next.

288
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:02,325
Should I have
hidden it from you?

289
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:07,729
I don't know, Megan.
I need to think about it.

290
00:15:09,298 --> 00:15:11,799
Look, I know
I wouldn't like it,

291
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,402
but I'd look
on the bright side.

292
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,638
Okay, I guess if I
wasn't your husband,

293
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:19,107
I would be happy for you.

294
00:15:19,175 --> 00:15:21,009
It does mean they like you.

295
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:23,410
Do you like me?

296
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:26,513
Honey, I can tolerate this,
but I can't encourage it.

297
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:29,616
You're perfect.

298
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,927
And, honestly, Ed, it's not just Ken
who's been losing sleep about this.

299
00:15:38,995 --> 00:15:40,563
<i>I mean, last week when half of
Colombia got into your lobby--</i>

300
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,098
It was 15 people.

301
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,867
Look, you've been in
the news every other day

302
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:47,602
and a couple of articles
placed in business journals

303
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,003
are not going
to make that stop.

304
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:51,539
They acted like they
were storming the Bastille.

305
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,341
This is their country, too.

306
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:56,511
What exactly is your point?

307
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,446
Pierre.

308
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:01,882
A one-hour prime-time TV
special sponsored by Dow,

309
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,318
starring Joe Namath and 15
or so of his best friends

310
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:07,521
putting on a show drawing from
America's most beloved musicals.

311
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,923
"Broadway Joe
on Broadway."

312
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,191
Joe Namath sings?

313
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:13,760
Don't you want to watch
it just to find out?

314
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:16,863
And who are his "friends"?

315
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:18,998
I have access to the
greatest talent available.

316
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,567
There'll be sex appeal. Joey
Heatherton, for example.

317
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:24,170
Pipes, Julie Andrews.
And punch.

318
00:16:24,238 --> 00:16:27,339
How about John Wayne in a
sketch version of "Camelot"?

319
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:29,842
We're mostly
household products.

320
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:31,143
Women don't like football.

321
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:33,078
Have you ever asked them
about Joe Namath?

322
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:34,880
Forget demographics.

323
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:37,750
How would you like Dow to be
responsible for making people smile?

324
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:41,220
And is there anything
that makes people smile

325
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:42,987
more than Broadway
and football?

326
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:44,822
"Yankee Doodle Dandy" and
the Notre Dame fight song

327
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,657
playing at the same time.

328
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:49,393
♪ I'm a Yankee
Doodle Dandy... ♪

329
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,528
♪ Yankee Doddle, do or die... ♪

330
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,965
Okay, okay.

331
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:56,700
Kenny, did you tell them
I went to Notre Dame?

332
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,002
No, I told them
about Joey Heatherton.

333
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:03,573
So it's tailor-made
for us?

334
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,342
What's our commitment?

335
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,978
Well, you'd be a corner tenant.

336
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:10,046
There's six minutes
of commercials in the hour,

337
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,816
you'd get three and then
two 10-second billboards

338
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:15,151
at the beginning
and end of the show.

339
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:16,919
"Brought to you
by Dow Chemical,

340
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:19,021
family products
for the American family."

341
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:25,761
Just imagine
Joe Namath in a straw hat.

342
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,039
I'm sorry
to bother you, Scarlett,

343
00:17:38,107 --> 00:17:40,275
but is Mr. Crane in?

344
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:43,311
Okay.
No, he's in a meeting.

345
00:17:43,378 --> 00:17:44,745
Is there something
I can help you with?

346
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,480
Well, if he's expecting
any special guests,

347
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:50,383
you should let us know because he had someone
come yesterday and you weren't here.

348
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:52,752
I must have been
in the ladies' room.

349
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,723
No, and it's strange because
you didn't leave until 6:47.

350
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,926
Oh, Joan, it's Clara's
birthday today

351
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:01,261
and I tried to go at lunch,
but I got stuck at my desk.

352
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,595
So I left Mr. Crane
on his own

353
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:05,331
while I attended
to this company business.

354
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:10,536
We got her a Givenchy
scarf from Gimbels.

355
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:13,339
I have the card here
for you to sign.

356
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:15,975
But you never came back and you
had Dawn punch your time card.

357
00:18:16,043 --> 00:18:17,743
No, Dawn and I
were working together.

358
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,811
But we were all over the place.

359
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:22,981
But mostly in accounting.

360
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:25,250
Thank you for clearing that up.

361
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,960
Dawn.

362
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:38,028
Have you spoken
to Scarlett this morning?

363
00:18:38,096 --> 00:18:40,898
We're missing the big hole punch and I
think you were the last one to see her.

364
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:43,067
The hole punch
is in the creative lounge.

365
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:45,535
Dawn, Scarlett
told me everything.

366
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:50,174
Scarlett, you're fired.

367
00:18:52,877 --> 00:18:55,945
Joan, please.
It won't happen again.

368
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:58,814
Not here it won't.
Go get your things.

369
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:00,516
<i>Dawn, could you get Stan in here</i>

370
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,718
- <i>before the partners meeting?</i>
- I'll deal with you later.

371
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:08,323
Girls do it all the time.

372
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:10,392
Just go before you really
embarrass yourself.

373
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:18,367
I hope you realize this means
now you're on Ed's radar.

374
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:20,369
So will I be invited
to Sunday dinner?

375
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:21,937
Something like that.

376
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:26,374
I don't know where you're going, but
I want you to bring back champagne.

377
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:29,777
Oh, Harry, I'm not coming back.

378
00:19:29,844 --> 00:19:31,112
What are you talking about?

379
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,483
Joan, you owe
Scarlett an apology.

380
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,552
Harry, please don't
involve yourself in this.

381
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,720
I'm tired of your
petty dictatorship.

382
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:43,790
So whatever capital crime or treason
she committed, she's in my department.

383
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:46,226
I didn't realize you were
that attached to Scarlett.

384
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:48,895
- We're not attached.
- We are attached!

385
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:50,931
I have something
more important to do.

386
00:19:50,998 --> 00:19:52,799
I would hope you do, too.

387
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,369
Scarlett, do whatever
you think is best.

388
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,704
You are to do
whatever <i>I</i> think is best.

389
00:20:10,283 --> 00:20:11,849
Let's go.
Back to work.

390
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:13,717
Everything's fine.

391
00:20:21,293 --> 00:20:23,061
I understand
the confidentiality,

392
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:24,562
but I need to know
how to bill Project K.

393
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,134
Don't.

394
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:32,769
Meredith, why
don't you step out?

395
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,442
I don't know what she said because I'm
not privy to these conversations,

396
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:39,809
but I would like the chance
to defend myself.

397
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:42,045
- Mr. Crane, I haven't--
- No, please.

398
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:44,213
<i>Let him go on.</i>

399
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:49,685
Well, it's this simple-- Scarlett works
for me and Joan tried to fire her.

400
00:20:49,752 --> 00:20:51,854
She left work early and had
Dawn punch her time card.

401
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:53,822
It's pay for a minimum
of five hours of work

402
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,625
that she didn't do
that we are paying for.

403
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:58,594
Well, it's either me or her.

404
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:01,062
- Joan?
- Scarlett.

405
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,632
I think you mean,
"If she goes, I go."

406
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,634
"Broadway Joe
on Broadway."

407
00:21:06,702 --> 00:21:09,604
Is there anybody in here
who thought of that?

408
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:12,240
- I did.
- What the hell is that?

409
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:15,275
It's $150,000 worth
of incremental business

410
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:18,178
I generated while solving a problem.
For what?

411
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:20,814
So I can stand outside that glass
and watch you all in here?

412
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,083
- What did Dawn do?
- Well, I'm almost positive--

413
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:25,252
Just keep talking to her
because she's a partner.

414
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:28,055
You know what?

415
00:21:28,123 --> 00:21:30,057
I'm sorry my accomplishments
happened in broad daylight

416
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,525
and I can't be given
the same rewards.

417
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,160
What is that supposed to mean?

418
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,662
You know damn well.

419
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,963
The next time this group
is called to order,

420
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:39,798
I expect to be sitting
at this table.

421
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,168
I've actually earned it.

422
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,450
Don't worry, dear.
That's not going to happen.

423
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:01,553
Joan, I don't want to put myself
in the same camp as Harry,

424
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,620
but I might remind you
and everyone

425
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:06,390
the Commission on Human Rights
is continuing to investigate

426
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,026
our industry regarding
the employment of Negroes.

427
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,062
She's a good secretary.

428
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,896
Of course.

429
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,932
What about Scarlett?

430
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,102
I think this humiliation
will suffice.

431
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,869
Can we continue
with the billings?

432
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:21,837
Yes.

433
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:23,339
Where were we?

434
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:28,211
"Meredith, why don't you
step out?"

435
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,080
Well?

436
00:22:30,147 --> 00:22:32,082
Oh.

437
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:42,607
I'm sorry,
but I couldn't leave.

438
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:45,343
I don't care as long as you
brought those bridal magazines.

439
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,178
What is wrong with you?

440
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:49,647
I had a day today that
pushed your stupid wedding

441
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:51,048
to the bottom of the list.

442
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:53,017
- Did you get fired?
- No.

443
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:54,985
I don't think so.

444
00:22:55,052 --> 00:22:56,920
Who can tell at that place?

445
00:22:56,988 --> 00:22:58,888
What happened?

446
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:00,857
One of the girls
asked me to punch out

447
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:02,726
her time card
and we got caught.

448
00:23:02,793 --> 00:23:04,894
I told you, those girls
aren't your friends.

449
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:07,030
Yes, they are. She got
in more trouble than me.

450
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:09,132
Why do you think she asked you?

451
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,367
You can't say no
'cause you're too scared.

452
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:12,868
All they see is,
"Yes, sir."

453
00:23:12,936 --> 00:23:14,470
Everybody's scared there.

454
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:16,939
Women crying
in the ladies' room.

455
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:18,608
Men crying in the elevator.

456
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:21,210
It sounds like New Year's Eve
when they empty the garbage,

457
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:23,078
<i>there are so many bottles.</i>

458
00:23:23,147 --> 00:23:26,114
And I told you about that poor man
hanging himself in his office.

459
00:23:26,182 --> 00:23:27,982
Oh, they got it so bad,

460
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,084
they must all
be jealous of you.

461
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:32,887
What am I gonna do? Throw a
brick through their window?

462
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:36,958
I want to keep my job,

463
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:39,027
so I'm gonna keep my head down.

464
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:41,562
Well, I couldn't do it.

465
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,864
Well, you don't have to.

466
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:45,132
You're getting married.

467
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:48,569
And dinner.

468
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,939
<i>I should have brought Dennis.</i>

469
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:55,142
You're not even
listening to me.

470
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,110
I'm sorry.
I need a drink

471
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:58,811
and this place
is a soda fountain.

472
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:01,681
I feel like I'm in high school
right down to the clientele.

473
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:06,085
Hello?

474
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:09,322
We're sitting here waiting
for a phone to ring.

475
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,523
This actually is high school.

476
00:24:10,591 --> 00:24:12,192
So what do you do to have fun?

477
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,292
I don't look in a guidebook.

478
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,394
This wasn't in
a guidebook, okay?

479
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:17,028
My friend told me about it.

480
00:24:17,096 --> 00:24:19,931
Is she a nun or just the
right age for this place?

481
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,902
Apparently there are
quite a few men here

482
00:24:23,969 --> 00:24:25,671
who go for a certain type.

483
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,307
Oh.

484
00:24:28,374 --> 00:24:30,741
Joanie, don't judge me.
I'm in New York.

485
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:39,783
Good evening, ladies.

486
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:41,652
If there's anything you need,
I'll be over there.

487
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,721
Catherine's got a lot
of tables, so don't hesitate.

488
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:45,655
I'm Leo.

489
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:48,391
I'm Kate.
And this is Joan.

490
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:55,232
Actually, I don't think
our phone is working.

491
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,101
- Can you test it?
- I'll see what I can do.

492
00:25:00,904 --> 00:25:03,805
How many girls come in here and
complain that their phones are broken?

493
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:06,609
He's cute.
Reminds me of Scotty.

494
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:08,310
Well, don't marry him.

495
00:25:08,378 --> 00:25:10,212
That was the worst
six months of my life.

496
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,047
You always did
everything first.

497
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:14,383
But you did everything smart.

498
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:17,553
Well, tonight we're just
a couple of young secretaries.

499
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,823
Answer it.

500
00:25:23,893 --> 00:25:25,693
Ahem.
Hello?

501
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,295
How did you do that?

502
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:28,897
I didn't do anything.
He likes you.

503
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:30,899
What?

504
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:33,601
Oh.

505
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:35,570
Just a minute.
Let me ask my girlfriend.

506
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:37,438
He wants us to meet him
after his shift.

507
00:25:37,506 --> 00:25:38,973
Well, tell him
you know a place.

508
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,175
But I don't.
Do you?

509
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:43,444
- Should I invite him to my room?
- No.

510
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:45,813
We were just trying
to think of a place.

511
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,114
Tell him to think of a place.

512
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:48,849
Do you know of a place?

513
00:25:48,917 --> 00:25:50,550
Oh, good.

514
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:53,320
- Hang up.
- Till then.

515
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:56,923
Okay, now I need a drink.

516
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,828
Do you honestly believe
a few jokes

517
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:04,564
on the "Smothers Brothers"
are really upsetting people?

518
00:26:04,632 --> 00:26:06,599
<i>I think it's the sponsors</i>
<i>and the network</i>

519
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,867
don't want to have
a conversation about the war.

520
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:12,070
I'd like to have an evening without
a conversation about the war.

521
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:14,540
<i>Darling, you</i>
<i>shouldn't smoke so much.</i>

522
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:16,475
The weight you lose
isn't worth the wrinkles.

523
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:18,644
<i>See, I think the sponsors</i>
<i>are for the war.</i>

524
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:20,713
They don't want to have
any dissent.

525
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:23,748
Don, you're a writer.
You know this is censorship.

526
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,418
I am a writer
and I'm against the war,

527
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:29,721
but when you buy a commercial,

528
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,323
you're hoping that the consumer

529
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,990
is in a good mood when
they hear your message.

530
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,127
So if you agree on
a wholesome variety show

531
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:38,062
and all of a sudden
it's filled with satire--

532
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,364
the most threatening
humor there is--

533
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,066
you're worried about people
hating what you're selling.

534
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,305
Megan, let's talk about you

535
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,375
and how you found this man.

536
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,477
I could cast
you, you know that.

537
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:57,747
Yes, I'm sure he is a man
who plays many roles.

538
00:26:57,815 --> 00:27:01,050
Luckily you don't have
to worry about censorship

539
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:04,019
with the show
because it's so tame.

540
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,155
<i>Of course it's for
daytime entertainment.</i>

541
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:07,990
It's for housewives.

542
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,826
It has to be
a little titillating.

543
00:27:10,893 --> 00:27:12,828
<i>We have our own standards.</i>

544
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:14,596
Although they've been
very liberal with us.

545
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,833
But, you know,

546
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,868
when we do things on the show,

547
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:22,036
it's all very tasteful.

548
00:27:22,104 --> 00:27:23,705
Well, it's not real life.

549
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:29,276
Why don't you let me
get the check?

550
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:32,012
We go back to our pad,
smoke some grass,

551
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,782
and... see
what happens.

552
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,317
Sounds like fun.

553
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:39,687
I don't know.
It's late.

554
00:27:39,755 --> 00:27:41,689
It's not.

555
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:43,757
Look, if you don't
smoke grass, that's fine.

556
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:46,659
It's not everything
we had in mind.

557
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:48,428
I'm not sure if I understand.

558
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:51,931
We like Megan.

559
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:54,133
And we like <i>you.</i>

560
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:56,770
And we'd like to be friends.

561
00:27:56,837 --> 00:27:58,570
Us, too.

562
00:28:01,508 --> 00:28:03,275
Well, then...

563
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:08,013
I guess it's not impossible
under the right circumstances

564
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,049
for us to become
better acquainted.

565
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,554
Hey, it may not work.
It's a chemistry experiment.

566
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:19,324
I have a big day tomorrow.
You both know that.

567
00:28:19,392 --> 00:28:21,960
That's work.
This is play.

568
00:28:22,028 --> 00:28:23,728
I have to get up very early.

569
00:28:23,796 --> 00:28:25,430
That's what
black coffee is for.

570
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,198
I make it delicious.

571
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:29,667
Uh...

572
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:31,568
maybe another time.

573
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:34,805
Arlene, we've heard
"no" before.

574
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:37,107
I guess there's no reason
to skip dessert.

575
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,180
What?

576
00:28:44,882 --> 00:28:46,850
This is the best seat.

577
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:49,018
St. Marks between
2nd and 3rd, please.

578
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:53,856
Have you been to
the Electric Circus?

579
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:56,025
- All the time.
- We're from out of town.

580
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,963
Let's see who kisses better.

581
00:29:01,832 --> 00:29:03,198
I'm not playing this game.

582
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:04,599
Because she'll lose.

583
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:26,153
What the hell was that?

584
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:27,921
What? They like you
and they like me.

585
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,024
They'd like us to be friends.

586
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:32,426
They were so out in the open.

587
00:29:32,494 --> 00:29:34,828
It was a good strategy.
I kept thinking

588
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:37,330
he was going to ask me for a
job directing commercials.

589
00:29:37,398 --> 00:29:39,399
Maybe he was waiting
for tomorrow morning

590
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,701
- when we were basking in the afterglow.
- Don't.

591
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:44,304
Just a pile of arms and legs.

592
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:47,007
I don't know whether
to laugh or be sick

593
00:29:47,074 --> 00:29:49,109
because now I think

594
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:51,110
that's the reason
they gave me the scene.

595
00:29:51,177 --> 00:29:52,511
I'm sure they've tried that

596
00:29:52,578 --> 00:29:54,480
with plenty of people
who haven't gotten scenes.

597
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:58,417
Don, I have to go
back to work with them.

598
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:01,387
It'll be better than ever.
How long have they been married?

599
00:30:01,454 --> 00:30:03,955
18 years.

600
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:21,739
I'm busy.

601
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:24,374
Come up for air.

602
00:30:24,442 --> 00:30:26,576
Oh, hey.

603
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:29,446
Would you mind?

604
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:37,521
This is my friend.

605
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:39,922
I'm Johnny.

606
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:42,724
Joan. Pleased to meet you.

607
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:45,027
Johnny and Joan.

608
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,996
Bonnie and Clyde.

609
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,368
- Do you want a drink?
- I have one.

610
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:57,004
<i>♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪</i>

611
00:30:59,542 --> 00:31:01,642
What'd I say?

612
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:06,081
What did he say?

613
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:08,683
He said I'd want you.

614
00:31:18,393 --> 00:31:21,128
<i>♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪</i>

615
00:31:23,164 --> 00:31:26,633
<i>♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪</i>

616
00:31:26,701 --> 00:31:29,034
Well, war or no war,

617
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:31,804
Nixon doesn't think he's
running against Johnson.

618
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:34,607
He thinks he's running against
the ghost of Kennedy.

619
00:31:34,674 --> 00:31:36,976
So does Johnson.

620
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:39,178
I don't know where Helen is.

621
00:31:39,246 --> 00:31:40,513
How are you both this morning?

622
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:43,082
Frankly, we're a little
embarrassed.

623
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:46,684
Well, if that has anything to do with me, I apologize.
That was not my intention.

624
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:48,653
How are Jennifer,
Bea, and the twins?

625
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:50,088
It's Nathan and Steven, right?

626
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,725
Yes.

627
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,260
They're well, thank you.

628
00:31:56,895 --> 00:31:58,930
That display
yesterday of--

629
00:31:58,998 --> 00:32:01,332
well, of initiative

630
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:02,466
really caught our attention.

631
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:08,005
This is a check for $23,500.

632
00:32:08,072 --> 00:32:10,574
That's the full commission
on "Broadway Joe."

633
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:13,644
Well, thank you.

634
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:16,045
That's a lot of money.

635
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:21,651
So, anything else to say?

636
00:32:21,718 --> 00:32:25,087
I'm puzzled. What do you
make a year, Mr. Crane?

637
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:27,422
22. So what about
the partnership?

638
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,959
You want some of the spoils.
Well, there you go.

639
00:32:30,027 --> 00:32:31,994
We have to get bigger
before we get bigger.

640
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:34,096
What a load of crap.

641
00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:36,265
- You know, Joan's not even in yet.
- Leave her out of this.

642
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:38,133
Bert, you know
how important I am

643
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,634
to this company.
You were me.

644
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:43,938
I was different than you,
Mr. Crane, in every way.

645
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:48,677
- So you don't want the money?
- No, I've earned the money.

646
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:52,047
But I've also earned
a partnership.

647
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:54,815
I really hope some other firm
doesn't figure that out first.

648
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:00,688
That was the most
impressive thing he's done.

649
00:33:00,755 --> 00:33:02,723
Should we fire him
before he cashes that check?

650
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:12,167
- Aren't you gonna be late?
- Aren't <i>you?</i>

651
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:21,943
I love you.

652
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,344
Wish me luck.

653
00:33:32,987 --> 00:33:34,720
Good luck.

654
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:51,070
I'm really waking
you this time.

655
00:33:51,137 --> 00:33:53,172
Kate.

656
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,440
Honey, wake up.

657
00:33:54,507 --> 00:33:56,875
Now you two layabouts
have to bathe him.

658
00:33:56,943 --> 00:33:58,243
I have an appointment.

659
00:33:58,311 --> 00:34:00,079
Mom, I'm still going to work.

660
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:02,014
Do you need to throw up?

661
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,082
Mother, can you
give us a minute?

662
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,724
Why did I do that?

663
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:16,361
You had some fun.

664
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,896
I just wanted to try it.

665
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,898
Now you'll go home and you'll find
everything right where it belongs.

666
00:34:23,234 --> 00:34:25,735
I'm really not you, am I?

667
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:28,405
Why would you want to be?

668
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:30,440
Are you kidding?

669
00:34:30,508 --> 00:34:33,410
Look what you did.

670
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:35,479
You came out here,

671
00:34:35,546 --> 00:34:38,514
you staked this out
on your own.

672
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:40,849
I always had Dennis
to fall back on.

673
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:43,619
Even when I went to Mary Kay.

674
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:45,554
You didn't.

675
00:34:47,157 --> 00:34:49,091
And I never will.

676
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,927
How'd that happen?

677
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:55,863
The whole reason
I even talked to Avon

678
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:58,500
is because I wanted...

679
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:02,003
I don't know,

680
00:35:02,071 --> 00:35:04,406
what you have.

681
00:35:04,473 --> 00:35:06,474
It's not what you think.

682
00:35:06,509 --> 00:35:07,742
You're an executive.

683
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,543
It's a title.

684
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,278
And money.

685
00:35:11,312 --> 00:35:13,980
I've been working there
for 15 years

686
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:16,550
and they still treat
me like a secretary.

687
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:18,919
What's it have to do with them?

688
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,021
You're there, Joan.

689
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:24,424
And from where I'm sitting,
it's damn impressive.

690
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:26,292
I don't care
how they make you feel,

691
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,561
it's right in front
of you for the taking.

692
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:37,236
I'll be back in an hour.

693
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,174
There you go.

694
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,276
Oh.

695
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,744
Okay, I'll draw the bath.

696
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,216
It's clean, it's simple,

697
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:53,885
and it's tantalizingly
incomplete.

698
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:56,787
What's missing?
One thing.

699
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,659
"Pass the Heinz."

700
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,228
You mean the Heinz Ketchup.

701
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:07,598
It's Heinz.
It only means one thing.

702
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,999
It feels like half an ad.

703
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,335
The greatest thing
you have working for you

704
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,004
is not the photo you take
or the picture you paint.

705
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,107
It's the imagination
of the consumer.

706
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:20,510
They have no budget.
They have no time limit.

707
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,512
And if you can get
into that space,

708
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,047
your ad can run all day.

709
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,251
Well, Pete,
you said I'd say it.

710
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:31,086
<i>It's pretty bold work.</i>

711
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:32,421
I think I still
want to see our bottle.

712
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:34,523
I thought that
at first, too, but--

713
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:37,659
We will test it both ways.

714
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:39,328
It's a testament to ketchup

715
00:36:39,395 --> 00:36:42,030
that there can be no confusion.

716
00:36:42,098 --> 00:36:43,565
Let me chew on it, fellas.

717
00:36:49,904 --> 00:36:51,772
You're going to be thinking
of ketchup all day

718
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,508
and you didn't even see it.

719
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:55,543
Thank you.

720
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:57,311
We'll be in touch.

721
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:07,787
Well, hello.

722
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:09,789
Hello.

723
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:21,233
Ted, you want to come in?

724
00:37:23,303 --> 00:37:25,003
I hope you left us something.

725
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:27,906
Good to see you.

726
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:34,912
It's a bake-off?
Since when?

727
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,685
- Come on, Don.
- Go wait by the elevator.

728
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:44,755
Peggy.

729
00:37:46,758 --> 00:37:50,894
So, what's the difference
between ketchup and catsup?

730
00:37:50,961 --> 00:37:53,263
Well, catsup has more tomatoes,

731
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:55,065
comes in a bigger bottle,

732
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:57,434
is cheaper, but tastes
just like ketchup.

733
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:01,104
Now, we know that's not true,

734
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:03,039
but that's what
your competitors are saying.

735
00:38:03,107 --> 00:38:05,040
<i>Over and over.</i>

736
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:09,312
And they're selling their
watered-down, flavorless sauce

737
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:10,913
by pretending that they're you.

738
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,682
<i>Makes you angry, doesn't it?</i>

739
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,450
Me, too.

740
00:38:15,518 --> 00:38:18,320
But I always say

741
00:38:18,387 --> 00:38:20,288
if you don't like
what they're saying,

742
00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:21,824
change the conversation.

743
00:38:27,996 --> 00:38:31,432
"Heinz.
The only ketchup."

744
00:38:33,168 --> 00:38:35,937
Imagine this 40 feet tall

745
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:37,404
in Times Square.

746
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:41,642
Ketchup versus catsup--

747
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,845
end of conversation.

748
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,288
- Good morning.
- Good afternoon.

749
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,226
Thank you.

750
00:39:11,238 --> 00:39:13,139
Joan, may I have a word?

751
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:29,321
I'm sorry I was not
more forthright with you.

752
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:32,290
I think it would only be
fair if you docked my pay

753
00:39:32,357 --> 00:39:34,425
to cover the hours
Scarlett did not work.

754
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:36,794
Fair to whom?
Scarlett?

755
00:39:36,861 --> 00:39:39,764
I don't know.
Fair to the company?

756
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:48,971
This is the key
to the supply closet

757
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,508
and this is the key
to the time cards.

758
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:54,577
You will be responsible
for monitoring both.

759
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,078
What?

760
00:39:58,282 --> 00:40:00,116
Okay.

761
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:04,020
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

762
00:40:04,087 --> 00:40:06,288
You don't understand
that this is punishment.

763
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:13,395
Well, I don't care
if everybody hates me here

764
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:15,297
as long as you don't.

765
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:17,800
We'll see.

766
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:23,772
So there's two of us.

767
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,941
We're both
the same size agency.

768
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:28,777
You're not afraid of
a little heads-up baseball.

769
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:31,113
I only did it because no one
else was supposed to know.

770
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,281
I think everything
should be done in secret.

771
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:36,451
Lock me in that Project K room,
I'll work on anything, Don.

772
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:38,754
I miss it already.

773
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:44,058
Mind if we join
the Lonely Hearts Club?

774
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,294
Who says we're not celebrating?

775
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,131
J. Walter Thompson.
They bought it in the room.

776
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,868
Are you kidding me?
We paid for that room.

777
00:40:53,936 --> 00:40:56,069
What do you know?

778
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:58,672
The biggest agency
in the world.

779
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,373
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

780
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:03,309
See, I just got off
the phone with Raymond Geiger

781
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,045
and he said that you
were at the Roosevelt

782
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:07,080
giving a presentation
to the ketchup brand manager.

783
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,683
But I said that was impossible
because how could that happen

784
00:41:09,751 --> 00:41:11,351
at my firm without me knowing?

785
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:13,119
Because no one
was supposed to know.

786
00:41:14,955 --> 00:41:17,556
Let me get a rye rocks
and an Old Spanish.

787
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:19,591
I'm sorry, Ken.
Damn it.

788
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,193
I'll call him.
I'll work it out.

789
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:22,795
Don't bother.

790
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:25,497
He doesn't even want
to give us 90 days.

791
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:26,999
There's nothing better than
being known for your loyalty.

792
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:36,575
You hear that, Ted?

793
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:39,077
Vinegars, sauces,
and beans is available.

794
00:41:39,145 --> 00:41:40,979
Help yourself.
It's a gold mine.

795
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:42,947
<i>They'd love that.</i>

796
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:45,883
There's a pie and they
slice it into pieces

797
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,052
and they throw the tiniest
piece into the yard

798
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,120
and let all the small
agencies fight over it.

799
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:52,290
Speak for yourself.

800
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,095
It was worth the risk.

801
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:03,099
I think I see a friend.

802
00:42:13,777 --> 00:42:16,579
Please, Rafe,
you have a family.

803
00:42:16,646 --> 00:42:18,314
I have a family
that ignores me,

804
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:20,482
that treats me like
I've never been there.

805
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,019
But you, you make me
feel new again.

806
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:26,154
I work for you.

807
00:42:26,223 --> 00:42:28,090
And for her.

808
00:42:29,426 --> 00:42:30,759
She's good to me.

809
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:32,560
Stop fighting.

810
00:42:32,628 --> 00:42:33,861
I don't know how much
longer I can take this.

811
00:42:35,397 --> 00:42:36,964
This is your bed
you share with her.

812
00:42:37,032 --> 00:42:38,366
I can't.

813
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:49,343
Rafe, we can't.

814
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,412
<i>Corinne, don't deny this,</i>
<i>what's between us.</i>

815
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,115
<i>Don't deny me when</i>
<i>I know you feel it too.</i>

816
00:42:55,182 --> 00:42:57,284
I do.

817
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:05,124
Rafe.

818
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:07,560
You like to watch, do you?

819
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:10,829
<i>Oh, Rafe.</i>

820
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:12,398
<i>And we're clear.</i>

821
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:15,534
<i>Everyone to</i>
<i>the conservatory set.</i>

822
00:43:15,602 --> 00:43:17,670
- <i>Very nice, everyone.</i>
- You did great.

823
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:19,672
Thank you.

824
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:25,209
Megan, your agent's here.

825
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,520
That was steamy.

826
00:43:38,123 --> 00:43:41,425
So I should go change
and we can go.

827
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,893
I'll keep you company.

828
00:43:53,737 --> 00:43:55,438
What are you doing here?

829
00:43:55,506 --> 00:43:57,307
Because you didn't
want me to see that?

830
00:43:57,374 --> 00:44:00,409
No, and I don't understand why
you'd do that to yourself.

831
00:44:00,476 --> 00:44:03,045
It's a hell of a lot better than
letting my imagination run wild.

832
00:44:05,782 --> 00:44:08,017
The first time you come
to set is for this?

833
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:10,652
I've been here for months. What did
you think was going to happen?

834
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,021
I didn't expect you
to enjoy it.

835
00:44:12,088 --> 00:44:13,655
It's acting, Don.

836
00:44:13,723 --> 00:44:16,124
Were you gonna brush your teeth
at least before you came home?

837
00:44:16,192 --> 00:44:19,427
I'm sick of tiptoeing around you every
time something good happens to me.

838
00:44:19,494 --> 00:44:21,729
This is my job.
No, my career.

839
00:44:21,797 --> 00:44:25,066
You kiss people for money.
You know who does that?

840
00:44:25,134 --> 00:44:28,669
You couldn't stop it, so I guess
ruining it was enough for you.

841
00:44:28,737 --> 00:44:30,571
Would you rather
have not known?

842
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:33,040
You never watch the show. It'd
be like it never happened.

843
00:44:33,107 --> 00:44:35,742
Why don't you have dinner
with Arlene and Mel tonight?

844
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,610
They're much more
open-minded.

845
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:09,440
That's been out there all day.

846
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,113
Was it going to be
out there all night?

847
00:45:15,181 --> 00:45:17,415
Yes.

848
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:38,868
- Take that off.
- Why?

849
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,603
It doesn't mean
anything to you.

850
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,138
It does to you.

851
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,973
It does.

852
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:48,111
So what do you do
when I leave here?

853
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:50,446
Get on your knees
and pray for absolution?

854
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:56,751
I pray for you.

855
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,520
For me to come back?

856
00:45:58,587 --> 00:46:00,722
No.

857
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:06,761
For you to find peace.

858
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,000
