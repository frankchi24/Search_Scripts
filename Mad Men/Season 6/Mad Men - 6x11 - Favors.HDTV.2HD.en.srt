1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,378
<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:05,672
I assumed that we were
forgetting about that.

3
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:07,488
Well, I haven't.

4
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:08,964
His name is Manolo Colón.

5
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,488
He's an army trained
registered nurse.

6
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:14,374
Is he Spanish from Spain?
Because otherwise, Mother will refuse.

7
00:00:14,944 --> 00:00:16,162
You know, we're losing the war.

8
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:18,210
Wouldn't know it
from looking around here.

9
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:20,096
Yeah, it's something, right?

10
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:23,609
I am going to continue on Chevy
evaluating other people's work.

11
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,502
That's all I can do right now.

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,664
Call me around 1970 when
they're ready to make an ad.

13

14
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:26,432
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Mr. Sterling's inside.

15
00:01:27,624 --> 00:01:29,825
- Do you want ice?
- Coffee.

16
00:01:33,964 --> 00:01:36,199
It's one thing to be near the bar,
it's another thing to be under it.

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,944
Sunkist sent us a crate.

18
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:42,013
I've seen blind people juggle, but
somehow it seems to be beyond me.

19
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:43,105
Why don't you
just close your eyes?

20
00:01:43,106 --> 00:01:44,576
That's what you did
in the meeting.

21
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:46,143
Whatever I did, it worked.

22
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:47,809
- We're in it.
- That's good news.

23
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,244
Step one,
I send it to research.

24
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:52,447
Step two, you'll need to get that
little idea factory working.

25
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,249
There's only one angle.

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,384
An orange--
that's orange on TV.

27
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,064
I thought they were pretty clear
they're too cheap to get out of print.

28
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:01,888
So talk 'em out of it,
or into it.

29
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,958
I'd love to, but I think it
demands a media strategy.

30
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,229
Forget research.
Put Harry Crane on it.

31
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,332
- Look at you.
- See?

32
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,500
Not all surprises are bad.

33
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:24,416
The ants,
they look like peoples.

34
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:27,453
He should be right out. Is
there anything I can get you?

35
00:02:27,454 --> 00:02:29,181
I think she would
like a cup of tea.

36
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,949
- In a teacup.
<i>- I'd be more excited</i>

37
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,918
if we didn't have to go
in Ted's plane to present.

38
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,800
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, Peter.

39
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:39,236
Manolo, may I speak
with you a moment?

40
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:41,893
Of course, Mr. Campbell.
Your tea is coming.

41
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:44,328
I'll be fine.
I'm not a child.

42
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,366
Peggy, would you mind?

43
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,671
Mrs. Campbell,
nice to meet you.

44
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,544
There's no reason for you
to be so formal, dear.

45
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:59,109
Sit with me.

46
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:05,216
How are you today?

47
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,150
I can't tell you
how much it relieves me

48
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,452
to see you and Peter reunited.

49
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:12,422
Well, it was really
a by-product of the merger.

50
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:14,558
I'm glad you both
swallowed your pride.

51
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:16,768
If nothing else
but for the good

52
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,036
of the child you have together.

53
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:22,973
Excuse me?

54
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:26,502
Oh, I've embarrassed you.

55
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:29,280
Your son and I are not
together that way.

56
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,207
Trudy, dear, don't deny him.

57
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,475
Don't reject his caresses.

58
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:35,710
Mrs. Campbell--

59
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:38,379
I hope you two can someday find

60
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,120
what Manolo and I have found.

61
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,591
I waited long enough

62
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,761
to experience the physical
satisfactions of love.

63
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,568
Did she go
to China for that tea?

64
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,505
Thank you for driving
her out to Bud's.

65
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,536
I've paid you
for the extra day.

66
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:04,416
- I know you don't drive.
- Well, I do,

67
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:07,806
but not to her satisfaction.

68
00:04:07,807 --> 00:04:10,816
Bob Benson was right about you.
You're worth every penny.

69
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,845
Bob is a wonderful salesman.

70
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:15,648
Still, I want you to have a
little something off the books.

71
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,516
Mr. Campbell,
I refuse.

72
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:19,785
It's important to me
that you treat my mother well,

73
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:21,886
but also
that you treat yourself.

74
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,189
- The pleasure is all mine.
- I know that isn't true.

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,343
Sally, get in here.

76
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:36,134
<i>Hello.</i>

77
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,704
- What?
- Julie's mother called and told me

78
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:43,073
- you were the only two girls on the trip.
- So?

79
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,952
You're not staying in a Midtown
hotel with all those boys.

80
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,878
Miss O'Shea is gonna be there.

81
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,280
She's 25.

82
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,424
What's the point
of having a mansion

83
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,383
if you're gonna spend
all your time in here?

84
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:55,685
Fine, I won't do the Model UN.

85
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:58,336
- It was his idea.
- Fine, you're not going.

86
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:00,739
- Can't we stay with Daddy?
- You mean with no one.

87
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,275
You hate that Daddy
supports my dreams.

88
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:07,178
He doesn't think I'm
just a pain in the ass.

89
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,547
Your father is a hero.

90
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,533
Like everything
else in this country,

91
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:14,850
Diplomacy Club's just
another excuse to make out.

92
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,971
I thought she should join
the Student Congress.

93
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:18,784
The UN's a joke.

94
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:26,048
- Oh, you're home.
- Who's this?

95
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:28,716
This is Mitchell,
Sylvia and Arnold's son.

96
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,321
Nice to finally meet you, Mitchell.
I'm Don.

97
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,559
Thanks again, Megan.

98
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,935
What did he want?

99
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:50,370
Um...

100
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:54,080
I'm sworn to secrecy, but
he's in a lot of trouble.

101
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,651
- What happened?
- He's 1-A.

102
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,580
But he's in school.

103
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:02,464
He sent back his draft card

104
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:05,767
in protest.
They reclassified him.

105
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,335
What did he think
was gonna happen?

106
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:08,455
Stupid kid.

107
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:10,790
Don, he knows he screwed up.

108
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,125
He wants to run.

109
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:16,161
You know, to Canada.

110
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:17,763
I suppose I could
call my brother-in-law,

111
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:19,808
but I can't do that
to Sylvia and Arnold.

112
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:23,068
- Can I?
- Just leave it alone.

113
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:25,471
- He's so scared.
- He should be.

114
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:32,844
He can't spend the rest
of his life on the run.

115
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,394
I know how you feel,

116
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,482
but you don't want him
to go to Vietnam.

117
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,617
Megan, it's not our problem.

118
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,691
Could you get me
another whiskey sour?

119
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:50,660
- Sure.
- Maybe I'll switch to whiskey sours.

120
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,061
How about
a Shirley Temple, then?

121
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:55,136
I don't think Dramamine
and booze go together.

122
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,472
I don't think Dramamine and cranberry
juice go together, either.

123
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:58,940
But I thought we'd be back
on your little plane,

124
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,970
not having a romantic dinner.

125
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:02,848
Don't you want to celebrate?

126
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,072
I want to live, Ted.

127
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:05,674
What?

128
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,777
He doesn't like flying.

129
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,378
Well, you've seen
how simple it is now.

130
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:10,752
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

131
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:14,422
My father died
in a plane... crash.

132
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:17,519
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

133
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,200
Was he a pilot?

134
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:20,869
Ha! No.

135
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,724
Passenger.

136
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:24,064
Look, you're driving.

137
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,827
Can we please, please
have another round?

138
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:28,864
You still have to get home
from White Plains.

139
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,997
I'll hail a cab.

140
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,700
He's such a New Yorker.

141
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,339
This is the agency
I always wanted.

142
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,608
Ambition, brains, and beauty.

143
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:43,744
Yeah, but what about him?

144
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:46,212
I'm gonna cut you
off too, my dear.

145
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,120
I should call home.

146
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,421
If the check comes, I'm
sending it to Ocean Spray.

147
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:01,994
Can you imagine what
it does to his wife

148
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,296
every time he takes that plane?

149
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,397
I guess so.

150
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:09,408
You don't want me
to talk about his wife.

151
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:10,843
You don't know
what you're talking about.

152
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:12,704
But I do.

153
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:15,206
I've seen that look.

154
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,547
I know, but...

155
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,688
nothing can happen.

156
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,882
And he's in love with you, too.

157
00:08:26,688 --> 00:08:28,285
You're the one
who's in love with him.

158
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:30,788
Well, I could use an account
and he's been generous.

159
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:38,230
At least one of us
ended up important.

160
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,201
Please tell me
you don't pity me.

161
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:44,604
I don't.

162
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,073
Because you really know me.

163
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:53,345
I do.

164
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:03,652
Ahem--
I should tell you...

165
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:07,489
I had a very strange
conversation with your mother.

166
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,724
There's no other kind.

167
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,060
Well, it doesn't matter.

168
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:15,968
What did she say?

169
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:19,839
I think she thought
I was your wife

170
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,005
and Manuel was her husband.

171
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:26,272
My father never
treated her that well.

172
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:29,856
Maybe that's it. She thinks
she's in love with him.

173
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:32,191
I can see it.
Manolo is very charming.

174
00:09:32,192 --> 00:09:34,593
I don't think you understand.

175
00:09:34,594 --> 00:09:36,996
She thinks she's...

176
00:09:36,997 --> 00:09:40,253
making love with him.

177
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:42,888
Tell me exactly what she said.

178
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:46,336
Did your father ever
give her spa treatments

179
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:49,606
that released
a "fire in her loins"?

180
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:52,396
Oh!

181
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:54,465
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

182
00:09:54,466 --> 00:09:57,769
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,203
I shouldn't have told you.

184
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:01,312
But I can't get the image
out of my head.

185
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:02,714
Stop it, please.

186
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:05,150
I don't even want to think
about her brushing her teeth.

187
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:08,285
<i>I thought I cut you two off.</i>

188
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:10,847
Ted.

189
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:14,432
I have never been less
afraid of flying in my life.

190
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,854
What?
What does he mean?

191
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:20,290
Nothing.

192
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,725
Well, I should get the check.

193
00:10:35,195 --> 00:10:37,897
Honey, who's that gonna be?

194
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:45,772
- Arnold.
- Is it too late?

195
00:10:45,773 --> 00:10:49,508
For what?
Come in.

196
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:52,144
Look, I would have
called, but Sylvia is...

197
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:56,882
Listen, about
this afternoon--

198
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:59,584
Oh, hello, Arnold.

199
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:02,287
I'm sorry about my kid
dropping in on you.

200
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:06,324
I didn't know
if I should tell you.

201
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:07,792
Well, he figured you would

202
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,494
and I don't want you
in the middle of this.

203
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:11,663
His mother's treating it
like he's dying.

204
00:11:11,664 --> 00:11:13,665
She doesn't want
anyone to know.

205
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:17,635
Do you want a drink?

206
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:21,306
Sit up here drinking while they're
down there slamming the doors?

207
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,075
Been meaning to knock
on your door anyway.

208
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,211
You know, catch a game
or something.

209
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:31,648
I get baseball tickets.
Mostly the Mets.

210
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,883
Well, then I'm glad you didn't.

211
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:40,856
You know, I didn't
even know he left school.

212
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:43,693
Sylvia says
she didn't know either.

213
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,929
She's doing that
a lot lately--

214
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,265
lying about little things.

215
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,668
Could tell something's
been wrong all year.

216
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:58,072
- Another Manhattan?
- Nah. No.

217
00:11:58,073 --> 00:12:01,309
Should have never
let him go to Paris.

218
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,911
He got there right in
the middle of the riots.

219
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:05,814
His French is excellent.

220
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,451
I think he got a lot of girls

221
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:12,285
as an expatriate revolutionary.

222
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:14,287
Could kill him right now.

223
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:16,923
There has to be a way.

224
00:12:16,924 --> 00:12:19,226
Oh, believe me,
everybody's an expert on it.

225
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,662
Sylvia's father was
suddenly Clarence Darrow.

226
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:25,632
It's thrilling to see a plumber
interpret international law.

227
00:12:25,633 --> 00:12:28,167
You're one of the top
surgeons in the country.

228
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:31,303
You must know somebody.

229
00:12:31,304 --> 00:12:33,205
I know a lot of people,
but it doesn't matter.

230
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:36,008
It doesn't matter
if he goes back to school.

231
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:39,044
He's 1-A. His induction
could be tomorrow.

232
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:41,280
He's on a damn list
for the rest of his life.

233
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,519
On some level you have
to admire his idealism.

234
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,987
You sound like Sylvia.

235
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:51,890
But she doesn't really
buy his bullshit.

236
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:53,191
You think she's gonna
let her baby

237
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,394
rot in jail for a cause?

238
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,930
I don't know what to do.

239
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,367
What would you do?

240
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,536
If it was my kid,
or if it was me?

241
00:13:05,537 --> 00:13:07,304
You were in the service, right?

242
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:08,506
I was.

243
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:10,408
You see action?

244
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,414
It was very different.

245
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:20,316
I wanted to go.

246
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,819
And then when
I got there, well...

247
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,921
That's the trick.

248
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:27,457
Kids 18, 19 years old, they have
no sense of their own mortality.

249
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,358
Or anyone else's.

250
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:31,093
That's why they make
good soldiers.

251
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:33,695
Well, the Army
paid for med school.

252
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:37,032
I served in a hospital
in Pusan.

253
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,367
We were very lucky.

254
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:40,836
Lucky enough to live
in this country.

255
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:43,639
And service is part
of that bargain.

256
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,841
Sacrifice.

257
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:48,476
We knew that.

258
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:50,711
The war is wrong.

259
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:53,915
I'll tell you right now, if
anyone was ever gonna get it,

260
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,883
it's gonna be him.

261
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:58,453
He's soft.

262
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,521
I'm sure he's a good kid.

263
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,591
The best.

264
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:18,438
What you watching?

265
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,573
I don't know.

266
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:25,578
What's the matter?
I called.

267
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,413
I didn't want to get into it
when you're about to fly,

268
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:30,148
but you were supposed
to have dinner with us.

269
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:32,217
I made a mistake.
We'll do it tomorrow.

270
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,252
You don't have to make
a federal case out of it.

271
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,753
Why don't you get a legal pad

272
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:38,022
and write down a bunch of
excuses for the next week?

273
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:39,891
Because none of them
mean anything to the boys.

274
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:43,695
What about food, clothing, and shelter?
Does that mean anything?

275
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,997
Remember what the minister
said at Frank's funeral?

276
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,666
"God can turn off
the lights at any moment."

277
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,768
You know where you're gonna be?
The office.

278
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:53,136
This is temporary.

279
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:55,539
I just have
to do this until--

280
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,907
Until what?

281
00:14:56,908 --> 00:14:59,810
Until you are back

282
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,512
where you were at the old firm?

283
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:03,814
Because things weren't
so great then either.

284
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:06,884
So we've moved on

285
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,684
from I'm working too much
to something else.

286
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:11,086
The problem is even
when you do come home,

287
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:13,523
you're not here.
You're obsessed.

288
00:15:13,524 --> 00:15:16,959
And I can feel how
disappointing this all is

289
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,394
compared to
your battles at work.

290
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:19,896
I'm not enjoying that.

291
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:22,097
How did we get to
the point where you think

292
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:25,066
I don't want you
to enjoy things?

293
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:28,637
I know you like having a young
copywriter in your airplane.

294
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:30,739
Come on, Pete was there, too.

295
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,941
I know you like
facing Don Draper

296
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:35,109
every morning
more than the clients.

297
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:43,250
How was your day?

298
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:46,520
I just wish you liked
being here more.

299
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:54,961
Could you get
Mr. Campbell?

300
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:56,696
Do you want to see him
before the status meeting?

301
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:59,132
- Ugh, when's that?
- Now.

302
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,201
And I also need to know if you're
attending the Chevrolet dinner.

303
00:16:01,202 --> 00:16:04,103
- When's that?
- Tonight.

304
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:06,505
- Morning.
- May I speak with you?

305
00:16:14,881 --> 00:16:16,682
Does your friend still work
at the Department of Defense?

306
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:18,516
No, he left for Union Carbide.

307
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,751
But he probably still
has pull over there.

308
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:22,954
What happened now?

309
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,726
You must know plenty of people
with kids getting deferments.

310
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:30,061
How are they doing that?

311
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:31,596
They go to college.

312
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:33,431
Divinity school.
Medical baloney.

313
00:16:33,432 --> 00:16:36,166
No, it's too late for that. I need
someone who can really pull strings.

314
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,035
Well, aren't you having
dinner with General Motors,

315
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:41,072
one of the largest defense
contractors in the world?

316
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:42,873
What are the politics of that?

317
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:45,275
I don't know, Don.
I'm not on Chevy.

318
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:48,212
<i>Shall we?</i>

319
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:50,147
That's not my fault.

320
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,683
Don't worry.
If I had Chevy

321
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:56,920
I wouldn't be able to devote my
full attention to Ocean Spray.

322
00:16:56,921 --> 00:17:00,123
- Cranberries?
- Cranberry cocktail.

323
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:02,358
And they like us so much they
might even give us the blends.

324
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,761
- What about Sunkist?
- What about it?

325
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,562
It's orange juice.

326
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:08,831
Morning, everyone.

327
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:11,233
- Did you know about Sunkist?
- What about it?

328
00:17:11,234 --> 00:17:13,669
Don told Harry to put together
a media plan right away.

329
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,604
Why didn't you
tell us about that?

330
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:18,140
Isn't this the meeting
where I tell you?

331
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:19,775
Are we having this meeting?

332
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:21,610
Why didn't you tell us you were
presenting to Ocean Spray?

333
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:23,077
There's been a series of memos.

334
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,079
Didn't you wonder
where everybody was?

335
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,282
- We can't present to both.
- Which one is bigger?

336
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:30,752
They're about the same.
Three million.

337
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:33,220
We've already spent
$5,000 on Ocean Spray.

338
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,789
What about our trip
to California?

339
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,590
Was it $5,000?

340
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:39,359
I have a lot of receipts.
I haven't figured it out yet.

341
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,929
Why don't you join this company
and read a memo once in a while?

342
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,038
Maybe they're not a conflict.

343
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,306
We don't have either yet.

344
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,441
I really didn't know.

345
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:04,517
I warned you
about the memos, Ted.

346
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:07,053
The more you send,
the less they get read.

347
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:10,823
Imagine if every time Ginger
Rogers jumped in the air,

348
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,992
Fred Astaire punched her
in the face.

349
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:16,027
Why are you taking
this to heart?

350
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,431
Because it's directed at me.
Can you not see that?

351
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:22,501
So what? You know we'll end
up with just one juice.

352
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:25,571
I don't want his juice.
I want my juice.

353
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,639
It's all your juice.

354
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,507
Tell <i>him</i> that.

355
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,282
Michigan's in the Big 10.

356
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,819
Ron Kutchinski just ran the
fastest half mile in the world.

357
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,653
He's going to the Olympics.

358
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,254
You're selling yourself short.

359
00:18:44,255 --> 00:18:46,223
I'm telling you, they would
be lucky to have you.

360
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:47,925
I got it.

361
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,532
Look at this. Got a couple
of high fashion models.

362
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,234
Aren't you a gentleman?

363
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:59,536
- Hey.
- Hello.

364
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,237
Youse two don't know
each other.

365
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:02,839
These are my two
favorite people.

366
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,941
Mitchell Rosen, 16A,
I'd like you to meet

367
00:19:04,942 --> 00:19:09,645
Sally Draper, 17B
and all points north.

368
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:13,382
I'm Julie.
I'm crashing at Sally's.

369
00:19:13,383 --> 00:19:15,084
Cool.

370
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:18,120
They were supposed to leave a key for me.
I lost mine.

371
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,956
Nobody said nothing to me,
but that don't mean nothing.

372
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:23,225
We were going to go out
for dinner tonight.

373
00:19:23,226 --> 00:19:25,560
- What's good around here?
- His mother's cooking.

374
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:29,664
Around here
it's just old people.

375
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:31,266
Are you a musician?

376
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:33,367
'Cause you look like one.

377
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:35,402
Who?

378
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:38,572
I don't see it.
I'll let you in.

379
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:40,074
Oh, good day to you,
Mrs. Rosen.

380
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:41,909
Hello. Mitchell,
did you get a cab?

381
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,411
- I was waiting for you.
- You're unbelievable.

382
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:46,580
I got it, Mrs. Rosen.
Do you know Sally and...?

383
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:49,783
- I'm Julie. - I'm sorry, girls,
we're in a bit of a rush.

384
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:52,118
I'll get you a cab
lickety-split.

385
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,287
Bring them right back.

386
00:19:58,425 --> 00:20:00,160
You're living
with Mark Lindsay.

387
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,470
I don't live here.

388
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,419
What are you doing here?

389
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,288
I said I'd meet you
at La Grenouille.

390
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:12,258
Dorothy, you must let me
manage your calendar.

391
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,092
I'm not standing
in the hallway.

392
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:15,861
Come in.

393
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:21,566
You get ready, Mr. Campbell.
I'll entertain her.

394
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:26,404
Actually, Manolo, I'd like my
mother to myself this evening.

395
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,474
Very well.
Good night, my sweet.

396
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:34,011
Must he?

397
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:36,247
He has other plans, Mother.

398
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:39,816
Yes, Dorothy. I'll be
there when you wake.

399
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,127
- Can I fix you something?
- No.

400
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:53,362
Manolo doesn't
like me to drink.

401
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:54,997
He likes me sharp.

402
00:20:58,568 --> 00:21:01,236
It's so nice the way
he looks after you.

403
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:04,740
Oh, Peter, he's a gift to me.

404
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,809
I just wanted to make
sure you're aware

405
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,344
he's your nurse.

406
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:11,112
You are prone to moments
of confusion.

407
00:21:11,113 --> 00:21:14,248
I suppose there's a way
I could mistake

408
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:17,218
your tone for concern.

409
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,987
I am concerned
that you have--

410
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:23,157
how do I put this?

411
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,327
--misconstrued Manolo's
attention for affection.

412
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,130
If we're going to have
an adult conversation,

413
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:31,699
let's have
an adult conversation.

414
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,533
Has he taken advantage of you?

415
00:21:33,534 --> 00:21:35,735
Manny has awakened a part of me

416
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:38,571
that was long dormant.

417
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:42,542
Don't you think I'm entitled
to the pleasures of love?

418
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:44,044
Do not be more specific.

419
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:46,713
Since when is it
any of your business

420
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:48,314
what goes on in my bedroom?

421
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:50,816
I am afraid that we are going
to have to let him go.

422
00:21:50,817 --> 00:21:53,618
Oh, no.
What did he do?

423
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,654
He's a pervert.

424
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,592
You were a sour little boy.

425
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:03,528
And you're a sour little man.

426
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:06,832
How could I expect you
to be understanding?

427
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,601
You've always been unlovable.

428
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,805
Now I've lost my appetite.

429
00:22:13,806 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm leaving.

430
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,875
You'll never find
your way home.

431
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,043
I have carfare

432
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:21,479
and a piece of paper
with my address

433
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,715
written in his
elegant handwriting.

434
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:28,753
Mother.

435
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:40,263
Cheesecake?
Chocolate cake?

436
00:22:40,264 --> 00:22:42,432
- Two of everything.
- And another round.

437
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:45,635
- Why not?
- Oh, I can never get enough of it.

438
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:47,970
Growing up in Cleveland, my dad
would take me right on Lake Erie.

439
00:22:47,971 --> 00:22:49,839
But, eh, water's gone bad now.

440
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,173
You should go to Florida.

441
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:53,341
Saltwater.
Down off the Keys

442
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:55,677
- where the marlin run.
- Write your own Hemmingway story.

443
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,479
And if you don't catch anything,
you have to blow your brains out.

444
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,785
So, Ross, where do you
take your kid fishing?

445
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:05,921
I just got the two girls, and they
could never keep their mouths shut.

446
00:23:05,922 --> 00:23:07,423
But my grandson's just like me.

447
00:23:07,424 --> 00:23:10,024
Last summer we went
up to Muskoka.

448
00:23:10,025 --> 00:23:11,559
Ontario.

449
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,359
Jesus, now we got to hear
about this kid again.

450
00:23:13,896 --> 00:23:15,530
Brendan's at Antioch.

451
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:17,665
Yup, studying the classics.

452
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,201
But I hope he'll come
to his senses.

453
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:25,539
He's got a couple of years
before he has decisions to make.

454
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,608
Well, as long as we're working
together, he's got a job with us.

455
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,947
Friend of mine's kid
just got to that point.

456
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:36,683
He doesn't have a lot of choices left.
1-A. Can you imagine?

457
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,855
Well, my heart goes out to him.

458
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,289
That's just one of those
problems that can't be solved.

459
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,860
I've got two sons.

460
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,361
Thank God they're too young.

461
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,931
I don't even like
to think about that.

462
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,365
I know.

463
00:23:53,366 --> 00:23:56,034
My friend is just
beside himself.

464
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,505
I mean, people are
doing things, though.

465
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,607
Believe me, we know about that.

466
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,476
Makes me sick.

467
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:14,585
Well, next year this time,
we'll have won the war.

468
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,820
We'll take Brendan to
dinner, get him plastered,

469
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,522
and have him read
the menu in Latin.

470
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,893
Ted, are you an angler?

471
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,161
My hobby is coming up
with names for the XP.

472
00:24:34,068 --> 00:24:37,134
_

473
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,008
Last one.

474
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:49,417
Okay.

475
00:24:49,418 --> 00:24:51,753
"Things I like
about Mitchell."

476
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,692
"His ass"?

477
00:24:57,693 --> 00:24:59,895
- Shh.
- When did you see that?

478
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:02,262
I couldn't think
of anything else.

479
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:04,331
What did you put?

480
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:08,502
"How he smiled at me."

481
00:25:08,503 --> 00:25:10,337
"His shoulders."

482
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,541
"His red shirt."

483
00:25:16,444 --> 00:25:18,578
You girls have
a big day tomorrow

484
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:21,714
and I can tell you right now, the next
time this door opens, it won't be me.

485
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:25,084
- Lights out.
- Good night, Mrs. Draper.

486
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:30,256
Why do you keep
calling her that?

487
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:32,758
'Cause she hates it.

488
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:34,259
Think about it.

489
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,895
He's right down there.

490
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,199
You should sneak down
and kiss him.

491
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,368
He talked to you.

492
00:25:45,939 --> 00:25:48,239
God, I wish I lived here.

493
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,737
- Yeah?
- Did I wake you?

494
00:26:21,738 --> 00:26:24,673
- Yeah.
- There's a rat in my apartment.

495
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:27,910
Told you to get traps.

496
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:30,079
It's in the trap
and it's mortally wounded.

497
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,114
I'm pretty sure
'cause there's a lot of blood.

498
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:33,682
Did you call an ambulance?

499
00:26:33,683 --> 00:26:36,051
You have to come over.
It went under the couch.

500
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,019
I can't even look.
What if it's still alive?

501
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,955
What if I lift the couch
and it starts flipping around?

502
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:44,058
I'm not your boyfriend.

503
00:26:46,394 --> 00:26:48,630
Maybe I'll make it worth
your while if you come over.

504
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:51,432
No, you won't.
Now good night.

505
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:53,133
You're not interested?

506
00:26:53,134 --> 00:26:54,868
No.

507
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:56,737
Then why are you using
your sexy voice?

508
00:26:58,205 --> 00:27:00,107
Tuesday morning's great.

509
00:27:00,108 --> 00:27:01,541
For what?

510
00:27:01,542 --> 00:27:03,977
Oh.

511
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:05,345
Why didn't you say so?

512
00:27:05,346 --> 00:27:08,048
You can bring her.

513
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:10,349
It'll be dead by morning.

514
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:23,353
Eleanor Roosevelt.

515
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:26,289
I can't remember anything
'cause I didn't sleep.

516
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,124
Your floor smells like pee.

517
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,760
- No, it doesn't.
- Do I smell like pee?

518
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,294
You smell like Prell.

519
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:33,863
Sally, you're not ready?

520
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:35,564
I let the guest shower first.

521
00:27:35,565 --> 00:27:37,533
Well, I have to go to work.

522
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:39,669
But first I have to put you
two in a cab, so shake a leg.

523
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,537
Oh, take out the trash.

524
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:43,438
I have to get ready.

525
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:46,507
I'll do it, Mrs. Draper.

526
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:48,242
It's Megan.

527
00:27:48,243 --> 00:27:50,812
I would love to visit
the studio sometime.

528
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:53,048
Well, hopefully
I'll still have a job.

529
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:54,983
I have to make a phone call.

530
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:57,585
- Your agent?
- Yes, actually.

531
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:10,898
Could you get me some coffee?

532
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:18,370
What the hell were you
up to last night?

533
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:20,239
<i>Mr. Draper.</i>

534
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,142
I'm fine, Dawn.
You want some coffee?

535
00:28:23,143 --> 00:28:24,944
What the hell
were you thinking?

536
00:28:24,945 --> 00:28:28,114
You said you weren't going to be
involved in Chevy until 1970.

537
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:30,016
So stay the hell out of it.

538
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:31,817
Stop trying to poison
my relationship.

539
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:34,052
Last time I checked,
it's <i>our</i> relationship.

540
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:35,887
And not everything
is about you, Ted.

541
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,756
Then be better at it.

542
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,991
- What are you talking about?
- You know this.

543
00:28:39,992 --> 00:28:43,461
A client shouldn't have a single
negative feeling in your presence.

544
00:28:43,462 --> 00:28:45,731
Not the food, not the wine,

545
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:47,765
and certainly not the war.

546
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:48,933
I was just taking
their temperature.

547
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:51,168
Why would you do that?

548
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:52,703
It's Chevy, Don.

549
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:55,672
- You'd do it for your kid.
- But it's not your kid.

550
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:58,008
Oh, is it your kid?

551
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,344
No, it's my friend's kid.

552
00:29:08,753 --> 00:29:10,386
Well, I bet you don't have
a lot of friends, Don,

553
00:29:10,387 --> 00:29:12,288
so I'm going to assume
this is important.

554
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,124
It is.

555
00:29:16,026 --> 00:29:19,095
I just--
I don't know what to do.

556
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:21,096
Do you know how young 19 is?

557
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:22,998
Did you ever think
about talking to me

558
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,432
instead of our most
important client?

559
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:26,101
I don't know.
It's GM.

560
00:29:26,102 --> 00:29:28,804
Who else has that kind
of clout in Washington?

561
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:30,505
Does he wear glasses?

562
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:32,841
I don't think so, but he could.

563
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:37,578
The guy who taught me to fly

564
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:40,581
is a brigadier general
in the Air National Guard.

565
00:29:40,582 --> 00:29:42,483
They're always looking
for exceptional young men

566
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:44,819
to become pilots.

567
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:48,555
And you'd be willing
to call him?

568
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:50,758
I'd consider it.

569
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,660
But first, you're going
to have to stop the war.

570
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,428
I can't stop the war, Ted.

571
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:56,763
Don't be an asshole, Don.

572
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:58,464
The war you're waging on me.

573
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,133
You have to lower your weapons.

574
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:01,902
What are you talking about?

575
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:04,805
I'm talking about how we
are going to get Ocean Spray.

576
00:30:04,806 --> 00:30:07,640
So you need to stop
chasing Sunkist.

577
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:10,242
You're not going to compete
with me like that anymore.

578
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:12,477
We're on the same damn side.

579
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:16,248
- That's it?
- Don't act like it's nothing.

580
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:18,483
It seems to be
impossible so far.

581
00:30:21,054 --> 00:30:23,755
You'd really do that?

582
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,432
Thank you.

583
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,000
This is not
a handshake of gratitude.

584
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,569
- This is a binding contract.
- Of course.

585
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,771
- Whatever you want.
- That's what I want.

586
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,044
Hold on.
What's the next step?

587
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,279
Tell the kid to write a letter

588
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,681
about his childhood
dream of being a pilot.

589
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,084
And it better be convincing.
You should write it.

590
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,785
And tell him to get a haircut.

591
00:30:56,786 --> 00:31:00,857
Be straight, Ted.
What are the chances?

592
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,825
I'm going to call right now.

593
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:04,526
Thank you.

594
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:12,334
Can you get Dr. Rosen
on the phone?

595
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:23,378
- Rosen residence.
- It's me. It's Don.

596
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:24,913
What do you want?

597
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:26,748
I'm trying to reach Arnold.

598
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:29,449
<i>The office said</i>
<i>he was home sick.</i>

599
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,285
It's about Mitchell.

600
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:33,053
What? Tell me.

601
00:31:33,054 --> 00:31:35,923
I know someone who knows someone
in the Air National Guard.

602
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:38,359
He's getting him a spot.

603
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,160
You told someone?

604
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,661
It's my partner.

605
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:43,864
He's doing me a favor.

606
00:31:48,735 --> 00:31:51,670
Did you fix it?

607
00:31:51,671 --> 00:31:53,172
He just wants Mitchell
to cut his hair

608
00:31:53,173 --> 00:31:55,808
and sign a letter.

609
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:58,311
And the two of you need to
make sure he follows through.

610
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:00,178
Oh, he'll follow through.

611
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:03,448
I bet.

612
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:10,255
My God, is it possible?

613
00:32:10,256 --> 00:32:12,991
I think so,
but we have to act fast.

614
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:16,161
They went upstate to the VA
to call on an army buddy.

615
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:18,596
I'll send them up tonight.

616
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:20,698
Sylvia, sweetheart,
it's gonna be okay.

617
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:32,243
Are you there?

618
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:34,110
Yes.

619
00:32:34,111 --> 00:32:36,647
Please, stop crying.

620
00:32:36,648 --> 00:32:38,982
I feel better,

621
00:32:38,983 --> 00:32:41,284
but I'll feel better
when I know it's done.

622
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,991
Don...

623
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:50,092
Yes?

624
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,629
I can't believe you
would do this for me.

625
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,466
You know I have children, too.

626
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:59,435
I know that's not
why you're doing it.

627
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:04,739
And I hope--

628
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,943
well, I hope you know that I
was just frustrated with you.

629
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:12,981
I do now.

630
00:33:15,117 --> 00:33:18,453
I didn't want you
to fall in love.

631
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,855
You didn't feel anything?

632
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:29,329
No, I just...

633
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:34,267
I don't want
to go through this again.

634
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:39,639
You were good to me.

635
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:44,176
Better than I was to you.

636
00:33:51,218 --> 00:33:53,584
- Are we going to lunch, because--
- Get in here and close the door.

637
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:58,123
You have given me
a terrible problem

638
00:33:58,124 --> 00:33:59,390
and now you're going to fix it.

639
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:01,893
Is this about Sunkist?
Because I did some digging--

640
00:34:01,894 --> 00:34:05,230
I told you we needed a nurse
and you sent us a rapist.

641
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:06,564
Manolo?

642
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:08,066
In fact, I never
told you anything.

643
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:09,666
You were just
"doing some digging."

644
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:12,069
Calm down.
Sit down.

645
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,241
Bob...

646
00:34:17,242 --> 00:34:19,910
she has the mind of a child.

647
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:21,778
That man took advantage of her.

648
00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:25,081
I assume she told
you this story.

649
00:34:25,082 --> 00:34:27,150
Don't you have
your answer right there?

650
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:28,885
She says they're in love

651
00:34:28,886 --> 00:34:31,321
and it's the first time in months
she's seemed sure of anything.

652
00:34:31,322 --> 00:34:35,624
I don't think that Manolo's
interests turn that way.

653
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,061
Great, so he's a degenerate.

654
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:40,196
That means he's capable
of anything.

655
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:47,169
What exactly did she say?

656
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,905
Please, I'm just
trying to forget it.

657
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:52,007
Drink that.

658
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:02,950
- Feel better now?
- I do.

659
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:04,518
Can I ask you something?

660
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:07,454
Did she seem happy?

661
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,624
Yes.

662
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:12,459
She did.

663
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:21,968
Is it really
so impossible to imagine?

664
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:25,105
What?

665
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:26,739
Couldn't it be that

666
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,142
if someone took care of you,

667
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:32,711
very good care of you...

668
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:37,283
if this person would do
anything for you,

669
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:41,020
if your well-being
was his only thought...

670
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:45,456
is it impossible that you might

671
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:48,092
begin to feel something
for him?

672
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:53,664
When there's true love,

673
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:56,234
it doesn't matter who it is.

674
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:15,618
Tell him I'll give him
a month's pay.

675
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:18,787
And tell him it's disgusting.

676
00:36:22,892 --> 00:36:25,061
Of course.

677
00:36:35,504 --> 00:36:37,839
The capital of the
Philippines is Manila.

678
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,808
Its president
is Ferdinand Marcos.

679
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:43,044
Its national language
is Tagalog,

680
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:45,646
but many of its
inhabitants speak Spanish

681
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:47,715
due to its colonial past.

682
00:36:47,716 --> 00:36:50,684
And their national
product is...?

683
00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:53,954
I don't know.
Manila envelopes?

684
00:36:53,955 --> 00:36:57,357
- You don't know anything.
- So?

685
00:36:57,358 --> 00:36:59,593
How about this? All the boys are
going to think you're dumb.

686
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:01,628
Don't tell me how to get boys.

687
00:37:01,629 --> 00:37:03,697
You went to second base twice.

688
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:06,666
That's a lot more than you.

689
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,869
So if I were you,
I'd be scared.

690
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,471
- Of what?
- Of what you're going to do

691
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:13,572
when Mitchell asks you
to go all the way.

692
00:37:13,573 --> 00:37:15,541
He doesn't even know I'm alive.

693
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:18,677
Oh, I took care of that.

694
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:20,412
What did you do?

695
00:37:20,413 --> 00:37:21,914
I introduced you.

696
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:23,549
I introduced myself.

697
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,119
No, I took the letter
and I signed your name.

698
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,087
- What?!
- And I slid it under the back door.

699
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:32,690
Ow! That really hurts.

700
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:34,592
How could you do that?
Now I can never go back.

701
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:36,661
You know you're going
to thank me.

702
00:37:43,923 --> 00:37:45,122
Just because your shift is over

703
00:37:45,123 --> 00:37:47,058
doesn't mean you can get
undressed in the lobby.

704
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,087
- Incredible.
- What?

705
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:56,957
He should greet you.
How you doing today?

706
00:37:56,958 --> 00:38:00,994
I'm-- I got--
I left something.

707
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:02,730
And I don't have my key.

708
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:04,865
You mean you lost it already?

709
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,066
Can I have the keys, please?

710
00:38:09,903 --> 00:38:12,304
Yeah. Okay.

711
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:15,675
<i>Go fast.</i>

712
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:20,980
Oh, what have we got here?

713
00:38:20,981 --> 00:38:22,848
<i>Couple of high fashion models?</i>

714
00:38:55,413 --> 00:38:57,447
Oh, God.

715
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,624
- Sally.
- Oh, God.

716
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,760
Oh, dear God.

717
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:15,264
Dear God, what have we done?

718
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,707
Sally!

719
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:31,413
Sally!

720
00:39:31,414 --> 00:39:33,381
Sally!

721
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,442
Did Sally just come
through here?

722
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:04,210
Mr. Draper, I didn't
know you was home.

723
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:05,879
She hopped in a cab just now.
I'll go get her.

724
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:10,951
You okay?

725
00:40:10,952 --> 00:40:12,519
Yes.

726
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,554
Did something happen?

727
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:17,490
I know she lost her keys. I gave
her the keys. It's my fault.

728
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:33,972
Mr. Draper?

729
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:18,536
<i>Hello?</i>

730
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:33,985
Oh, I'm glad you're home.

731
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:39,520
Let me get you a plate.

732
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:41,355
Oh, wow.

733
00:42:41,356 --> 00:42:43,290
I had a client...

734
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,292
meeting-- lunch.

735
00:42:45,293 --> 00:42:47,661
- Sit down.
- I'm--

736
00:42:47,662 --> 00:42:49,530
I'm gonna lay down.

737
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:51,799
You need to get some food in you.
Sit down.

738
00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:56,268
Do you want me
to cut you a piece?

739
00:42:58,806 --> 00:43:01,007
No.

740
00:43:01,008 --> 00:43:02,774
I got it.

741
00:43:05,412 --> 00:43:07,513
<i>Hello.</i>

742
00:43:07,514 --> 00:43:09,648
I'm sorry to bother you.

743
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:11,984
Don, Arnold and
Mitchell <i>are here.</i>

744
00:43:13,586 --> 00:43:15,488
- I don't feel well.
- Stop.

745
00:43:19,258 --> 00:43:20,791
Hello, Mitchell.

746
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:22,660
I'm sorry
to interrupt your dinner,

747
00:43:22,661 --> 00:43:24,962
but we just got back and Mitchell
has something he wants to say.

748
00:43:28,634 --> 00:43:30,768
Mr. Draper...

749
00:43:33,172 --> 00:43:35,806
thank you very much.

750
00:43:36,942 --> 00:43:38,709
We'll see if it works.

751
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,211
- What?
- He didn't tell you?

752
00:43:42,614 --> 00:43:44,749
Don talked to somebody for us.

753
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,083
Really?

754
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:48,653
Sylvia sends her gratitude.
She is overwhelmed.

755
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:53,356
Do you want something to eat?
We should celebrate.

756
00:43:53,357 --> 00:43:55,391
One step at a time.

757
00:43:55,392 --> 00:43:58,595
Anyway, Don,

758
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:00,430
I owe you.

759
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:06,102
Let's go.

760
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:07,703
No, you eat. I got it.

761
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:13,709
You are the sweetest man.

762
00:44:15,511 --> 00:44:17,446
You make me sick!

763
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:20,916
Sally, come back here!

764
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:23,017
What happened?

765
00:44:23,018 --> 00:44:24,786
I don't know.

766
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:25,987
I'm gonna go talk to her.

767
00:44:25,988 --> 00:44:27,622
No.
I'll talk to her.

768
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,961
She has a crush on Mitchell.

769
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,229
Oh.

770
00:44:40,668 --> 00:44:42,636
Sally.

771
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,409
- Open the door.
- <i>No.</i>

772
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,544
You don't get
to talk to me anymore.

773
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,815
Sally?

774
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,120
Sally, open the door.
I need to talk to you.

775
00:45:20,806 --> 00:45:23,008
I know you think
you saw something.

776
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:30,080
I was... comforting
Mrs. Rosen.

777
00:45:33,218 --> 00:45:35,753
She was very upset.

778
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,225
It's very...

779
00:45:43,128 --> 00:45:45,762
complicated.

780
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,101
Sally, can you hear me?

781
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:54,971
Yes.

782
00:45:54,972 --> 00:45:57,440
Did you hear what I said?

783
00:46:00,544 --> 00:46:02,444
Okay.

784
00:46:41,451 --> 00:46:45,942
