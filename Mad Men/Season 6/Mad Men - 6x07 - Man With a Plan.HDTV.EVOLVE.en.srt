I'm a head of accounts, damn it!

6
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,135
What's gotten into you?

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,896
You're supposed to be
calming me down.

8
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,321
- Ted, I've got cancer.
- What?

9
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:15,592
You gotta call Ted.

<i>They wanted our ideas
and a big agency,</i>

11
00:00:19,465 --> 00:00:20,827
so we gave them both.

12
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:22,328
We merged.

13
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:25,772
We have to be careful.

14
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,640
We can't fall in love.

First day of school.
You nervous?

31
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:12,428
What do you think?

32
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:14,796
It seems silly to ask, but do
you know where you're going?

33
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:17,099
I'll just follow you.

34
00:02:17,134 --> 00:02:20,435
- Hello, everyone.
- Hey!

35
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:23,004
Stan, Ginsberg, Ted Chaough.

36
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:27,042
This is Margie. Margie, Peggy.
Margie, Ted.

37
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:28,809
It's nice to put
faces with names.

38
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,578
I saw you taking your
little tour the other week

39
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:31,913
and you looked pretty tall.

40
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:33,614
But now I see
you're about my height.

41
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:36,150
I hope you can still
look up to me.

42
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:39,219
- That was quick.
- Pleasure, Margie.

43
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,621
I've heard a lot about you.
We're all very excited.

44
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:46,527
Nice knowing you.

You're in the second office
from reception.

47
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:59,738
Your secretary will be Connie.

48
00:02:59,773 --> 00:03:03,809
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

49
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,545
Excuse me, Joan.

50
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,679
Are all the creatives
in one office?

51
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:11,483
- It's temporary.
- Well, it's going to be very crowded.

52
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:14,252
But that may change soon.

53
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:17,689
I know where all
the bodies are buried.

54
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:20,559
- I need a copy of that.
- They're just notes.

55
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:22,259
I need a copy
for Mr. Chaough.

56
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:23,994
He's not going
to change anything,

57
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:25,596
but he's going to be angry
if I don't know what it is.

58
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,231
Good morning, Moira.

59
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:30,033
- Joan.
- Good morning.

60
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:32,936
- Well, hello there.
- Hello.

61
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:34,805
I'm sorry they didn't
have your office ready yet.

62
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,207
I'll make do.

63
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,708
You know what, Moira?

64
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:39,509
I'll take care of Miss Olson.

65
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:41,578
Hopefully you can read
my handwriting.

66
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:45,381
We're putting you
in Harry's old office.

67
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,917
- Oh.
- But you don't have to share it.

68
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,685
As long as I don't
have to share Phyllis.

69
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,721
Are you okay?

70
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,889
I don't know.

71
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:56,925
It could be moving boxes
or it could be I slept funny.

72
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,028
Are you still in there?

73
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:02,464
Yes, everything keeps
changing out here,

74
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,666
but everything's
the same in there.

75
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,101
Except you're a partner.

76

He's the man in my life.

00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,579
- How's yours?
- Oh, he's good.

80
00:04:18,614 --> 00:04:20,414
We bought a building
together to live in.

to read to our employees,

94

but perhaps it's best to wait

Don took the last one.

Yes, thank you.

Moira, take my chair.

Now that we've dispensed
with the gallantry,

Jim Cutler and I have,

They want to be Ted

That's new business.

Isn't there a section of this
meeting called good news?

114
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:27,767
I never would have taken you
for such a stickler.

115
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,603
Fleischmann's? Groovy.
We'll get right on it.

116

But that's only because
we invited ourselves.

The New York State Thruway.

126
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:55,493
I just got off the phone

127
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:56,860
with Henry Lammott
at Mohawk Airlines--

128
00:06:56,895 --> 00:06:58,262
Mohawk's on the next page.

129
00:06:58,297 --> 00:07:00,230
This is related to the Thruway.

130
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:02,266
Henry Lammott
considers it a conflict,

131
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,635
<i>car travel and air travel</i>
<i>being mortal enemies.</i>

132

So when Burt Peterson gets ahold
of them, we should resign.

133
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:09,105
Did you tell Lammott
that was a stretch?

134
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,808
It's a $250,000 media budget.

135
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:13,343
Mohawk is an airline.

136
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:16,279
Except, Ted, the client
is New York State

137
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:18,214
and they gave us
their media buy up front.

138
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:20,650
- And you already spent it.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

139
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:24,486
Why didn't you tell us you lost Vicks
for yourself and Clearasil for us?

140
00:07:24,521 --> 00:07:26,622
Why didn't you tell us
Frank Gleason was dying?

141
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,390
Frank's going to be fine.

142
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,659
I know Henry Lammott.

143
00:07:30,694 --> 00:07:32,761
Pete and I will fly up there.

144
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:34,095
And Ted.

145
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,597
Of course.

146
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,065
What kind of plane do you have?

147
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:39,200
A Mohawk plane.

148
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:40,802
Ted's a pilot.

149
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:45,740
I'll take us up there.

150
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:47,742
We can land
right outside his office.

151
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:53,614
- Even better.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

152
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:55,449
Mr. Campbell, there's an
urgent phone call for you.

153
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:58,952
However we're going,

154
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:01,521
I recommend we go up tomorrow.

155
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:08,428
What's the next client?

156
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:11,263
Um, Koss Headphones.

157
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,733
<i>Burt Peterson and Ken Cosgrove.</i>

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,274
Mr. Campbell,
I didn't want to trouble you,

161
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,309
but she was--

162
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:26,845
she's right here.
You want to talk to her?

163
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,346
What happened exactly?

164
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:30,648
Well, she was banging
on the door pretty hard,

165
00:08:30,683 --> 00:08:32,283
saying she needed
to see your father.

166
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:34,352
<i>I thought somebody</i>
<i>was gonna call a cop.</i>

167
00:08:34,387 --> 00:08:35,787
May I speak with her?

168
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:40,258
Bill, you've been so decent,
I hate to ask you another favor,

169
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:42,593
but could you get her
a G and T with two ice cubes?

170
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:45,195
- Gin and tonic?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

171
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:49,266
I don't know what's going on,

172
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,369
but I found this address
on my nightstand

173
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:54,438
in some woman's handwriting

174
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,073
and I assumed your father
was up to his old tricks.

175
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:59,275
Mother, he passed away.

176
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:01,411
You'd like that.
No.

177
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:03,513
He hasn't been home
for over a week

178
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:06,048
and his golf clubs
are still at the house.

179
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:09,118
Mother, you sound confused.

180
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:10,653
What are you implying?

181
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:12,655
I want you to relax,
watch the television,

182
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:14,356
and I will call Bud
to come and get you.

183
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:16,825
He's going to send
that girl Trudy.

184
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:19,027
Bud's wife is Judy, not Trudy.

185
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:22,196
Now I suppose I'm crazy
for mixing those up.

186
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,899
Tell Billy you're fine
on your own.

187
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,467
I am.

188
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,581
Hello there.

189
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,983
Nice to see you, Peggy.

190
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,485
Burt.

191
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,820
We're a long way
from Sterling Cooper.

192
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:49,288
Looks like the worm has turned.

193
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:52,625
Well, it's nice to have
the old team back together.

194
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,361
Do you want me to get that?

195
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,232
Hello.

196
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,302
Oh, I was expecting
a secretary.

197
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,104
There isn't one
on the line, is there?

198
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,306
Hold on.

199
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:10,542
I've got to take this.

200
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,310
Well, we'll have plenty
of time to catch up

201
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,878
on those flights to Detroit.

202
00:10:18,917 --> 00:10:21,586
He's still a cold fish.

203
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,690
Hello.

204
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,193
Come over here now.

205
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,094
I can't.

206
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:32,463
I have too much
going on in the office.

207
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,231
I need you

208
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:36,534
and nothing else will do.

209
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:42,006
Oh.

210
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:46,142
So?

211
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:51,114
12:30 at
the Sherry-Netherland.

212
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:53,483
Call me with a room number.

213
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:01,056
Come on in, Burt.

214
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,192
Have a seat.

215
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:07,062
What is this, a bed?

216
00:11:07,096 --> 00:11:08,964
Yeah, you might want
to lie down

217
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:11,099
because here we are again.

218
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:14,570
Well, I haven't
forgotten anything.

219
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:16,572
Not a damn thing.

220
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:18,840
A lot of times in life
you get to do something

221
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:20,509
and you don't realize
until it's over

222
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:22,244
how much you enjoyed it.

223
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,212
And you swear that the
next time it comes around,

224
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,081
you're gonna remember that.

225
00:11:26,115 --> 00:11:27,549
You're right.

226
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,217
And I think I can
work with you, too.

227
00:11:29,252 --> 00:11:31,153
Work?

228
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:33,754
No, Burt, I'm letting
you go again.

229
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:36,823
What the hell?
You-- you can't do that.

230
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:40,694
Probably doesn't make a difference at
this point, but no one fought for you.

231
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:44,265
Well, we'll see what the folks
at Chevy have to say about this.

232
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,100
Remember Ken Cosgrove?

233
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:48,969
Like a six-foot version
of Alan Ladd?

234
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:50,970
He's touring
the plant right now.

235
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,373
You bastard.

236
00:11:53,407 --> 00:11:55,442
I've got four million
in billings.

237
00:11:55,476 --> 00:11:57,877
- What have you got?
- I was thinking you would feel that way.

238
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,813
That you had more clients
and that gives you a voice.

239
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:04,250
I was imagining you talking
over me in meetings.

240
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:06,351
Now I don't have that problem.

241
00:12:06,386 --> 00:12:08,387
My clients will leave with me.

242
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:11,290
No one will ever
say you weren't funny, Burt.

243
00:12:11,324 --> 00:12:13,058
Well, I'll tell you one thing,

244
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,859
I'm expecting some kind
of severance.

245
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,828
Who knows?
We're really hurting.

246
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:18,997
We're having to cut back.
Well, obviously.

247
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,799
God, you're a real prick,
you know that?

248
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,167
Damn it, Burt,
you stole my good-bye.

249
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:34,645
Oh, hello.
You must be Burt Peterson.

250
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,414
I'm Bob Benson.
I'm supposed to report to you.

251
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:39,316
Well, as a first order
of business,

252
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,451
I recommend that you stick
your head between your legs

253
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:43,086
and kiss your ass good-bye.

254
00:13:22,258 --> 00:13:23,891
What did you say to me?

255
00:13:25,127 --> 00:13:27,227
Come see me.

256
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:28,862
No.

257
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:32,666
I need you

258
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,834
and nothing else will do.

259
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:49,882
You worked on the Daisy?

260
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,252
No, I worked on the KKK spot.

261
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:55,120
You probably heard about it.
It was too hot to run.

262
00:13:55,155 --> 00:13:57,056
- That's very impressive.
- Thank you.

263
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,257
I mean, you made it 15 minutes
before you brought it up.

264
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:02,427
I just spoke with Dawn.

265
00:14:02,461 --> 00:14:04,196
Black or white?

266
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,030
She wouldn't tell me anything.

267
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:07,832
She's an excellent secretary.

268
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,134
I'm sure he can catch up.

269
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:14,004
So, before we inundate ourselves
with Fleischmann's unique benefits

270
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:16,973
and previous work,
I want to, I don't know,

271
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,443
have a little rap session
about margarine in general.

272
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:23,347
You mean like in terms
of the prospect?

273
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:25,416
Just whatever's on your mind.
Free-associate.

274
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:29,919
My grandmother.

275
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,554
Yeah.

276
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,155
Yellow.

277
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,591
Yes.

278
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,991
Greasy.

279
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:37,427
It's not butter.
It's cheap.

280
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,794
It has no smell.

281
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,463
Yeah, man.
Keep going.

282
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:41,864
People hate it.

283
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:43,399
Hold on a second.
Who hates margarine?

284
00:14:43,434 --> 00:14:44,967
You said there were
no wrong answers.

285
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,469
- I didn't say that.
- I don't hate it.

286
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,707
It was invented
for Napoleon III

287
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,909
because armies need to move
and it never spoiled.

288
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:56,645
That's fantastic.

289
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,979
How did you know that?

290
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:00,482
I don't know, I just did.

291
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,250
Let's get down
10 uses for margarine.

292
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:04,093
French army is number one.

293
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:07,221
And of course I was upset

294
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,390
because I was waiting
for Mitchell to call.

295
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:11,759
Then Arnie tells me
to cut the apron strings.

296
00:15:11,793 --> 00:15:13,327
All of France is on fire.

297
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,296
I don't even know
if the phones are working.

298
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,597
There's no room for me to worry
about anyone but Arnold,

299
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:19,098
not even our son.

300
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:22,469
You can talk about your kid,

301
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:24,337
but I don't want to hear
about your husband.

302
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:26,072
I can talk about
whatever I want.

303
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:28,508
Can you help me look
for my shoes while you do it?

304
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,677
You want me to look
for your shoes?

305
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:37,316
I want you to crawl on your hands
and knees until you find them.

306
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,520
They're right over there.

307
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:44,456
Do it.

308
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:18,021
I want you to get undressed,

309
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:19,956
then get back into bed.

310
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:50,852
Come over here.

311
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,996
Don't go anywhere.

312
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,127
I'm hearing a lot about bread.

313
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,864
It spreads easy
because it's soft.

314
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,600
Really melts into the--

315
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:34,903
What did he just say?

316
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:37,006
Don.
There you are.

317
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,375
Sorry about that.
I got held up.

318
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,121
Let's not push too hard today.

319
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,489
- What'd I miss?
- We got some good ideas,

320
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,558
and I think we're ready for
a more traditional approach--

321
00:17:57,592 --> 00:18:01,062
research, et cetera--
later in the week.

322
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,797
Great.
Peggy, you set the meeting.

323
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:15,108
What was that?

324
00:18:15,143 --> 00:18:17,010
What? You called
the meeting to a close.

325
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:18,578
You also had it without me.

326
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:20,680
If the meeting's at 1:00,
the meeting's at 1:00.

327
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,682
Don, five minutes,
10 minutes--

328
00:18:22,716 --> 00:18:24,651
I've been working in creative
my whole life, it's fine.

329
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:26,419
40 minutes?
Come on.

330
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,020
I've got better things to do,

331
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:30,423
but obviously you did, too.

332
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:56,880
Hello.

333
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:58,716
Are you still in bed?

334
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,618
Are you on your way?

335
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:05,422
You're going to wait there

336
00:19:05,456 --> 00:19:07,857
and you're not going to know
when I'm coming back.

337
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,827
What's gotten into you?

338
00:19:12,162 --> 00:19:14,063
Don't answer the phone again.

339
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:04,778
- Yes?
<i>- Mr. Draper is here to see you.</i>

340
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,747
Send him in.

341
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,353
- Am I bothering you?
- What is that?

342
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:16,689
An olive branch.

343
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,894
I was just thinking
that it's probably best

344
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:24,029
if we talk about
margarine by ourselves.

345
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:34,472
Sorry, I don't know
what you drink.

346
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:35,973
Whatever there is.

347
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:38,310
Of course, everything
is packed away.

348
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,412
I would have opened that first.

349
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:41,945
Might have clients coming in.

350
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,180
I have something better
for the clients.

351
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:44,515
I have this bar cart
wheeled in.

352
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,783
How is that better?

353
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:47,384
You should see the girl
who wheels it in.

354
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,019
It's quite a presentation.

355
00:20:49,053 --> 00:20:51,021
If you don't want to drink,
you don't have to drink.

356
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:04,300
So, you want to show me
your notes from the meeting?

357
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:07,704
It took 40 minutes to figure out
no one knows shit about margarine.

358
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:11,040
May I?

359
00:21:11,074 --> 00:21:12,875
Is this gonna be Detroit again?

360
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,509
You're gonna lie down
on the couch while I pace?

361
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:17,045
I'll lie down after
we have our next one.

362
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,648
Let's get something
on paper first.

363
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,357
- Where is she?
- Well, she spent 25 minutes

364
00:21:29,391 --> 00:21:32,292
looking for a dish for the nuts and
then she went into the bathroom.

365
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:34,462
- Good luck.
- Where are you going?

366
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:36,797
She's using the ladies' room.
She's been doing it for years.

367
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:39,199
- No, take her home.
- My home?

368
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:41,869
- That's not an option.
- That is the only option.

369
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,504
Do you have any idea
what's going on in my office?

370
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:45,005
We're in the middle
of a merger,

371
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,406
in case you didn't get
past the sports section.

372
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,575
I'm supposed to suddenly
care after you went

373
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,610
to White Weld to underwrite
your public offering?

374
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:52,579
I caught a shovelful
for that, Pete.

375
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,882
I got to pretend to my partners
that you don't believe in nepotism.

376
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,017
I apologize that you didn't
get on that sinking ship.

377
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:58,852
You just ride out this merger,

378
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:01,521
and in six months
I'm your first call.

379
00:22:01,555 --> 00:22:04,023
You don't understand. I went
to a meeting this morning

380
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:07,226
- and there was no chair for me.
- You're as high-strung as her.

381
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:09,896
First you don't have a chair,
then you don't have any clients.

382
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,598
- Mother, it's time to go.
- Don't do that yet.

383
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,333
Just get
your thoughts together.

384
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:16,635
- You have a long drive home.
- She has an apartment.

385
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,937
Even the cleaning woman quit.

386
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:22,007
Mother's cut all ties. The whole
place smells like a rabbit warren.

387
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,309
Judy and I have taken our turn.
Now it's yours.

388
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,511
No, that is not going to work.

389
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,447
Judy is finished with her.

390
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,418
They got in a dispute about
Earl Grey or Major Grey

391
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,320
and Mother snapped her with a
tea towel across the face.

392
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,789
She should be locked up.

393
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,157
Maybe we can get
the paperwork started.

394
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,260
In the meantime,
buy Trudy a catcher's mask

395
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,763
and be happy that you get
to go to work every day.

396
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:56,306
I know why he's late
for everything.

397
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,408
Because we've put up with it.

398
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:02,245
I mean, honestly, is Peter
any busier than you are?

399
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,580
Mother, I'm Peter.

400
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:05,549
Do you want to go
to the Colony?

401
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,182
That's a splendid idea.

402
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,151
No, I have some soup.

403
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:11,887
Just take me home.

404
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:14,222
You're spending the night here.
You can have the bed.

405
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:15,991
I never sleep.

406
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:18,494
And you should be well rested.

407
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,529
Could you freshen this?

408
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:25,132
So Blue Bonnet
is the girl in pigtails?

409
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,068
Mary Ann.

410
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:29,070
"Gilligan's Island"
always works.

411
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:31,372
Every brand is represented.

412
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:34,776
So Fleischmann's is
the Marilyn Monroe redhead?

413
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,044
I don't know who's Ginger.

414
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,812
Probably Parkay.

415
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:40,547
Then you've got
Thurston Howell--

416
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:42,382
Imperial with the crown.

417
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,651
I think the one that's wide
open is the Professor.

418
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:46,987
Facts and figures,
health benefits.

419
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,355
Some kind of formula.

420
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:49,756
They're all made differently,

421
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,191
even if it's just location.

422
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:53,026
No, I find it interesting

423
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,495
that you've broken this down
into a formula.

424
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,485
There's a lot of bridges
to Manhattan.

425
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:01,433
You don't have any tricks for
when you're stuck other than...

426
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,102
<i>Are we stuck already?</i>

427
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:05,705
Let's take the competition
to a broader level.

428
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:09,441
Let's say there are more margarines
than characters on your TV show.

429
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:11,175
They all have
something in common.

430
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,677
They all want off the island.

431
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,913
No, they're all not butter.

432
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:17,782
- No one prefers margarine.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

433
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:19,584
I have to eat something.

434
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:21,753
Doesn't ice count?

435
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:23,922
I'd settle for some more toast.

436
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:25,724
Ahem.

437
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:32,596
It's morning.

438
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:36,133
We know because we see
the rooster crow.

439
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:39,770
A farmer's wife sets pancakes
on the kitchen table.

440
00:24:39,804 --> 00:24:42,539
She puts a pat
of margarine on top.

441
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:46,175
Then sets the dish down next
to the yellowest fried eggs,

442
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:47,977
a loaf of homemade bread,

443
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:51,014
<i>and a beading pitcher</i>
<i>of heavy cream.</i>

444
00:24:51,048 --> 00:24:53,883
Syrup pours.

445
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:58,287
A smile comes over
their Dorothea Lange faces.

446
00:24:58,321 --> 00:25:00,956
Two things-- cows

447
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,724
because she's a dairy
farmer's wife,

448
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,325
and I want bacon.

449
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,494
It's not up for debate.

450
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:21,318
_

451
00:25:43,763 --> 00:25:45,731
<i>Just a minute.</i>

452
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:49,235
I said just a minute.

453
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:51,237
I thought you said come in.

454
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:54,672
I got everyone's paperwork.
I just wanted to drop them off.

455
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:56,441
You look a little wan.

456
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,143
I think I have food poisoning.

457
00:25:58,177 --> 00:25:59,877
Do you want some ice water?

458
00:25:59,912 --> 00:26:02,380
Oh! God...

459
00:26:04,283 --> 00:26:06,284
Do you have your appendix?

460
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,453
- It's the other side.
- You can't stay here.

461
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:11,522
And I can't leave, either.

462
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:19,363
Just walk with me and I'll
bother you all the way out.

463
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:21,732
No one will know.

464
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:32,308
So I get the laxative
people into the booth

465
00:26:32,343 --> 00:26:34,844
and I record three
or four spots at one time.

466
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:37,046
Who talked Topaz
into television?

467
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,549
I did, but then
Margie took it over.

468
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:42,083
The client still
calls me Peggy.

469
00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:44,153
Everybody, everybody.

470
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:45,787
I'm taking a survey.

471
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:49,491
It's Eugene McCarthy
versus Bobby Kennedy.

472
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,426
How many for Kennedy?

473
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:53,595
Show of hands.

474
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,997
But Humphrey
has all the delegates.

475
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,365
I'm voting for Nixon.

476
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,300
Oh, I knew it, Mathis.

477
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:01,769
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

478
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:04,438
Don't you have any hope?

479
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,341
I'm for Bobby.

480
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:10,511
Well, I... Ted?

481
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:13,480
You okay?

482
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,950
Why don't you call it a day?

483
00:27:17,985 --> 00:27:20,620
Come on.

484
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:23,190
- What about him?
- Let him sleep it off.

485
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:29,662
Ted, come on.

486
00:27:29,696 --> 00:27:31,763
I'm fine.

487
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:50,513
Drink that.

488
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:53,983
- Is that urine?
- It's the pipes.

489
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:55,951
The babysitter's
agreed to stay,

490
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:58,954
but no word from your
mother, so I'm not leaving.

491
00:27:58,989 --> 00:28:01,389
She's probably still
in the Catskills.

492
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:03,358
Remember Rip Van Winkle?

493
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:04,892
You like that story?

494
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:07,028
I know it.
I could tell it to you.

495
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,831
No, you should go.

496
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:12,267
Who knows what 20 years
will do to this place.

497
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:14,702
I have no place to go.

498
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:21,275
What's gonna happen to Kevin?

499
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:23,910
He'll either end up
with my mother

500
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,879
or Greg's parents.

501
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,748
It's just food poisoning.

502
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,119
No, that's not what it is.

503
00:28:33,154 --> 00:28:35,221
Come on.
Let's go.

504
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,789
I've got you.

505
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:47,200
Excuse me,
Nurse... Finnegan.

506
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:49,801
I see how busy you are, but
can I trouble you a moment?

507
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:52,037
Doctors will see you
the moment they can.

508
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:53,805
No, it's not about that.

509
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,542
It's just, well,
I'm such a fool

510
00:28:56,576 --> 00:28:58,743
and I suppose I was
trying to be a gentleman,

511
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,446
- but my friend here, she--
- Don't.

512
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:03,915
We don't need to see a doctor.

513
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:07,285
I'm sure it's something that would be
covered by your medical expertise.

514
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,420
What are you talking about?

515
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:11,222
She's a little embarrassed,

516
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:13,491
but she drank furniture polish.

517
00:29:13,525 --> 00:29:15,293
Honey, why'd you do that?

518
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:18,429
She wasn't wearing her glasses.

519
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:21,198
You do need to see a doctor.
Why didn't you tell me that?

520
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:22,799
I'm sorry. I really
never know what to do.

521
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,267
I thought I'd just
leave it up to you.

522
00:29:24,302 --> 00:29:27,070
Okay, sweetheart.
Ramirez.

523
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:30,106
Take her to bed four.

524
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:35,111
She'll be fine.

525
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:56,531
You look perfect.

526
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:59,166
Well, I had three hours
to get ready.

527
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,236
I don't know if the shoes go.

528
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,803
They do.

529
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:08,609
Where are we going?

530
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:11,978
We're not going anywhere.

531
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:13,747
Are you kidding me?

532
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:16,450
Why would you think
you're going anywhere?

533
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:18,785
You are for me.

534
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:22,356
You exist in this room
for my pleasure.

535
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:26,425
Are we going to eat?

536
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,561
Don't ask any more questions.

537
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:30,062
Take off your dress.

538
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,833
Take off everything for me.

539
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,133
Like that?

540
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:50,304
I think you look
worse than I do.

541
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:54,575
Well, I slept on
the floor of my office.

542
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:56,276
They didn't give you a couch?

543
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:59,213
I couldn't find it.
Draper knocked me out.

544
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:01,314
Not literally.

545
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:04,984
I'm sure there's
a lot of work to do.

546
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:06,953
It's got nothing
to do with work.

547
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:09,722
He seems more interested in me
than he is in the work.

548
00:32:09,756 --> 00:32:11,890
But you're not
very interesting.

549
00:32:11,924 --> 00:32:14,727
He doesn't know that.

550
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:17,295
What's he like?

551
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:22,033
He's mysterious.

552
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:24,235
But I can't tell
if he's putting it on.

553
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:27,605
He doesn't talk
for long stretches,

554
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:30,307
and then he's
incredibly eloquent.

555
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:32,910
He's very successful.

556
00:32:32,944 --> 00:32:35,680
You didn't think
he was charmless, did you?

557
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:37,715
You learned to work with me.

558
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,283
And look at you.

559
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:43,420
If I wait patiently
by the river,

560
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:45,922
the body of my enemy
will float by.

561
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:49,125
Such a waste of energy.

562
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:52,596
Give him the early rounds.
He'll tire himself out.

563
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:58,334
Go home, shower,

564
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:01,737
walk back in there
like you own half the place.

565
00:33:20,256 --> 00:33:22,257
I'll be back at dinnertime.

566
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,825
Because you live here.

567
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:25,294
No, I don't.

568
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:26,895
There's a hamper
full of laundry

569
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,629
and a razor in the sink.

570
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:30,264
Is Trudy finished with you?

571
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,799
This is our pied-à-terre.

572
00:33:31,833 --> 00:33:33,734
Does your father
bring prostitutes here

573
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:35,202
or is it just for yours?

574
00:33:35,237 --> 00:33:36,770
I want to be taken home.

575
00:33:36,805 --> 00:33:39,340
Your apartment's
been overrun with vermin.

576
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:40,975
They're spraying all day.

577
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:43,144
Oh.

578
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:46,112
I didn't remember that.
I want to get my things.

579
00:33:46,147 --> 00:33:49,782
It's raining very hard out
and it's, well--

580
00:33:49,817 --> 00:33:51,717
it's St. Patrick's Day.

581
00:33:51,752 --> 00:33:54,354
- It's May.
- No, it's not.

582
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:57,690
And who knows what's out there?

583
00:34:00,393 --> 00:34:03,728
I'll have the cook make
your favorite for dinner.

584
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:27,557
- Morning.
- You look fresh.

585
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:29,726
Where's my secretary?

586
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:31,593
Or is this how
they do it at CGC,

587
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,495
just let yourself in?

588
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,964
I didn't want to wait out there

589
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:37,967
because this whole visit
is confidential.

590
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:39,802
You want to quit already?

591
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,073
When you told me
about the merger,

592
00:34:44,107 --> 00:34:46,308
I hoped he would
rub off on you,

593
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:48,409
not the other way around.

594
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,912
He's getting
everything he wants

595
00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:53,381
and obviously
you're on his side.

596
00:34:53,415 --> 00:34:55,684
Why did you do it at all
if there are sides?

597
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,318
You could have just tried
to hire me back.

598
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:58,853
You never even
asked me to lunch.

599
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,923
Yes, Peggy, we risked
our entire company

600
00:35:02,957 --> 00:35:05,258
just so I could have you in
this office complaining again.

601
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:07,494
Well, he can't drink like you.

602
00:35:07,528 --> 00:35:08,996
And you must know that
because nobody can.

603
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,464
- Peggy, he's a grown man.
- So are you.

604
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,001
Move forward.

605
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,541
You're going to be fine.
With Burt Peterson gone,

606
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:24,476
Kenny in Detroit, everything's
going to fall in your in-box.

607
00:35:24,511 --> 00:35:26,045
What about Cutler?

608
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,513
What about every time
there's a change around here,

609
00:35:27,547 --> 00:35:29,182
I get knocked down
to a worse office?

610
00:35:29,216 --> 00:35:31,184
Come in, Scarlett.

611
00:35:31,218 --> 00:35:33,786
Mr. Campbell,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

612
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:35,220
but you're needed on the phone.

613
00:35:35,254 --> 00:35:36,822
What now, Clara?

614
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:40,525
Is she injured?

615
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,327
No, but there's been a fire.

616
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:44,830
Call Henry at Mohawk.
See if he can meet tomorrow.

617
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:47,165
I have no idea how long
this will take.

618
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,135
Trudy?

619
00:35:58,076 --> 00:36:00,510
I don't know what it is.

620
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:03,447
I just don't want
to think about anything.

621
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:05,716
Who told you
you were allowed to think?

622
00:36:11,422 --> 00:36:15,792
So, what do I do now?

623
00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:21,265
You fall asleep
the minute I close that door.

624
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,533
I'm flying upstate,

625
00:36:24,568 --> 00:36:28,237
and when I come back,
I want you ready for me.

626
00:36:30,507 --> 00:36:33,208
I can do that
standing on my head.

627
00:36:41,817 --> 00:36:43,652
And I'm taking this.

628
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:47,722
Really?
Come on.

629
00:36:47,757 --> 00:36:49,491
I'm taking it.

630
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:56,530
Something's come up.
Do you have a minute for Clara?

631
00:36:57,565 --> 00:36:59,566
Pete Campbell's secretary.

632
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:01,502
Certainly.

633
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,774
Mr. Campbell had an emergency
and Mr. Draper is out,

634
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,909
so I wanted to make sure you
knew that we were rescheduling

635
00:37:08,943 --> 00:37:10,444
this afternoon's
meeting with Mohawk.

636
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,011
Absolutely not.

637
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:13,513
What the hell
is going on around here?

638
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:15,315
Ready to go?

639
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:17,983
I am, but apparently Pete
Campbell wants to move it.

640
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:20,419
We can't cancel
the meeting to show a client

641
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:22,354
how important he is.
When can he go?

642
00:37:22,388 --> 00:37:23,989
It doesn't matter. We should
go up there right away.

643
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:26,591
It's raining pretty hard.
We can wait a couple hours.

644
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:30,462
Don't worry about that. Once we're above
the clouds, it's sunny as summer.

645
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,104
How long have you
been doing this?

646
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:41,840
Not now.

647
00:37:52,483 --> 00:37:54,351
There we go.

648
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:56,753
You can relax now.
We're leveled off.

649
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:00,523
I am relaxed.

650
00:38:06,463 --> 00:38:08,464
Sometimes when you're flying,

651
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:11,033
you think you're right side up,
but you're really upside down.

652
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:14,337
Really?

653
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,339
Got to watch your instruments.

654
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:28,850
You don't want to take in
the wonder of God's majesty?

655
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:32,053
I like to read on planes.
I don't like to talk.

656
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:33,821
But you're gonna talk
to Henry Lammott.

657
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:35,857
I mean, you're the one
that knows him.

658
00:38:35,892 --> 00:38:38,292
Does it matter?

659
00:38:38,326 --> 00:38:40,127
No matter what I say,

660
00:38:40,161 --> 00:38:42,863
you're the guy who flew us
up here in his own plane.

661
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,833
I guess that's true.

662
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:55,441
I don't know if Joanie's awake.

663
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:57,110
I really don't need to see her.

664
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:59,078
You can just give
Kevin my gift.

665
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:03,950
Oh. Oh.

666
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:07,353
Hello.

667
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,422
I really wasn't planning
on dropping in.

668
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,926
I just wanted to see
if you were feeling better.

669
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,262
The hospital wouldn't tell me anything
because I'm not immediate family.

670
00:39:17,297 --> 00:39:19,097
He's two years old.
He'll play with the bow.

671
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:21,366
Sit down. Have a snack.

672
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,269
No, that's all. Don't want to be
away from the office too long.

673
00:39:24,304 --> 00:39:26,437
Although I left
my overcoat on my chair,

674
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:28,906
so they know I'm there.

675
00:39:28,941 --> 00:39:32,944
Well, it's nice meeting you.

676
00:39:39,217 --> 00:39:41,085
He's adorable.

677
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,186
He's too young.

678
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,055
I can tell you from experience

679
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:47,857
that younger men are not
intimidated by powerful women.

680
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:51,194
- He's not interested.
- He saved your life.

681
00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:53,529
It was just a cyst on my ovary.

682
00:39:53,564 --> 00:39:56,899
I would have been fine.
He's worrying about his job.

683
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:59,301
Well, why wouldn't he?

684
00:39:59,336 --> 00:40:01,403
It doesn't take away
what he did.

685
00:40:01,438 --> 00:40:03,638
Honestly, Joan, every good deed

686
00:40:03,673 --> 00:40:05,607
is not part of a plan.

687
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:13,315
She left the teakettle on.
It was mostly smoke.

688
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,416
Can you get Henry Lammott
on the phone?

689
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,322
I will, but Mr. Lammott
already called for you.

690
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:23,924
Don and Ted thought
it was best not to wait.

691
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:26,760
Really?
They went without me?

692
00:40:26,795 --> 00:40:29,930
Yes. Apparently it
went very well.

693
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:32,565
Damn it, Clara.
They went without me.

694
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,968
Therefore, it did not
go very well.

695
00:40:35,003 --> 00:40:38,638
You do understand that your
employment here is tied to me?

696
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,307
And if things
happen without me,

697
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:42,342
they'll eventually
happen without you.

698
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:47,480
Don't feel bad that you were
taking care of your mother.

699
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,515
My mother can go to hell.

700
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:51,517
Ted Chaough can fly her there.

701
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:54,286
Do you want me to get
Mr. Lammott on the phone?

702
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:57,456
Can you give me a minute?

703
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,101
I'm here.

704
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:18,239
Where are you going?

705
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:21,308
I think it's time to go home.

706
00:41:21,343 --> 00:41:22,744
Not yet.

707
00:41:22,778 --> 00:41:25,346
I think this is over.

708
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,050
It's over when I say it's over.

709
00:41:33,354 --> 00:41:37,124
I had a dream that you
crashed in that plane.

710
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,494
But I'm back.

711
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,063
I dreamt I went to your funeral

712
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:44,765
and Megan cried on my shoulder.

713
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:48,901
- Stop it.
- And then I went back to Arnold

714
00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:52,171
and I made love to him
and I said,

715
00:41:52,205 --> 00:41:55,941
"I've been away,
but I'm home."

716
00:41:55,976 --> 00:41:58,744
It means you missed me.

717
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:02,581
No.

718
00:42:05,918 --> 00:42:09,420
It means it's time
to really go home.

719
00:42:11,824 --> 00:42:14,059
This is over,

720
00:42:14,093 --> 00:42:16,094
and not just this.

721
00:42:27,338 --> 00:42:30,107
It's easy to give up something
when you're satisfied.

722
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,744
It's easy to give up something

723
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:35,579
when you're ashamed.

724
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,286
Please.

725
00:42:56,632 --> 00:42:58,433
Let's go.

726
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:34,868
Burt Peterson's gone.
That leaves me,

727
00:43:34,902 --> 00:43:37,036
Jim Torkelson,
and Lawrence Harris.

728
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:40,172
You've got Roger, Pete,
Ken, and Bob Benson.

729
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:42,507
But you've got your creatives
Peggy, Cecil, and Beanie.

730
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:44,476
We lost Margie, Koch,
and Steve Hagan.

731
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,812
I don't know who Peggy
counts for, but we need Bob.

732
00:43:46,846 --> 00:43:50,248
Bob's got to go.
Last hired, first fired.

733
00:43:54,853 --> 00:43:57,889
Very well.

734
00:43:57,923 --> 00:44:00,892
But before I cross him off,
let me remind you

735
00:44:00,926 --> 00:44:03,060
that Bob has been very
involved in Ken's accounts,

736
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:05,128
and with Ken servicing Detroit,

737
00:44:05,163 --> 00:44:06,629
I don't know how long it'll
take Lawrence to catch up.

738
00:44:06,664 --> 00:44:08,865
Fine, Lawrence is gone.
Are we done here?

739
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:14,370
The secretarial staff?

740
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:52,206
And instead of being afraid,

741
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,775
I realized I should just ask
for a couple of weeks off.

742
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:58,946
They write people out
all the time.

743
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,014
Or I could shoot in advance

744
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:03,383
and maybe we could go
to Honolulu again.

745
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,819
<i>This time without business.</i>

746
00:45:05,854 --> 00:45:08,787
I just thought it would
be fun to go on a trip,

747
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:11,423
the two of us for a bit
without the kids.

748
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:29,140
Peter.

749
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:31,276
They shot
that poor Kennedy boy.

750
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,144
That was years ago, Mother.

751
00:45:33,179 --> 00:45:35,513
I just saw it
on the television.

752
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:38,449
It's 6:00 AM.

753
00:45:38,484 --> 00:45:40,684
You'll be late for school.

754
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:42,452
Please just let me sleep.

755
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:45,555
I don't understand
what's going on.

756
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,657
They're shooting everybody.

757
00:45:49,594 --> 00:45:51,795
<i>Senator Kennedy then going off</i>
