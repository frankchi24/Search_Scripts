I've seen that look,
and he is in love with you too.

3
00:00:04,657 --> 00:00:06,086
Nothing can happen.

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,820
We are going to
get Ocean Spray.

5
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:10,691
So you need to stop
chasing Sunkist.

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,314
Oh, God...

7
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:15,315
You make me sick!

8
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:16,729
Sally!

9
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:18,997
We want you to familiarize
yourself with Chevy.

10
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,358
That is music to my ears.

11
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:24,453
When there's true love,
it doesn't matter who it is.

12
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:27,538
I don't know where you've gone,

13
00:00:27,698 --> 00:00:29,765
something has to change.

15
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,035
I was waiting up.

16
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:38,972
I didn't want to wake you.

17
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:44,277
- Don.
- What?

18
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:46,812
I don't know what's going on,

19
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:49,748
but you have to pull back on
the throttle a little, honey.

20
00:02:09,835 --> 00:02:11,769
<i>Don, turn off the range.</i>

21
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,078
Sorry, I forgot about them.

22
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:23,447
It's fine.

23
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:27,384
I want to make you
a real breakfast.

24
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:28,818
You look terrible.

25
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,920
So do you.

26
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,629
Just stay home today.

27
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:41,397
Can you do that for me?

28
00:02:46,202 --> 00:02:48,470
Please try and sleep it off.

29
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:13,361
You want to quit
in front of Kenny?

30
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:14,828
He hasn't fired a shot.

31
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:17,397
Whatever you fellas want.

32
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,032
Kenny, you need
to discharge that weapon

33
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,601
before Ray turns us
into the Bataan Death March.

34
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:23,770
You see that tree over there?

35
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,239
Pretend it's Ralph Nerer
and let's go get a drink.

_

51
00:04:15,986 --> 00:04:17,887
I suppose I'm supposed
to believe

52
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:20,523
that you didn't know
that she wasn't me

53
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:23,226
when you took her to the
boathouse and you had your way.

54
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,862
I'm talking to you.

55
00:04:26,896 --> 00:04:28,331
<i>Don't you dare ignore me.</i>

56
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:29,832
A lot of people
laugh at the idea

57
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:31,567
of a girl playing the tuba.

58
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:40,742
- Hello?
<i>- It's me.</i>

59
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:42,444
Your girl said you were home.

60
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:44,446
I am.

61
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,348
If you're too sick to talk,
it can wait.

62
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:47,716
I can talk.

63
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:51,453
It concerns Sally.

64
00:04:56,658 --> 00:04:58,125
What about her?

65
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,160
She's not coming
this weekend either.

66
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:04,331
Oh.

67
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,699
That's too bad.

68
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:07,434
Although you should tell her
if she does come,

69
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:09,702
I'm gonna be working
all weekend.

70
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:11,872
Why would I tell her that?

71
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:17,177
It could have been being
held hostage by that burglar

72
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:19,579
or the fight she had with
her friend after Model UN,

73
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:21,347
but she says she's not
going again.

74
00:05:23,084 --> 00:05:24,850
What do you want me
to do about it?

75
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,989
I don't know that it's a
good thing or a bad thing,

76
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:32,391
but she wants to go away
to a boarding school.

77
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,660
I'll pay for all of it.

78
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:36,528
She has to get in, of course.

79
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:38,397
How much does that cost?

80
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:41,933
Eleanor, Henry's daughter,

81
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:45,103
went there and I think
she'll interview well.

82
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,605
She has good manners
with everyone but me.

83
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,241
<i>She'll get in.</i>

84
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,977
I don't know, Don.
It is Miss Porter's.

85
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,879
Jackie Kennedy went there.

86
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:59,216
You mean
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

87
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,619
What kind of medicine
are you taking for this cold?

88
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,088
Formula 44.

89
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:06,890
Yeah, I bet.

90
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:10,127
Jackie did well twice.

91
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,130
So did you.

92
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,132
- I'm going to go.
- <i>Betts...</i>

93
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:21,204
will you tell her that Megan...

94
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,509
that we both miss her?

95
00:06:26,544 --> 00:06:28,445
Of course.

96
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:43,792
Cranberry, Cran-Apple,

97
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:45,828
Grape-Berry,
that would be Cran-Prune.

98
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,296
Don't let the name fool you.

99
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:50,799
They're all delicious,
my friend.

100
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:53,836
Is that the line?

101
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,104
They are one dried

102
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:58,774
and one fresh fruit
for a new generation.

103
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:01,176
You want to use Vaughn Meader?

104
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,244
I thought they buried
that guy with JFK.

105
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:05,813
No, there was this old salt
who took us around the plant.

106
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:08,249
He had a heavy accent
and a red shirt.

107
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:10,518
Ted called him Rose Kennedy.

108
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:12,152
During all this levity,

109
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:15,723
did you mention that Cran-Prune
sounds like a glass of diarrhea?

110
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,992
When we agreed
to take the blends,

111
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:20,394
we agreed to take the names.

112
00:07:20,428 --> 00:07:22,829
It's got less pucker
than the Cranberry,

113
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:25,331
but it's heavier
than the Cran-Apple.

114
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:28,101
That means
Cran-Apple is light.

115
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:29,403
Light.

116
00:07:29,437 --> 00:07:32,005
- And Cranberry is...
- Sour?

117
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,473
- Bitter?
- Makes your teeth feel weird?

118
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:36,341
It's tart.

119
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:37,943
That's all they keep
saying about the berries.

120
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:40,045
Yes, they do.

121
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,081
You know, I hate to say this
again, but I got to take a leak.

122
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:45,751
Great idea.
Peggy.

123
00:07:45,786 --> 00:07:47,820
You want to get some chowdah?

124
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:54,526
Thought you had to pee.

125
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,828
No, just wanted to see
if I could get him

126
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:58,830
to respond to an idea
that wasn't hers.

127
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,505
You look better.

128
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:21,418
Hello?

129
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,385
I can barely hear you.

130
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:27,623
Oh, hello, Harry.

131
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,730
What?

132
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,566
Listen, I wouldn't
bother you at home.

133
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,934
Obviously I'm on the Coast,
but I've got good news.

134
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,269
You finally found a hooker who
will take traveler's checks?

135
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:43,605
Why did I tell you that?

136
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,908
I got a packet at the desk and
then a phone call from Sunkist.

137
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,009
I told you to drop that.

138
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:49,544
Well, Jeffrey, the fat one,

139
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,112
he finally got a look
at the media plan

140
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:52,914
and suddenly
they're interested in TV.

141
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,282
They've called a meeting with
Sanford, who I think is a decider.

142
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,417
Don't do that.

143
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:00,387
Don, they're talking about two and
a half times the print budget.

144
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,723
We can't.

145
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:05,359
- Why not?
- Because we have a conflict.

146
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:07,294
<i>Ted has Ocean Spray.</i>

147
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:09,262
You should have
told them we withdrew.

148
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:11,130
Adios, Harry.

149
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:15,902
I really didn't want
you to work today.

150
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:17,737
Harry is such
a pain in the ass.

151
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:20,974
Let's get out of here.

152
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:31,349
That was really, really scary.

153
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,688
It was disturbing.

154
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:44,294
Hello.

155
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:48,866
Oh, hello.

156
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,768
That was quite a film.

157
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:52,870
It was terrifying, wasn't it?

158
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:55,439
Well, we were, um...

159
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:58,675
you know we're doing the St.
Joseph's spot based on it

160
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,011
and Peggy and I had an argument

161
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:03,112
about whether there was
a Japanese in the end.

162
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:06,215
You know, when Mia Farrow
walks in and sees the baby

163
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,517
and the devil worshippers
are there.

164
00:10:07,552 --> 00:10:10,520
- There was.
- I know.

165
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:13,557
So you'd both already seen it?

166
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:14,890
Yeah.

167
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:17,225
But obviously she
remembered it better.

168
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,127
She wants a Japanese in the ad.

169
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:22,697
They always have a camera.

170
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:25,800
We're going to grab a bite.
Have you eaten?

171
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,437
I should get going.
I have a date.

172
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:31,540
Yes, well,
don't let us keep you.

173
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,878
So, Don, I see
you're feeling better.

174
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:38,879
I had to get him
out of the house.

175
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:40,581
We can still go eat.

176
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:43,284
I am supposed to throw
around a football.

177
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:45,352
- I should go.
- After you.

178
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,056
Oh, my God.

179
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,934
I would never live
in an apartment that old.

180
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:04,437
There's so many buildings
like that in Montreal.

181
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:06,573
It's creepy.

182
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:08,141
Don?

183
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:11,743
What?
I'm gonna have nightmares.

184
00:11:13,946 --> 00:11:15,981
You know who's not gonna sleep?

185
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:17,749
Why are you
so interested in this?

186
00:11:17,783 --> 00:11:19,318
You're not interested?

187
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:20,919
Honestly, I'm more
troubled by the idea

188
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:23,955
of using "Rosemary's Baby"
for a children's aspirin ad.

189
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,624
Why were they going
to the movies at 5:00?

190
00:11:26,658 --> 00:11:28,526
They didn't think
anybody would be there.

191
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,194
You've been on a soap too long.

192
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:33,231
I don't know.
I guess.

193
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,234
What time is it in California?

194
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:38,402
Three hours earlier.

195
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:42,205
I need to make a phone call.

196
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:46,075
Okay.

197
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,843
What happened?

198
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,612
Come in.

199
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:01,849
What the hell happened?

200
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,985
I'm fine.

201
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,953
Well, obviously not.

202
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:07,522
I thought you were in Detroit.

203
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:09,591
I was.

204
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,526
I told them that
Cynthia was pregnant

205
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,361
and they took me out to
celebrate and they shot me.

206
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:15,329
- What?
- It's not funny.

207
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,566
Chevy is killing me.

208
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:22,903
I hate Detroit.

209
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:26,072
I hate cars.
I hate guns.

210
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:28,909
I don't even want
to look at a steak anymore.

211
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,548
The only way
to get through this

212
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:37,817
is to keep reminding yourself
it's a great account.

213
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:39,919
I'm gonna be a father.

214
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:42,254
- I'm gonna have a family.
- Pull yourself together.

215
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,724
Anyone here would trade
places with you in a second.

216
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:46,758
Did I tell you that
on the way to the hospital,

217
00:12:46,793 --> 00:12:49,027
they tried to stop for lunch?

218
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:52,096
They're fat yahoos in cheap suits.
I'm done.

219
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:54,333
Are you entertaining this idea?

220
00:12:54,367 --> 00:12:57,436
You'll be laughed out of this building
and then out of advertising in general.

221
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,271
It'd be a difficult transition.

222
00:13:00,306 --> 00:13:02,273
Chevy won't like it,

223
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:04,775
but I think they're feeling
pretty guilty right now.

224
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:14,284
Well, if it's in your power...

225
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,654
and you're willing to give up

226
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:19,356
what goes with it,

227
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,291
I would gladly take your place.

228
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:24,627
What about your family?

229
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,330
Trudy and I are separated.

230
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:29,265
I only see Tammy
every other weekend.

231
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:30,734
She won't know the difference.

232
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,769
I'm sorry to hear that.

233
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:35,738
Yes, it's unfortunate.

234
00:13:37,474 --> 00:13:39,174
I don't know what to say.

235
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,444
Say you'll back me up
and I'll be there for you.

236
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,718
Congratulations on the baby.

237
00:13:49,753 --> 00:13:51,552
Thank you.

238
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:01,462
Is he ready?

239
00:14:02,898 --> 00:14:04,365
- Morning.
- Morning.

240
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,200
- Morning.
- Hello.

241
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:12,005
We have what we think is some
pretty spectacular news.

242
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,774
Crane called from Los Angeles.

243
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:15,609
Sunkist finally looked
at the media plan

244
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:18,044
and enthusiastically embraced
a television campaign

245
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,947
to the tune of $8 million.

246
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:23,816
Great Caesar's ghost.

247
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,853
They don't care that we're
a month into Ocean Spray?

248
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:29,889
Harry said we'd resign.

249
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:32,725
Apparently they were excited
by the spike in color TVs.

250
00:14:32,726 --> 00:14:34,798
Don told them that
was the secret. Color.

251
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:38,196
- When did you tell them that?
- When we were out there.

252
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:40,231
But they wouldn't
leave Harry alone.

253
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,368
You upset, Ted? It's almost
three times the business.

254
00:14:44,403 --> 00:14:47,572
No, I just...

255
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:50,107
well, I'm dreading
making the call.

256
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,843
Well, I'll call Ocean Spray.

257
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:53,678
And the rest of our clients?

258
00:14:53,712 --> 00:14:56,346
Someone has to let them know to
look out for a knife in their back.

259
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,881
You want to turn it down?

260
00:14:57,916 --> 00:15:00,250
Absolutely not.
Don't be an idiot, Ted.

261
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:02,252
Stay out of this, Jim.

262
00:15:02,286 --> 00:15:04,087
Forget about giving
someone your word,

263
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:06,557
which obviously doesn't
mean anything to you...

264
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:09,526
how does it look?

265
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:12,061
The right hand doesn't know
what the left hand is doing.

266
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,665
You're right.

267
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,733
We should work more together.

268
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:19,702
We have to. That's the
message from this.

269
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:22,271
Then it's agreed
that we have a more

270
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:24,106
coherent approach
to new business.

271
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,141
That means no more
surprises, Don.

272
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,177
You're right.
I apologize.

273
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:31,880
But it's a great account.

274
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:33,648
Can we celebrate now?

275
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,888
I think Peggy should be on it.

276
00:15:39,922 --> 00:15:41,957
She has, you know,
juice experience now.

277
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:43,991
That makes sense.

278
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:48,729
What are you doing?

279
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:50,998
Getting ready to do
a little hunting.

280
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:54,134
What's going on?
Mr. Cooper wants to see you.

281
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:58,472
Let's find out.

282
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:01,741
That's a .22. It's not good for
anything but squirrels, you know.

283
00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:07,680
Would you ever leave New
York, Annie Oakley?

284
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:17,523
- Hello, Pete.
- Hello, Bob.

285
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:19,391
Kenny, how are you feeling?

286
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,860
Better than I am right now.

287
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:23,828
Have a seat.

288
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:26,998
Well, shiver me timbers.

289
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:29,967
I'd laugh, but it hurts
like a son of a bitch.

290
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:34,272
For obvious reasons, Ken is
withdrawing from handling Chevy.

291
00:16:34,306 --> 00:16:36,207
You sure you want to do this?

292
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:37,608
I'm positive.

293
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:40,744
Kenny, you know,
I once had a client

294
00:16:40,778 --> 00:16:42,513
cup my wife's breast.

295
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:45,382
Lee Garner, Jr.
made me hold his balls.

296
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:49,453
Well, I'm not resigning Chevy.

297
00:16:49,487 --> 00:16:52,456
I just can't be on the
ground there anymore.

298
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,223
Pete and I have
already discussed it,

299
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:57,360
and I will stay on the business in New York.
They'll want that.

300
00:16:57,394 --> 00:16:59,462
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't reluctant.

301
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:01,897
But I know Ken would do
the same for me.

302
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:05,000
Crocodile tears.
How quaint.

303
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:06,802
Look, I know
everyone's worried,

304
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:09,004
but Bob's going to be a big
help with the transition.

305
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,305
Anything I can do.

306
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,707
In all deference to the weeks

307
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,110
Bob spent trying
to develop ties with Chevy,

308
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,245
I think it's best
if I bring in my own team.

309
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,580
That's a dumb idea.

310
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:20,682
Any continuity
preserves the belief

311
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:22,684
that service has not changed.

312
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:27,321
It's nothing about Bob
in particular,

313
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:30,224
but isn't it better
to create the belief

314
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:32,226
that service has improved?

315
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,496
Pete, you're going to need to know
where the landmines are buried.

316
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,332
I'd listen to the cyclops, Pete.

317
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:41,635
I think maybe I'm keeping you
from discussing this freely.

318
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,439
I understand Pete's objections,

319
00:17:46,474 --> 00:17:48,741
but I will do
whatever is decided.

320
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,583
Pete, there's nothing
to discuss.

321
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,683
I like Bob, Chevy likes Bob.

322
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:00,552
And if you don't like Bob,

323
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:02,588
we can find someone who does.

324
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,993
Of course.

325
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:11,830
By the way, thank you,

326
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:14,465
all of you, for having
this trust in me.

327
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:26,977
Is there a problem?

328
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:28,379
I don't want to work with you.

329
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:29,813
I don't want to stay
in a hotel with you.

330
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:32,549
- You're sick.
- Why would you say that?

331
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:36,553
So you didn't profess
your love to me?

332
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:40,123
Only my admiration,
which is waning quickly.

333
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:43,126
This is not about my own interests.
I care about Chevy.

334
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:47,329
You should watch
what you say to people.

335
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:51,133
Is that right?

336
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:53,202
Congratulations.

337
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:55,371
Can you believe this guy?

338
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,975
- So?
- So what?

339
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:10,396
Can I have one?

340
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:16,268
Are you anxious?

341
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,737
I expect you to sail
through this interview.

342
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:21,306
Jeez, I wasn't nervous
about it a minute ago.

343
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:25,244
I hope it doesn't ruin it
that I'm excited for you.

344
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,179
When I was in 10th grade,
my friend Annie left--

345
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:30,449
To go to Rosemary Hall.
I know, you told me.

346
00:19:31,683 --> 00:19:33,951
Did I tell you
she hated her mother?

347
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,220
Good for her.

348
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,259
Is it about getting
away from boys?

349
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:44,262
If I say yes,
will you stop asking?

350
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:47,430
I'm proposing some reasons because
you aren't being very forthcoming.

351
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:53,803
Sally, I can turn
this car around.

352
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:59,108
I want to be a grown-up, but I know
how important my education is.

353
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,213
Oh.

354
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:12,354
Well, congratulations.

355
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:14,823
You log a few months on that,
you can work anywhere.

356
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:16,625
I'm not looking anymore.

357
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,561
So what is this?
That old joke

358
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:19,960
"Hell, I'm telling everyone"?

359
00:20:19,995 --> 00:20:23,264
No, I'm calling on behalf
of a young account man

360
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:26,234
whom we love, but can't promote
because Draper doesn't like him.

361
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,536
So you're looking
for an account man?

362
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:30,171
You know you can't work here.

363
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,609
I'll be frank.

364
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,411
I got to get this kid
out of here

365
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,879
and he's not going
to call you himself.

366
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:42,148
I'd love to present
some concrete options to him

367
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:44,251
when I push him out the door.
I just need leads.

368
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,652
He doesn't have
to land anything.

369
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:48,121
He must be pretty good
if he's in your way.

370
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:50,591
He's eager to please.

371
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,492
Handsome.
His name is Bob Benson.

372
00:20:53,527 --> 00:20:56,462
He has a blue blood connection
to Brown Brothers Harriman.

373
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:59,298
Beloit, Wharton. I'll send
over his personnel file.

374
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,766
And I'll send over a bill.

375
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,202
Make it an even grand.
Cash.

376
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,238
No, no, no, no.

377
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:09,139
_

378
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:11,185
_

379
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:12,988
_

380
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,858
_

381
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,988
- What going on in there?
- Someone's having a good time.

382
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:39,469
You do realize this is the best
picture these people will ever take?

383
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:42,305
We were thinking about putting
this old man in a wig

384
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,407
because he looks
so much like Ruth Gordon.

385
00:21:47,378 --> 00:21:49,912
- Fill me in.
- That's a great idea.

386
00:21:49,946 --> 00:21:52,749
The conceit is that it's shot
from the baby's point of view.

387
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:54,517
No, no, let's do
the ad for him.

388
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,184
Joan, come here.

389
00:21:57,287 --> 00:21:58,887
Can I do it from here?

390
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:00,422
No.

391
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:03,157
So, Don, you are
the camera and the baby.

392
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:06,226
We might have the end of the basinet
right at the front of the frame.

393
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:08,462
Maybe see some kicking
toes under a blanket.

394
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:10,164
Should I get down
a little lower?

395
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:12,199
No, that's fine.

396
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,302
Okay, it's dark.

397
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:16,304
Fish-eye lens,
you're the baby.

398
00:22:16,338 --> 00:22:18,672
Just, "Whaa!
Whaa!"

399
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:23,075
- You do that.
- Whaa! Whaa! Whaa!

400
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,444
Okay.

401
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:26,446
So there's a crowd.
Eight or nine people.

402
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,316
It's the whole coven. And there's
a crazy little old lady.

403
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,051
What you need
is a mustard plaster.

404
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,687
And then there's
this wrinkled old man.

405
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:35,987
You need a compress.

406
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,623
And then a Jewish
neighbor lady.

407
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,692
How about a bowl
of chicken soup?

408
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,827
<i>Anyway, there's one
more of those, maybe.</i>

409
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,162
Then they all start
crowding in on you.

410
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,298
And the Japanese
takes a picture

411
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,500
and the flash turns it white.

412
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,669
Then you see the beautiful,
radiant young mother.

413
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,909
You don't need anyone's
help but St. Joseph's.

414
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,514
Usually with things like this, it
depends on you knowing the movie.

415
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,650
But I think this
works on its own.

416
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:08,218
I told you it was good.

417
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:09,453
That's a lot of people.

418
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:11,355
You need to feel
the conspiracy.

419
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,623
You want me to come to casting?

420
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,559
Sure, but I'm just gonna watch.

421
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,694
It was all her.

422
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:20,897
Casting's on the West Side.
You should go.

423
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:29,505
That's a lot of people.

424
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:31,907
I didn't want to dampen
the enthusiasm,

425
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:34,477
but the approved budget
is $15,000.

426
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:38,513
There's at least $35,000
in residuals alone here.

427
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:40,248
What did
St. Joseph's say?

428
00:23:40,282 --> 00:23:42,116
They haven't seen
the new budget.

429
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,051
So who's paying for casting?

430
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,820
We are.

431
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:48,256
But Ted seems confident
they'll be good for it.

432
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,392
So he wants to spring it on
them at the pre-pro meeting

433
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:52,226
after we're 10 grand
out of pocket?

434
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,995
I don't know, Don.
I don't tell him what to do.

435
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:07,875
And Diplomacy Club.

436
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:09,643
I don't know if she told
you in the interview,

437
00:24:09,677 --> 00:24:12,111
but Henry thinks she can
be an ambassador one day.

438
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:14,814
It's heartwarming to see
such a proud mother.

439
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:19,385
Well, Sally going away
is going to be difficult,

440
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,954
but, of course, I wanted it
for myself way back when.

441
00:24:21,988 --> 00:24:23,856
And in this day and age,
it's overwhelming

442
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:26,458
to raise a young girl,
let alone be one.

443
00:24:26,492 --> 00:24:28,026
Beautifully put.

444
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,161
Now, Sally,
during your overnight

445
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:32,030
and tomorrow in class,

446
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:35,233
I want you to keep in mind, and
I'm sure your mother would agree,

447
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,969
this is as much for you
to find out about us

448
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,105
as it is for us
to find out about you.

449
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:48,913
Carla, could you fetch Millicent
Turner from study hall?

450
00:24:49,915 --> 00:24:51,449
You have fun.

451
00:24:51,483 --> 00:24:53,050
I'll be back
in the morning around--

452
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:54,635
2:30 would be perfect.

453
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,191
Thank you again.

454
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:11,233
<i>Mr. Campbell, your</i>
<i>mother is here to see you.</i>

455
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:16,638
What are you
doing here, Mother?

456
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:18,373
Josephine, you have
my phone number.

457
00:25:18,374 --> 00:25:20,209
This doesn't concern her.

458
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,260
I'm here for my passport.

459
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:26,247
I'm planning a voyage.
And I spoke to Manolo.

460
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:28,283
I forbade you to see him.

461
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,085
Well, he's very upset
about the way

462
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:31,953
you're treating
his friend Bob Benson.

463
00:25:31,987 --> 00:25:34,054
That Spanish fly.

464
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:35,723
Why are you still
in contact with him?

465
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:38,258
- I ran into him.
- Where?

466
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:40,160
I don't remember.

467
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:44,098
Tell Manolo that I almost
threw you down the steps

468
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:45,566
when you brought up his friend.

469
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:48,368
Peter, I am still your mother.

470
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:50,537
I don't have your passport.

471
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:52,973
I'm sure it's expired
like everything else you own.

472
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:54,574
Josephine!

473
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:56,610
You're endangering
your position.

474
00:26:00,755 --> 00:26:02,456
So, this used to be
the living room.

475
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,390
And, of course, you have to walk
through my room to get to her room,

476
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:06,792
but we switch over
at Christmas.

477
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:08,894
I'd rather have
my own room, too.

478
00:26:08,928 --> 00:26:11,464
Oh, hello.

479
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:13,065
You must be Sally.

480
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:14,800
I'm Mandy.
Move over.

481
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,372
Sally's family lives
in Rye and Manhattan.

482
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:22,541
Let me guess, dad's remarried,

483
00:26:22,575 --> 00:26:24,042
mom's fat and sad.

484
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:26,678
No, they're both remarried,

485
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,980
but my dad's wife is my age.

486
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:33,017
Well, I'd like
to feel sorry for you,

487
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:35,187
but things are about
to get worse.

488
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,822
Don't you like it here?

489
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:40,824
You're not allowed
to talk anymore.

490
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:44,061
Our opinion is crucial
to your acceptance.

491
00:26:44,095 --> 00:26:45,829
And I can't believe
no one told you

492
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:49,233
that you were supposed
to look after us.

493
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:51,968
You didn't bring a bottle
or some cigarettes at least?

494
00:26:53,103 --> 00:26:54,571
I probably have some money.

495
00:26:55,606 --> 00:26:57,473
You think we need money?

496
00:26:57,508 --> 00:26:59,242
You should call your mother.

497
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:00,943
Tell her that you're useless.

498
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:03,779
I can get you
anything you want.

499
00:27:03,814 --> 00:27:05,415
She keeps talking.

500
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,850
Now what do we want?

501
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:15,557
How was casting?

502
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,860
It was interrupted by a phone
call from St. Joseph's.

503
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:20,529
Did you send over a budget?

504
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:23,265
Yes, but relax.
I talked to them.

505
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:24,965
I played the bad guy.
They'll be fine.

506
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:27,034
No, they won't be.

507
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:30,271
They called me
at casting to stop it.

508
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:32,139
Now I have to turn
a no into a yes.

509
00:27:32,173 --> 00:27:33,974
You were gonna have
to do that anyway.

510
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:36,444
I couldn't even tell Peggy.

511
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:38,546
Did you tell her
how expensive it was?

512
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,381
It's great work
and you know it.

513
00:27:41,415 --> 00:27:44,050
St. Joseph's has been doing
the same ad for 20 years.

514
00:27:44,084 --> 00:27:45,918
They're bread and butter.
Why did you pick them to push?

515
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:49,154
They kept asking me for their
"plop plop fizz fizz."

516
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:51,523
And all of a sudden
she comes up with this.

517
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:54,092
She can smell the Clio, Don.

518
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:56,295
Remember your first big ad?

519
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:57,863
She has her heart set on it.

520
00:27:57,897 --> 00:28:01,500
It's okay, Ted.
I get it.

521
00:28:04,536 --> 00:28:06,937
You're right.
They're coming in tomorrow.

522
00:28:06,972 --> 00:28:08,706
Just back me up on this?

523
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:10,074
Of course.

524
00:28:10,108 --> 00:28:12,310
I've got to go
over that budget.

525
00:28:21,886 --> 00:28:24,354
Yeah, she stayed skinny,

526
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:27,190
but her breath smelled
like vomit all the time.

527
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:30,661
I think it's time for
you girls to go to bed.

528
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:32,962
You hemmed your skirt.

529
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:35,698
My friend Sandy used a stapler.

530
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:38,668
Then by the time she went home,
her legs were all scratched.

531
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:41,604
Stand still.
Sally, you there?

532
00:28:42,706 --> 00:28:45,508
Hello.

533
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,414
That was pretty fast.

534
00:28:52,448 --> 00:28:53,648
Hey.

535
00:28:53,683 --> 00:28:56,318
I'm Mandy
and this is Millicent.

536
00:28:56,352 --> 00:28:58,286
Hold on, do you
have a rope for him?

537
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,855
Millicent, go get him.

538
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:02,624
<i>Go around the front.</i>

539
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:07,961
Nice digs.
I'm Glen, by the way.

540
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:09,797
Did you have trouble
finding us?

541
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,065
Rolo's driven by before.

542
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:13,900
Then I just looked for Snoopy.

543
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:15,669
Do you want a cigarette?

544
00:29:15,704 --> 00:29:18,439
No, but I wouldn't
mind a drink.

545
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:20,874
Rolo brought
something to smoke.

546
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:25,678
How you been?
How are you folks?

547
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:27,547
Can we drink it straight?

548
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:29,849
I know how to make
a Tom Collins.

549
00:29:29,883 --> 00:29:32,719
- She's too much.
- She's okay.

550
00:29:34,455 --> 00:29:37,623
I don't think anyone saw us,
but we should keep it quiet.

551
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:39,559
I'm Rolo, by the way.

552
00:29:39,593 --> 00:29:41,493
Nice digs.

553
00:29:41,527 --> 00:29:43,128
What about the proctor?

554
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:45,264
The housemother's
a booze fiend.

555
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:47,299
I'll save some for her.

556
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:49,701
I want to get stoned.

557
00:29:49,736 --> 00:29:51,337
I need a surface.

558
00:29:58,978 --> 00:30:00,378
Here's looking up
your old address.

559
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:15,492
Hello?

560
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:18,595
Look at the two of us,
burning the midnight oil.

561
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:20,964
Something wrong? Did the
messenger find you okay?

562
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:24,567
I'm gonna need more than this kid
Bob Benson's personnel record.

563
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:26,669
Might as well
be written in steam.

564
00:30:26,704 --> 00:30:28,637
What do you mean?

565
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:30,572
I don't even know
if the name is real.

566
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:32,841
I don't know where he went to
college, but it wasn't Beloit.

567
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:34,543
I tried a buddy at Wharton,

568
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:36,445
he said maybe he's just
telling people Wharton,

569
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,847
so he's gonna check the whole
University of Pennsylvania.

570
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:41,984
But it's tough when I don't know
if he's really 28 years old.

571
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:45,353
The most interesting is the
Brown Brothers Harriman job.

572
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:46,955
You told me that.

573
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:48,489
I got that from him.

574
00:30:48,524 --> 00:30:50,892
Well, I have a friend there.

575
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:53,161
Turns out they all
remember Bobby.

576
00:30:53,195 --> 00:30:55,030
He's from West Virginia.

577
00:30:55,064 --> 00:30:58,099
Parents are brother
and sister or something.

578
00:30:58,134 --> 00:31:00,167
He was a manservant
for three years

579
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:01,902
to a senior vice president.

580
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:05,406
He took him to
Europe on the Queen Elizabeth.

581
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,673
Are you kidding me?

582
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:08,242
He had three references,

583
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:11,245
two nonworking numbers at K&E
and a live one at Cunningham.

584
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,213
They said he just
disappeared one day

585
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,882
with an electric pencil sharpener
and the Christmas card list.

586
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,517
So what does that mean?

587
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:20,286
Mostly that his only
job opportunity

588
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:22,355
was someplace dumb enough
not to ask any questions,

589
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:24,390
and so far,
that's just you guys.

590
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,561
I'd offer to return the money,

591
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,096
but I would file this
under valuable information.

592
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:33,065
Yes, of course.

593
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,001
I've never seen
anything like this before.

594
00:31:36,035 --> 00:31:38,437
I have.

595
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:50,414
You can do that
in bed, you know.

596
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,125
Since seventh grade.

597
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:03,461
The Ro is from Ronnie
and the Lo is from Lowell.

598
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:05,261
So they just started
calling me Rolo.

599
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:06,830
And 'cause he rolls
a lot of joints.

600
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:10,266
Should I roll another?

601
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:13,403
Your friend bogarted the last
one and she didn't get any.

602
00:32:13,437 --> 00:32:14,872
I'm really drunk.

603
00:32:14,906 --> 00:32:16,339
You think Millicent's okay?

604
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:18,976
She always freaks out.

605
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,343
What if she runs
screaming down the hallway

606
00:32:21,378 --> 00:32:23,012
and she thinks
her hair is on fire

607
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:26,382
and she's screaming, "Boy on the floor!
Boy on the floor"?

608
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:29,819
Do you two know each other?

609
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:33,389
I think so, but who knows?

610
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:35,457
I was reincarnated.

611
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:37,492
I came back as a fish.

612
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:40,395
You should read my diary.

613
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:46,134
Come on.

614
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,573
Ahem.

615
00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:57,377
Nice shot.

616
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:00,915
I've got good hands.

617
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,286
Do you play basketball?

618
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:14,694
I've been with lots of girls.

619
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:16,796
I know what I'm doing.

620
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:21,201
What kind of music do you like?

621
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:25,539
I don't want to talk anymore.

622
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:32,011
What's going on, Sally?
You called us.

623
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:33,913
You made us drive
all the way over here.

624
00:33:33,948 --> 00:33:35,748
Suddenly you don't want
to fool around?

625
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:37,083
Are you frigid?

626
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:42,955
Glen. Glen, come out.

627
00:33:42,989 --> 00:33:44,556
Hey, come on.
You've got to relax.

628
00:33:44,591 --> 00:33:46,625
What do you want?

629
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:48,359
He won't leave me alone.

630
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:51,529
What the hell, Rolo? I told
you she's like my sister.

631
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,198
I think you're
full of shit, man.

632
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:55,200
You just wanted the good one.

633
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,735
What is going on?

634
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:58,535
He tried to force me.

635
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,905
What?
Damn it, Rolo.

636
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,640
She's a lying little tease.

637
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,609
That's bullshit.

638
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,980
Keep it down.

639
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,650
Get off me, Bishop.

640
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:26,763
Are you suicidal?
I'm your ride home.

641
00:34:35,204 --> 00:34:37,539
He'll be fine.
I got to go.

642
00:34:37,573 --> 00:34:40,976
I don't want to hitch.
Are you all right?

643
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:45,413
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

644
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:48,315
I'm sorry.

645
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,417
Keep in touch.

646
00:34:56,158 --> 00:34:57,625
How do you know him?

647
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,493
We grew up together.

648
00:34:59,528 --> 00:35:01,995
You like trouble, don't you?

649
00:35:12,107 --> 00:35:13,874
Good morning.

650
00:35:13,908 --> 00:35:15,608
Are you joining us?

651
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:18,211
Ted wanted more firepower.

652
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:19,946
I thought I'd pitch in.

653
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,781
I don't understand
what happened.

654
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:25,251
Residuals. Can't let
them sneak up on you.

655
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:27,486
It'll be fine.

656
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:29,355
We always win this one.

657
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:32,157
Well, I see
everything's in order,

658
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:34,459
including our cookies
from Ferrara's.

659
00:35:34,493 --> 00:35:37,195
Byron, you remember
Peggy Olson.

660
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,431
- Mr. Poole, nice to see you again.
- Byron.

661
00:35:39,465 --> 00:35:42,200
And Don Draper, of course,
our other creative director.

662
00:35:42,235 --> 00:35:44,202
Yes, and I'm sorry
about the phone call,

663
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:45,870
but it was a bit of a surprise.

664
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:50,041
But you're here and we are
going to set you at ease.

665
00:35:50,075 --> 00:35:53,177
Now Ted and Peggy will take you
through the creative process

666
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:55,413
that resulted
in this ingenious spot.

667
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,681
I know what it is. I bought
it the day I heard it.

668
00:35:57,715 --> 00:35:59,283
I just paid a lot less for it.

669
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:02,619
Well, as a concept
becomes more developed,

670
00:36:02,654 --> 00:36:04,621
expenses can mount.

671
00:36:04,656 --> 00:36:06,723
We want to do this right.

672
00:36:06,758 --> 00:36:10,327
The cost is still a fraction of the
business we believe it will generate.

673
00:36:10,361 --> 00:36:12,796
Ted, with all due respect,

674
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:14,631
it's not your job
to promise sales.

675
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:17,300
It's your job to deliver work
for the budget agreed to.

676
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:19,301
It turned out to be
more people than we thought.

677
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:21,103
That's why we sent
the budget over.

678
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,606
We didn't want there
to be any surprises.

679
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,775
But this is worth the money.

680
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,677
But this is a surprise.

681
00:36:27,711 --> 00:36:29,745
We agreed to 15,000
and it's 50.

682
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,281
You said specifically

683
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,383
that you wanted
something contemporary

684
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:35,817
with a sense of humor,

685
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:38,419
something that wouldn't
make young parents

686
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:40,288
feel like old people.

687
00:36:40,322 --> 00:36:42,524
This does that and more.

688
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,293
That's not a reason.

689
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:47,195
Well, it should be.

690
00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:50,031
We have enough of a history that
you should trust my judgment.

691
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:52,900
No, I want a reason.

692
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:54,435
I'm entitled.

693
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,138
You know the raft of shit I
caught when this budget came in?

694
00:36:58,673 --> 00:36:59,907
Mr. Plough called me.

695
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:03,144
Uh, I hate to interrupt.

696
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:07,514
I think, Byron, I know
what you want to hear.

697
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:09,516
And it has nothing to do

698
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,685
with the shooting days
or the cast

699
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,321
because you've had
a long and fruitful

700
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:16,923
creative relationship together.

701
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:19,393
I think, and correct me
if I'm wrong,

702
00:37:19,427 --> 00:37:21,594
that when you say
you want a reason,

703
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:24,463
you want to know why
we would push you like this.

704
00:37:24,498 --> 00:37:26,032
It would help.

705
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:29,168
Well, the truth is

706
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:31,770
that I don't think
Ted wants to say.

707
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,209
'Cause it's, well,

708
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:39,777
it's a little bit personal.

709
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,581
In fact, it's very personal.

710
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:50,821
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

711
00:37:50,856 --> 00:37:52,790
Yes, you do.

712
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:03,534
Are you okay, Ted?

713
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,907
I, uh...

714
00:38:10,942 --> 00:38:13,109
It's okay.

715
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:14,977
Tell him, Ted.

716
00:38:16,012 --> 00:38:17,480
You don't want to say anything?

717
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,051
All right.

718
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:24,653
I'll tell him.

719
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:29,558
It's hard for Ted to say,

720
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:33,361
but this was
Frank Gleason's last idea.

721
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:40,135
Really?

722
00:38:40,169 --> 00:38:41,970
Yes.

723
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:44,671
I'm afraid we've gotten
a little sentimental.

724
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:49,577
Damn. You should
have told me that.

725
00:38:53,014 --> 00:38:55,048
I guess I was--
I don't know.

726
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,618
I, uh...

727
00:38:57,652 --> 00:39:00,253
the factor didn't seem
relevant except to us.

728
00:39:00,287 --> 00:39:02,288
I, um...

729
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,359
didn't want to lean on that.

730
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:12,499
Frank was a hell of a guy.

731
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,267
Best I can do is 25.

732
00:39:14,301 --> 00:39:16,835
I don't care if you make these
characters out of cardboard

733
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:19,271
or turn them into cartoons,
you got to reduce the cast.

734
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:22,474
- That's all you get.
- I understand.

735
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:27,112
I'll show you out.

736
00:39:30,183 --> 00:39:32,683
You should come to
Piping Rock this Sunday.

737
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:34,818
Get in a few holes
before all the grass dies.

738
00:39:34,853 --> 00:39:36,754
We'll see.

739
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,757
Was that really necessary?

740
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:44,395
Leave us alone.

741
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:57,807
What was that?

742
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:59,909
That was the best I could do.

743
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:02,979
Do you want me
to tell him the truth?

744
00:40:03,013 --> 00:40:04,613
What are you talking about?

745
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:06,482
You're not thinking
with your head.

746
00:40:06,516 --> 00:40:09,951
That was your solution?
Try and embarrass me?

747
00:40:09,986 --> 00:40:11,853
You're embarrassing yourself.

748
00:40:11,888 --> 00:40:13,755
I know your little girl
has beautiful eyes,

749
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,291
but that doesn't mean
you give her everything.

750
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,092
That has nothing to do with it.

751
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:19,860
Come on, we've all been there.

752
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:21,396
I mean, not with Peggy.

753
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,231
Don't say that about her.

754
00:40:23,265 --> 00:40:25,733
Ted, you're kidding yourself.

755
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:28,603
Everybody sees it.
Just ask your secretary.

756
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:32,840
Your judgment is impaired.

757
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:36,744
You're not thinking
with your head.

758
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,493
Good morning, Bob.

759
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:58,364
How you doing, boss?

760
00:40:58,398 --> 00:41:00,934
I thought for certain you would
have brought me a coffee today.

761
00:41:02,803 --> 00:41:04,604
You want me to go get one?

762
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:09,742
I've always wondered how
you were so expertly servile.

763
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:12,711
But now I know. It used
to be your profession.

764
00:41:15,048 --> 00:41:16,715
What do you want?

765
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,218
Well, for one thing,
I wanted you to stop smiling.

766
00:41:22,155 --> 00:41:23,555
You got it.

767
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:25,757
I've been awake all night
wondering what you do

768
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,259
when you're found out.

769
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:28,893
This must have happened before.

770
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:31,496
I don't know what
you're talking about.

771
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,865
- Who hired you?
- You did.

772
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:35,867
When?

773
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:38,136
I met with Ken.
You walked in,

774
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,704
complimented my tie
and walked out.

775
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:43,340
It was the best day of my life.

776
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:48,445
Well, your fraud
is irrefutable.

777
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:51,081
Can I have a day's head start?

778
00:41:51,115 --> 00:41:52,983
Can you give me that at least

779
00:41:53,017 --> 00:41:54,685
after all I've done for you?

780
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,220
You've done more for
me than I've done for you.

781
00:41:58,255 --> 00:41:59,955
Spectacular.

782
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,359
You don't respond well
to gratitude.

783
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:05,127
So you're just going to run?

784
00:42:05,162 --> 00:42:06,862
I don't believe you.

785
00:42:06,897 --> 00:42:09,332
It terrifies me what
you could do in a day.

786
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:12,534
No, Bob, you're going to get
the benefit of the fact

787
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:14,869
that I've been here before.

788
00:42:14,904 --> 00:42:17,606
I don't know how
people like you do it.

789
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,608
You're certainly
better at it than I am

790
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:21,476
at whatever I do.

791
00:42:21,511 --> 00:42:23,779
But I would like to think
that I have learned

792
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:26,014
not to tangle with
your kind of animal.

793
00:42:26,048 --> 00:42:28,683
I don't understand.

794
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,186
Where you are and who you are

795
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,388
is not my concern.

796
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:37,525
I surrender.

797
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,696
So what does that mean to me?

798
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:47,166
I want you to graciously
accept my apologies.

799
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:50,069
Work alongside me,
but not too closely.

800
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:52,839
Again, I don't understand.

801
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:54,441
Yes, you do.

802
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:56,509
I'm off-limits.

803
00:43:05,284 --> 00:43:08,454
And please, can you find a way

804
00:43:08,488 --> 00:43:11,256
to get your friend
out of my mother's life?

805
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,459
You know she's demented.

806
00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:15,894
Manolo doesn't like women.

807
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,729
Make sure.

808
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:47,956
Sally.

809
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:49,892
What?

810
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,062
So you got what you wanted

811
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:55,730
and now you think
you can be rude.

812
00:43:58,901 --> 00:44:01,436
Fine.

813
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,005
I'm not going to tell you
what Mrs. Beresford said

814
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:06,608
to me when you were
saying good-bye.

815
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:08,810
She talked to you?

816
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:12,913
She said you were
curious and bright

817
00:44:12,947 --> 00:44:15,716
and received glowing reports
from all concerned.

818
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,551
But?

819
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:20,421
She said a girl like you
coming from this family

820
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:22,389
will have plenty of choices

821
00:44:22,424 --> 00:44:24,391
and she hopes you choose them.

822
00:44:24,426 --> 00:44:26,759
Oh.

823
00:44:29,463 --> 00:44:31,997
Now get me a cigarette
and give me some details.

824
00:44:42,742 --> 00:44:44,242
You want one, don't you?

825
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:50,882
Go ahead.

826
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:53,284
I'd rather have you do it in
front of me than behind my back.

827
00:45:00,158 --> 00:45:02,259
I'm sure your father
has given you a beer.

828
00:45:04,095 --> 00:45:06,697
My father has never
given me anything.

829
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:17,874
Did you tell him
that I need to see him?

830
00:45:17,908 --> 00:45:20,810
- He went home.
- When?

831
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:23,580
Right after I told him
you needed to see him.

832
00:45:30,153 --> 00:45:31,987
I know what you did,

833
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,622
I just don't know
why you did it.

834
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:35,090
Calm down.

835
00:45:35,124 --> 00:45:36,792
You want to offer me a drink?

836
00:45:36,826 --> 00:45:38,494
Pretend like you're
helping a little more?

837
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,762
Close the door.

838
00:45:40,797 --> 00:45:42,498
Oh, of course.
You deserve privacy.

839
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:45,467
Look, there's still enough money for the ad.
We'll make it work.

840
00:45:45,502 --> 00:45:47,635
Stop hiding behind the ad.

841
00:45:47,669 --> 00:45:49,436
I know what you did.

842
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:52,072
I saved both of you.

843
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:53,574
How do you think it looks?

844
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:56,511
You hate that he is a good man.

845
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,479
He's not that virtuous.

846
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,415
He's just in love with you.

847
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:03,817
Well, you killed him.

848
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:05,552
You killed the ad.

849
00:46:05,586 --> 00:46:08,755
You killed everything.
You can stop now.

850
00:46:09,891 --> 00:46:12,659
I'm just looking out
for the agency.

851
00:46:14,361 --> 00:46:16,329
You're a monster.
