00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:05,358
Heinz beans.
Something's never changed.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,665
Oh, it's clever.

4
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:08,844
We're going to lose
Jaguar unless

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,296
an arrangement is made, and

6
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,988
it involves you and her.

7
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:13,708
You look radiant, Joan.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,205
You must have heard some terrible
things about me from Don Draper.

9
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:18,839
Now, why would you want to
play for the other team?

10
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:20,304
It's not a game.

11
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:22,311
You don't get another chance
at what you have.

12
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:23,976
I have it all.

Here we go.

15
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:12,242
The one with the fur.

16
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:15,145
You know, I might just take you
up on those theater tickets.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,015
- You must see "Hair."
- Oh, you like that?

18
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,818
- Who doesn't?
- What is it?

19
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:22,687
Oh, it's just filled
with profanity,

20
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:25,589
marijuana smoking,
and simulated sexual acts.

21
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:27,256
Simulated?

22
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,158
And a few songs.

23
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:31,528
The two holiday
chairmanships that remain

24
00:01:31,562 --> 00:01:33,129
are the 4th of July
block party,

25
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:35,198
which really consists of
calling the fire department,

26
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,100
or the Labor Day
Soap Box Derby,

27
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,802
which consists
of calling the hospital.

28
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:41,403
Which one do you do?

29
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:44,439
Our family has claimed
the Easter egg hunt.

30
00:01:44,474 --> 00:01:46,775
Do you dress as a bunny?

31
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,443
Maybe a little cottontail?

32
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:51,614
It's very wholesome.

33
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:53,281
Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:55,684
I'd like to surprise Doug
for his birthday.

35
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,887
Maybe you could get me
the tickets in secret.

36
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,488
Arrangements could be made.

37
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:02,089
Just pick a date
and ring me up.

38
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:06,127
I have to warn you,
I'm from a small town

39
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:09,797
and all of my forays into
Manhattan have been a disaster.

40
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:11,265
We'll make a deal.

41
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,099
Brave your way to Grand Central

42
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,368
and I'll hand off the tickets
and throw in a hot dog.

43
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:16,970
You have another one of those?

44
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:18,672
But you've already
seen "Hair."

45
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,207
Maybe I want to see it again.

46
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,714
Oh, there you are.

47
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:30,983
Gentlemen, it's been
a pleasure.

48
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:33,019
Thank you both
for your hospitality.

49
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:35,154
- Thank you again.
- It was lovely.

50
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,559
Consider what I said
about the pool.

51
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:49,467
That is the end
of the welcome wagon.

52
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:52,737
We'll basically have to move to get
someone to make dinner for us.

53
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,174
What was that about the pool?

54
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,276
He's insistent we all
go skinny-dipping.

55
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,878
Ha! Let him get
his own pool.

56
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:02,846
Turn it off.

57
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:15,192
I need to put it in the
mail today and the tailor.

58
00:03:15,226 --> 00:03:18,260
Sylvia, sweetheart--

59
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:20,296
- Good morning.
- Morning.

60
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,931
Morning.

61
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:26,268
- Honey.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:28,504
I'll swing by
the bank at lunch.

63
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:39,147
I give her cash every month,

64
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:41,917
but I think she's secretly
sending it all to our kid.

65
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:45,053
You don't
have to explain anything.

66
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:47,188
You're lucky your wife works.

67
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:48,689
She doesn't earn much.

68
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:50,591
Not yet.

69
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,029
I forgot my cigarettes.

70
00:03:56,798 --> 00:04:00,334
You got to stop that nonsense.

71
00:04:00,368 --> 00:04:03,370
Listen, don't worry about dinner Wednesday.
We'll have money by then.

72
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:06,106
Looking forward to it.

73
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:28,093
I knew it'd be you.

74
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:30,630
<i>"I've Got Five Dollars"</i>
<i>playing in background</i>

75
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:41,306
It wasn't all bad.
I got me some memories.

76
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,840
And the boy.

77
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,709
Don't know what it is yet.

78
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,311
I mean Dick here.

79
00:04:46,345 --> 00:04:48,580
Well, hello there.

80
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:51,349
This is Mack. He's with
me, so he's your uncle.

81
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:54,718
We thank the Lord for
opening your rooms to us.

82
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:58,222
All I said was, "My sister's
coming with her boy."

83
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,990
Mack's the one that brung ya.

84
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:01,792
I'd do the same for mine.

85
00:05:01,826 --> 00:05:03,394
And, of course,
Ernestine told you

86
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,563
we could always use
a little help around here.

87
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,333
Let's get you off your feet.

88
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:13,403
Dick, you help Mack
with the bags.

89
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:18,308
You keep your eyes down and
mind your own business here.

90
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,314
Good-looking kid.
He yours?

91
00:05:25,348 --> 00:05:27,282
Not that I know.

92
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:30,051
Little boy, find your own sins.

93
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:32,153
Stay away from Mack's.

94
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:36,057
Afternoon, Charlotte.

95
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:42,496
Hey, kid, you were raised
on a farm, am I right?

96
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:44,131
Yes, sir.

97
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:46,900
Well, I'm the rooster
around here, understand?

98
00:05:46,935 --> 00:05:48,736
You help all the hens?

99
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,405
And I'll bring on the day.

100
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,619
I feel bad.

101
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:07,687
You should.
I have to go to work.

102
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:09,522
You get to sleep.

103
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:11,992
No, about dinner.

104
00:06:18,565 --> 00:06:20,499
I thought there was no smoking.

105
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,769
I just found out
the maid smokes.

106
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:32,010
She doesn't sleep
in here, does she?

107
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:38,316
You don't mind sitting
across the table

108
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,285
from your wife and my husband?

109
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,254
I don't think about it.

110
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,556
They're both good company.

111
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:49,860
They are.

112
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:52,863
I suppose that has
nothing to do with this.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,835
This didn't happen.

114
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:01,571
Just in here.

115
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:04,541
You're right.

116
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:11,181
I only said yes because
Arnold wants to impress you.

117
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:13,817
I only said yes because
Megan keeps asking.

118
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,753
- She likes you.
- And I like her.

119
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,998
It's 9:00.
I have to go.

120
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,501
You love to go.

121
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:40,675
Well, it's nice to know
that no matter what

122
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,211
we got something done today.

123
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:54,355
You found it in the cookie jar.

124
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:59,125
I have money,
I just never <i>have</i> money.

125
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:09,001
Mr. Mathis and Mr. Gifford
are waiting outside.

126
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,470
Why didn't you tell me?

127
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:14,574
Because they don't
want to come in.

128
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:18,544
Look, Phyllis,
I've had their job.

129
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,847
I know. And you've
had my job, too.

130
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:24,583
So you know it wouldn't hurt
if you were to act like--

131
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:28,620
if you were as encouraging
to them as you are to me.

132
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:30,489
Why don't you just get me
whatever book you read

133
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:31,857
and save me
these little lectures?

134
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:33,692
More coffee?

135
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:39,129
She's ready for you.

136
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:43,801
Have a seat.

137
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:48,873
- No, don't.
- What's wrong with them?

138
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:51,542
The strategy is Clearasil
stops blemishes

139
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:53,076
that keep you from having fun.

140
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:55,712
That means no one
should be having fun.

141
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,447
Okay.

142
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,649
So we'll just start over.

143
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:03,386
Just a minute.

144
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,690
I don't want you to think
that just because

145
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,692
I have high standards

146
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:12,428
that means I'm not happy
with you.

147
00:09:12,462 --> 00:09:16,064
Especially, you know,
the way you are.

148
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:20,101
The way you are
has nothing to do

149
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:22,805
with the fact
that the work needs work.

150
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,908
Thank you, Coach.
We'll try our best.

151
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,776
There you go.

152
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:45,960
Please, dear,
don't linger in the hallway.

153
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,766
Your coat?

154
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,240
Can I get you something to eat?

155
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:03,677
I think I have some peanuts
and some cheese crackers.

156
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:05,812
No, thank you.

157
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:07,780
Perhaps something to drink?

158
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:10,449
I have bourbon, vodka,

159
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,384
gin, champagne.

160
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:14,353
I shouldn't.
I started on the train.

161
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:17,422
What kind of music do you like?

162
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,558
None for me.

163
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,262
Is the temperature okay?

164
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,900
Yes.

165
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:31,135
Hmm.

166
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,872
It's been known to get hot.

167
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:37,274
I'm fine.

168
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:39,243
That's a pretty shade
of lipstick.

169
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:42,579
Thank you.

170
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:49,186
I'm glad you came.

171
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:10,373
Come with me.

172
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:21,616
DDB managed to get me
on the 50-yard line

173
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:23,118
for the Giants game
last November.

174
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:25,654
If we'd done it,
the Steelers would have won.

175
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:28,722
We'd do anything to make you happy.

176
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:30,858
I'm not unhappy with DDB.

177
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:32,793
No notes.

178
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:35,596
When I presented the numbers
for my division,

179
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,400
Timmy came up to me and said,
"How the hell did you do that?"

180
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,502
So I figured he's in town,

181
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:44,137
why not take him
to the horse's mouth?

182
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,838
The past few years,

183
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,108
I've overseen ketchup
to great success.

184
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,310
But how long before
we're old news?

185
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:53,580
And, hell, when I saw baked beans
have a sales spike like that...

186
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:56,149
Raymond has demanded
our best work.

187
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:58,918
So then the question is
what can we do for you?

188
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:00,519
What can we do for ketchup?

189
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,055
Let me know.

190
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,860
A pleasure to meet you, Timmy.

191
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,296
This isn't an official visit.

192
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,498
I'm just dropping by.

193
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,866
Ken, Don and I have a little beans
housekeeping, if you don't mind.

194
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,570
I'd love to walk you out.

195
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,175
Raymond, we're grateful
for this opportunity

196
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,611
and consider it
quite a vote of confidence.

197
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,481
It is, but I don't want you
to waste your time.

198
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,950
Well, then if nothing else,
we appreciate the introduction.

199
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:35,452
I'm not winking here.

200
00:12:35,487 --> 00:12:37,554
There is to be
no further communication

201
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,523
with Timmy or his division.

202
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,992
I'm sorry, Raymond. Did we
do something to upset you?

203
00:12:42,026 --> 00:12:44,628
You guys are doing
a bang-up job.

204
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,396
And now that polished Polack
wants the same.

205
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:49,265
I'll take that drink.

206
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:53,169
No one's paid attention to me
in nine years at the company.

207
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:55,104
They gave me a suicide mission.

208
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,740
Vinegar, sauces,
and baked beans.

209
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:00,276
And then in my moment
of triumph, he comes up to me

210
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,178
and he didn't say,
"How did you do that?"

211
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,878
He said,
"How did <i>you</i> do <i>that?"</i>

212
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:06,348
<i>Smug bastard.</i>

213
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:07,915
I taught him
everything he knows.

214
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,918
- We understand, Raymond.
- No, forget it.

215
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:13,522
I know ketchup's
the gold standard,

216
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:16,324
but after all we've been through,
I'm sure I don't need to tell you

217
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:19,627
that if you so much as send
him a ham at Christmas,

218
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:23,197
well, I'd rather retire

219
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:25,499
than watch that guy
screw my girlfriend.

220
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:28,802
- Let me walk you out.
- No.

221
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,971
If he lingered at all,

222
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:33,240
I'm gonna pretend I'm on
my way to the men's room.

223
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,245
I'm sorry.
What a waste of time.

224
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,047
I don't know.
We met Timmy.

225
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:43,916
- He's certainly going places.
- Raymond's so weak.

226
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,986
But he brought his business here
when we were barely standing.

227
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,455
It's Heinz Ketchup, Don.

228
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,956
It's the Coca-Cola
of condiments.

229
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:53,792
I know.

230
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:56,595
But sometimes you've got to dance
with the one that brung ya.

231
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,702
I'm afraid that's the end
of your toilet paper.

232
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:06,405
This place could really use
a woman's touch.

233
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,138
You think so?

234
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:10,474
I might come to town Friday.

235
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,710
There's always
a sale at Macy's.

236
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:14,745
We'll see.

237
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:18,482
Okay, I'll call you.

238
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:21,452
If I let the phone ring once and
hang up, then you'll know it's me.

239
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,120
Don't do that.

240
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,889
Well, I'm going to park my car

241
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,425
in front of the driveway
instead of in the driveway.

242
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:30,493
Then you'll know
I'm thinking of you.

243
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,735
That's sweet.

244
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,402
I really have to get back.

245
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:41,403
Can you move it along a little?

246
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:46,597
You told me you were
washing these by hand.

247
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:49,466
- No wonder the elastic is shot.
- I forgot.

248
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,301
And you forgot you left
the vacuum on the terrace.

249
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:52,802
I was changing the bag.

250
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:55,372
And you forgot not to use
S.O.S on the Teflon.

251
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:57,241
I mean, I leave
for work every day

252
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,476
and I wonder what you're
going to ruin in my house.

253
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,246
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Draper.

254
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:08,284
I don't know how to do
this, but you're fired.

255
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:12,021
I'll get my things.

256
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,361
- I'm sorry.
- No.

257
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:21,463
I am. I walked in on it and
then I didn't want to pretend.

258
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,601
Are you okay, honey?

259
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,603
No.

260
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:36,044
Come on.
Let's go upstairs.

261
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,019
I don't wanna go
up until she's gone.

262
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,637
Let her alone
with your silverware?

263
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:44,718
So, after weeks, I finally showed him
the picture of my mother...

264
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:48,755
but that's not enough, because
her name has been changed in the will.

265
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,092
That is quite a story line.

266
00:15:51,126 --> 00:15:53,693
Well, you asked.

267
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:56,563
- It's meaty, isn't it?
- It is.

268
00:15:56,597 --> 00:15:58,431
I just wish watching TV
during the day

269
00:15:58,466 --> 00:16:00,633
didn't make me feel so guilty.

270
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,306
I had a miscarriage.

271
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,408
All right.
I will watch.

272
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:13,945
No, in real life.

273
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:16,094
Two days ago.

274
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:23,489
I'm so sorry to hear that.

275
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:26,124
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
burden you with this.

276
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:28,959
No, you obviously need to talk.

277
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:33,864
I was sloppy
in Hawaii--

278
00:16:35,066 --> 00:16:37,968
the time difference, vacation.

279
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:41,972
Now I feel so guilty.

280
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:44,574
May I?

281
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:49,178
What do you have
to feel guilty about?

282
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,153
What did Don say?

283
00:16:58,522 --> 00:17:01,257
I didn't tell him.

284
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,558
It's been a hard
couple of weeks.

285
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:06,795
Oh.

286
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,665
I don't know why.

287
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:12,701
I mean, I do.

288
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,806
You were raised
the same way I was.

289
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,408
I keep hearing
Sister Eugenie in my head.

290
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,878
I'm such a horrible person.

291
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:29,116
You're not a horrible person.

292
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,485
No, I am.

293
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:35,955
I mean,

294
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,291
to be pregnant now

295
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,326
at this moment?

296
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:43,730
I didn't know
what I wanted to do

297
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:47,067
and I was so relieved that I
didn't have to do anything.

298
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,969
I see.

299
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,605
Has this ever happened to you?

300
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,043
About a year after
I had Mitchell.

301
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,281
So I certainly understand
some of what you're feeling.

302
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,686
But the rest of it,

303
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,421
no.

304
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:11,989
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,325
Really?

306
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,927
Because I was raised
the same way,

307
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,031
so I would never even
consider that my decision.

308
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,466
You really believe that?

309
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,667
I do.

310
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:27,303
And I think you do, too,

311
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:29,106
or you wouldn't feel this way.

312
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,411
I just feel so shitty.

313
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,848
I'm sorry I brought it up.

314
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,422
Hello.

315
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:50,059
Hello.

316
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:53,062
- Sylvia's here.
- I see that.

317
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:55,429
Hello.

318
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:04,739
I should be going.

319
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:08,276
You don't have to rush off.

320
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,678
- <i>Have a drink.</i>
- No, I'll leave you two alone.

321
00:19:17,152 --> 00:19:19,987
- I fired the maid today.
- Good riddance.

322
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:21,889
Good night, both of you.

323
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:23,590
See you tomorrow.

324
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:26,426
- Excuse me?
- For dinner.

325
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,262
Oh, of course.

326
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,496
Yes.

327
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:49,514
So send her in.

328
00:19:49,548 --> 00:19:51,950
Sorry to bother you,
but this was on my desk.

329
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,484
Is it new?

330
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,120
There's usually a memo
for everything around here.

331
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:57,322
- What is it?
- It's Quest.

332
00:19:57,356 --> 00:20:01,192
Feminine hygiene powder.

333
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:03,727
- Did I miss a meeting?
- "Proof points--

334
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:06,931
has baking soda, makes you
nicer if you're stinky,

335
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:09,499
kills overly
critical bacteria."

336
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,239
"Target-- professional
women and other Olsons."

337
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,208
Just give it to me.

338
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:19,810
Calm down.

339
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,545
I think this is somebody's
idea of a joke.

340
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:23,814
Of course, when you want them
to be funny they're useless.

341
00:20:29,654 --> 00:20:31,487
Hello, gorgeous.

342
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:36,826
Hello, Herb.

343
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:40,128
Did you get
all gussied up for me?

344
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:41,831
No.

345
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,467
I had no idea you'd be
darkening my doorway.

346
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:47,435
When are you gonna
come out to the lot?

347
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,505
I told you, I'll let you have a
Jaguar for as long as you like.

348
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,240
I take the bus.

349
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:55,343
I know there's a part of you
that's glad to see me.

350
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:58,780
And I know there's a part of
you you haven't seen in years.

351
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:01,249
Herb!
There you are.

352
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:02,884
How are you today?

353
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,718
Toodle-oo.

354
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:11,592
<i>Mrs. Harris
is here to see you.</i>

355
00:21:11,626 --> 00:21:13,527
He's here.

356
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:37,148
Thank you.

357
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:39,384
- Who are you?
- I'm Bob Benson.

358
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,420
We've met before.
I'm part of the team.

359
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:44,923
Doesn't the elevator
go up to this floor?

360
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:48,026
Herb.

361
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,628
What brings you by?

362
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:52,362
I had some thoughts,
the complexity of which

363
00:21:52,397 --> 00:21:54,197
could not be expressed
over a telephone.

364
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:55,766
What is it you want?

365
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:58,469
Well, you guys are gonna
make some fancy-schmancy

366
00:21:58,503 --> 00:22:00,538
Michelangelo TV spot
and the dealers

367
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:02,272
are gonna foot most of
the bill for running it.

368
00:22:02,307 --> 00:22:04,241
That's how it works.

369
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:07,077
Well, I'm the only guy actually
out there selling hamburgers

370
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:10,313
and I want people to know there's
a hamburger store in Englewood,

371
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:12,782
not England or in your mind.

372
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:16,018
I don't want another thing with some
shmuck sitting on his lawn mower

373
00:22:16,053 --> 00:22:19,556
fantasizing that he's gonna win
the Grand Prix driving a Jaguar.

374
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,357
I need foot traffic.

375
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:23,225
Get 'em in the door
so I can move metal.

376
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,595
Well, you, along with
the factory guys,

377
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:29,264
have already signed off on
the work as well as the buy.

378
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:32,400
I just think there should
be retail radio as well.

379
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:35,737
You know? "Does your
car sound like this?"

380
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,507
Voom voom! "Does your
wife sound like this?"

381
00:22:38,541 --> 00:22:40,107
"Ooh, I love your car."

382
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:42,977
And then you say
the phone number twice.

383
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,612
Wonderful.

384
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:46,881
We'd love to increase
the exposure of the campaign.

385
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:48,516
How much more
would you like to buy?

386
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,487
There's no increase.
Just adjust the proportions.

387
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:54,622
I think we should spend
60% of the money

388
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,791
on local dealership ads
instead of national.

389
00:22:57,825 --> 00:23:01,595
Herb, that would really take a
bite out of the national campaign.

390
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:03,797
Well, if you say so.

391
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:06,199
Unfortunately,
it's not up to me,

392
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:08,334
so I am suggesting

393
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:11,471
that you recommend
this plan to all of us.

394
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:13,772
Why don't you recommend it?
It's your idea.

395
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:17,175
Because it's an idea
you had yourself.

396
00:23:18,778 --> 00:23:21,747
And Lord knows
you're so damn persuasive.

397
00:23:21,781 --> 00:23:24,016
We understand, Herb.

398
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,018
See how easy that was, Bob?

399
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:32,690
Bob, why don't you
show me the sights?

400
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:35,527
You must be like a kid
in a candy store around here.

401
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:43,534
- You can't shake his hand?
- He didn't seem interested.

402
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:46,737
In fact, the only thing he seemed interested
in was gutting our national campaign.

403
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:49,439
You do realize that defeats
the purpose of having Jaguar?

404
00:23:49,473 --> 00:23:51,875
So he's demanding
and unreasonable.

405
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,378
How does that make him different from the
other people who walk through that door?

406
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:58,415
I wish you would handle the clients
as well as you're handling me.

407
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:07,682
<i>Jimmy's Condom Warehouse</i>

408
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,651
<i>where the rubber meets the road.
Jimmy speaking.</i>

409
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:11,952
You want a drink?

410
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:15,122
No, thank you.
I'm quite comfortable.

411
00:24:15,157 --> 00:24:18,326
<i>How was your day, honey?</i>

412
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:20,861
Okay.

413
00:24:20,896 --> 00:24:23,763
Okay?
What happened to Shangri-La?

414
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:25,999
Chaough quit crapping out
snow cones?

415
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:29,169
Everyone hates me here.

416
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:30,804
Well, that was bound to happen.

417
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:34,274
You worked for me
and you like me.

418
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:37,411
- I worked with you.
- I was tough but fair.

419
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:39,245
<i>Oh, speaking of people</i>
<i>who hate you,</i>

420
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,480
<i>Raymond J. Beans came in today</i>
<i>and pulled a real boner.</i>

421
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:43,015
Go on.

422
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,483
He brought in
the head of ketchup.

423
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:46,752
He's obsessed with that man.

424
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,254
Yeah, he should be.
I met him.

425
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,323
So Raymond makes
the introduction

426
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:53,192
and then, according to Ken, ketchup
leaves, but Raymond lingers

427
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:55,527
and he says he's gonna
kill the account and himself

428
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,161
if they even talk
to ketchup again.

429
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,197
Why'd he bring him in?

430
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:02,500
Because he's Raymond.
He's a fraidycat.

431
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,470
And-- here's the part
that's gonna make you happy--

432
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,872
Kenny spent two weeks
telling everybody

433
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,407
how he was getting ketchup.

434
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,080
Okay, Tuesday morning
is perfect.

435
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:19,650
<i>What? Oh, yep.</i>

436
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,018
<i>We'll have your wig</i>
<i>ready then, ma'am.</i>

437
00:25:24,822 --> 00:25:26,857
You're allowed to make
personal calls after 5:00,

438
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:28,424
especially if they
make you laugh.

439
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:30,826
My friend Stan was
telling me a funny story

440
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:33,429
- about one of our old clients.
- What happened?

441
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:37,233
Oh, it's complicated, but basically
the guy from Heinz Baked Beans

442
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:38,801
hates the guy at Heinz Ketchup.

443
00:25:38,835 --> 00:25:40,370
Of course he does.

444
00:25:40,404 --> 00:25:43,305
Well, surprisingly,
beans brought ketchup in

445
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,707
for a meeting at the agency
and everyone got excited,

446
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:49,077
and then unsurprisingly
he sent ketchup out of the room

447
00:25:49,111 --> 00:25:50,679
and told everyone
it was just for show.

448
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:52,781
So he's unhappy?

449
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:55,183
He's not going anywhere.

450
00:25:55,217 --> 00:25:56,885
Probably misses you.

451
00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,553
No.

452
00:25:58,588 --> 00:26:00,488
I assure you, he doesn't.

453
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:06,160
There's nothing like things going
badly when you leave, is there?

454
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,366
Sorry I'm late.

455
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:14,234
3rd Avenue was a parking lot.

456
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:18,438
I'm not feeling well.

457
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,410
That's not where it hurts.

458
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:25,512
Oh.
Did you cancel?

459
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:28,648
No, I thought I'd feel better
by the time you got home.

460
00:26:28,683 --> 00:26:30,850
We're supposed to be there
in 15 minutes.

461
00:26:30,884 --> 00:26:32,418
They're probably already there.

462
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:35,487
I know, but I don't
want to pretend

463
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:38,524
like I'm having a good time
and it's too late to cancel.

464
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,993
- They'll survive.
- I want you to go.

465
00:26:42,028 --> 00:26:44,229
I want you to have fun.

466
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:49,367
Okay.

467
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,101
But you go right to bed.

468
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,137
Yes, sir.

469
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:09,586
<i>Go away!</i>

470
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,488
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

471
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:13,724
What on earth is that?

472
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,226
<i>Somebody, please!</i>

473
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,295
<i>Somebody help!</i>

474
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,634
- Oh, my goodness!
- What happened to you?

475
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:29,638
<i>Hey, Campbell,</i>
<i>she's your problem now.</i>

476
00:27:29,673 --> 00:27:31,940
I'm sorry. I didn't
know where else to go.

477
00:27:31,975 --> 00:27:34,543
- He was chasing me.
- Close the door.

478
00:27:34,578 --> 00:27:36,277
Hold this to your nose.

479
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:37,912
What the hell happened?

480
00:27:37,946 --> 00:27:39,947
I'm so embarrassed.

481
00:27:41,484 --> 00:27:43,451
We had a terrible fight.

482
00:27:43,486 --> 00:27:46,521
- I'm going to call the authorities.
- No, please.

483
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:48,390
Well, then I'm taking you
to the hospital.

484
00:27:48,424 --> 00:27:50,525
- I'll be fine.
- No, what do you think you're doing?

485
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,959
You're not going back there.
Peter, go to Tammy's bathroom.

486
00:27:52,994 --> 00:27:54,828
There's some cotton wool.

487
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:59,032
I'll be right back.

488
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:03,069
I hope you haven't
been waiting long.

489
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:05,071
Oh, don't worry about it.
I was late, too.

490
00:28:05,106 --> 00:28:07,607
They already gave us
a hard time.

491
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:09,842
- Where's your wife? - She sends her
regrets. She wasn't feeling well.

492
00:28:09,877 --> 00:28:12,745
- That's too bad.
- You look lovely.

493
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,014
Let's get you a drink.

494
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:17,750
We'll get the waiter
to do the whole show again.

495
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:20,052
I'm afraid there's only
going to be three of us.

496
00:28:20,086 --> 00:28:21,621
- Don?
- Old-fashioned, please.

497
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:23,088
<i>Subito.</i>

498
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:26,792
Well, the North Koreans
really took that ship.

499
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:29,093
And the Vietcong, did you see
them storming the embassy?

500
00:28:29,128 --> 00:28:30,995
I haven't followed it today.

501
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,997
- We got it back.
- Still...

502
00:28:33,032 --> 00:28:35,300
these two little pissant countries
handing our head to us.

503
00:28:35,334 --> 00:28:37,736
Well, I don't know
about the ship,

504
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:40,438
but from what I've read, the embassy was
an ambush that broke the cease-fire.

505
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:42,973
We gave them peace
for their sacred holiday.

506
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:46,410
Next thing we know,
they cut us to ribbons.

507
00:28:46,445 --> 00:28:47,912
Reminds me of Cuba.

508
00:28:47,946 --> 00:28:50,314
No one took
Fidel Castro seriously.

509
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,282
We thought he was Señor Wences.

510
00:28:52,317 --> 00:28:54,518
Turns out he was
George Washington.

511
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:57,487
And they say surgeons
are arrogant.

512
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:58,988
Who says that?

513
00:28:59,022 --> 00:29:01,458
You know we're losing the war.

514
00:29:03,026 --> 00:29:05,562
Wouldn't know it
from looking around here.

515
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:08,064
Yeah, it's something, right?

516
00:29:08,098 --> 00:29:11,434
- You are Dr. Rosen?
- You see this service?

517
00:29:11,468 --> 00:29:14,002
Yes. We'd like to hear
the spiel again.

518
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:16,839
Uh, <i>scusi.</i>
There is a telephone call.

519
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:18,974
Really?

520
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,976
I'll be right back.

521
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,112
I'm gonna take this as an
opportunity to powder my nose.

522
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:49,636
There's no answer.

523
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,171
Is there anyone else?
Family?

524
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:54,173
My sister's back in Oneonta.

525
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:57,010
My mother's in Boca Raton.

526
00:29:57,044 --> 00:30:00,813
Well, you can't go home.
We should find a hotel.

527
00:30:05,018 --> 00:30:06,351
Let's try some ice.

528
00:30:13,994 --> 00:30:15,793
What did you say to him?

529
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:18,563
Hello? Yes.

530
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:20,164
Do you have any
vacancies this evening?

531
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:22,834
Take me to the city.
I want to be with you.

532
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,503
Absolutely not.

533
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:28,105
Very good.
Thank you.

534
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,542
The Old Greenwich has rooms.

535
00:30:30,576 --> 00:30:33,343
- Can you take me there?
- We'll get you a taxi.

536
00:30:33,377 --> 00:30:35,311
Nonsense.
I'll drive you.

537
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:38,481
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'll run you over.

538
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:41,652
Brenda, dear, let's go.
It's best this way.

539
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:56,234
Emergency averted?

540
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:57,736
Unfortunately, no.

541
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:59,304
Sylvia and you
are having dinner.

542
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:01,439
- This is silly.
- We can do this another time.

543
00:31:01,473 --> 00:31:03,974
I'm not taking my foot out of
the door of this restaurant.

544
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:06,310
Order for four
or they'll punish me.

545
00:31:07,446 --> 00:31:09,414
Good luck.

546
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,687
What are you having?

547
00:31:16,722 --> 00:31:18,755
I don't know
that I'm that hungry.

548
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:23,627
You want another glass of wine?
Should we get a bottle?

549
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:25,662
You're drinking something else.

550
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,964
I don't want you to have wine
if you don't drink wine.

551
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:29,833
I'm not gonna drink
a whole bottle, obviously.

552
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:32,402
I don't know
how obvious that is.

553
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:34,403
Another glass is fine.

554
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:37,573
So what looks good here?

555
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:40,409
Depends what you want.

556
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:43,579
Well, I'm hungry,
I'm in a good mood,

557
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:47,650
and I'd like some guidance on the
Italian menu from my favorite Italian.

558
00:31:47,684 --> 00:31:50,819
I didn't cook it, so I can't
speak to its quality.

559
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:56,591
You think I'd like
eggplant rollatinis?

560
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,760
For the lovely signora?

561
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:00,628
- We're not ready yet.
- Yes, we are.

562
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:02,296
Can she have
another glass of wine

563
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:03,765
and could you give us a minute?

564
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,599
<i>Certo.</i>

565
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:12,205
What's wrong?

566
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:14,441
How could I possibly know
what you like to eat?

567
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,276
I thought you were
looking forward to this.

568
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,278
I don't know what we're doing.

569
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,681
We're having dinner together.

570
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:23,282
And I'm sorry, but I guess
it was a stupid idea to think

571
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,118
we could spend time together
outside of your maid's room.

572
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,288
Just because they cleared
their place settings

573
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,190
doesn't mean we're alone.

574
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:32,825
Is that what's bothering you?

575
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,160
That everything
worked out perfectly?

576
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:37,262
And you enjoy how foolish
they both look.

577
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:41,299
Now I understand.

578
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:47,171
You want to feel shitty

579
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:50,074
right up until the point
where I take your dress off.

580
00:32:55,246 --> 00:32:57,247
Because I'm going to do that.

581
00:32:57,281 --> 00:33:01,051
You want to skip dinner?
Fine. But don't pretend.

582
00:33:01,085 --> 00:33:04,488
<i>"Casta Diva - Norma</i>
<i>1st Act" playing</i>

583
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:11,160
And what if she had come?

584
00:33:11,194 --> 00:33:12,962
The evening would be
just the same,

585
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:14,731
only it would be
someone else's dress?

586
00:33:17,668 --> 00:33:20,036
What are you talking about?

587
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,506
Weren't you the one who told
me you were drifting apart?

588
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:25,541
Isn't that what this was about?

589
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:27,375
I want you.

590
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,346
<i>I want you all the time.</i>

591
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,682
But if you've suddenly decided you
want something more than that,

592
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:35,984
well, then,
that's news, isn't it?

593
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:40,789
So, have you decided?

594
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:45,392
I don't know.
Have you?

595
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,666
He'll have the steak diavolo

596
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,868
and I'll have the branzino.

597
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:55,703
Anything to start?

598
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:58,304
No. We're in a bit of a hurry.

599
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,580
I'm sorry.

600
00:34:06,614 --> 00:34:09,182
I'm so sorry.

601
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:12,018
I have no right to be jealous.

602
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:14,352
This is just us here tonight.

603
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:20,993
We have to be careful.
We can't fall in love.

604
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:23,361
It won't be so French anymore.

605
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,008
Hi, this is Johnny Carson.
As you know,

606
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,410
this is the usual starting time
for "The Tonight Show."

607
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:42,981
<i>And tonight my guest is the New Orleans
district attorney Mr. Jim Garrison,</i>

608
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:44,882
<i>who is with us to discuss,</i>
<i>as he puts it,</i>

609
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:48,151
some new and vital information
concerning the Kennedy assassination.

610
00:34:48,185 --> 00:34:51,554
But because of the critical
war situation in Vietnam,

611
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,791
especially around Saigon,
NBC for the next 15 minutes

612
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:57,861
<i>is going to bring you a special
news program via satellite.</i>

613
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,863
So stay with us.
We'll return in 15 minutes

614
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,931
with our guest
Mr. Garrison.

615
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:30,158
Did you have fun?

616
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:31,993
Arnold had an emergency,

617
00:35:32,028 --> 00:35:33,661
so Sylvia and I
had to eat enough

618
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:36,797
to keep him
in good graces there.

619
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:38,799
Are you feeling better?

620
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,469
I need to talk to you.

621
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:50,409
What's wrong?

622
00:35:50,443 --> 00:35:52,244
Um...

623
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:57,216
Well, I had a miscarriage

624
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,318
a few days ago.

625
00:36:07,326 --> 00:36:09,127
Are you okay?

626
00:36:09,162 --> 00:36:10,862
Did you go to the doctor?

627
00:36:10,897 --> 00:36:12,898
Yes.

628
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:14,866
How far along were you?

629
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:16,534
Six weeks.

630
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,405
I wish you would have told me.

631
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:25,776
I guess I didn't know
how you'd feel.

632
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,644
I didn't know what you'd want.

633
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:33,217
Megan, you have to know
I'd want what you want.

634
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:35,686
Is that what you want?

635
00:36:35,721 --> 00:36:38,621
Of course it is.

636
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,657
But I don't know that it's even

637
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:45,128
the right time to have
a conversation about it.

638
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:47,997
And I guess that's why
I didn't tell you.

639
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,701
But I should have.

640
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:54,002
Yes, you should have.

641
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:59,775
Do you want to have
that conversation?

642
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:02,611
Whatever you want.

643
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,019
Now I can go to sleep.

644
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:20,361
Good morning.

645
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:27,400
- Where's Tammy?
- Leticia took her to the park.

646
00:37:27,434 --> 00:37:29,369
Oh.

647
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:32,472
Well, I'm off.

648
00:37:32,506 --> 00:37:35,441
Couldn't you just pretend?

649
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:39,880
I let you have that apartment.

650
00:37:39,914 --> 00:37:43,015
Somehow I thought
that there was some dignity

651
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:45,117
in granting permission.

652
00:37:45,152 --> 00:37:48,387
All I wanted was
for you to be discreet.

653
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:49,922
She lives on our block!

654
00:37:49,956 --> 00:37:52,324
Trudy, don't jump
to conclusions.

655
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:54,760
There's no way
for me to escape.

656
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,962
To not be an object of pity

657
00:37:56,997 --> 00:37:59,397
while you get to do
whatever you feel like.

658
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:01,232
I have never said no to you.

659
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:04,068
That is not true.
What are we doing out here?

660
00:38:05,404 --> 00:38:07,438
We're done, Peter.
This is over.

661
00:38:07,472 --> 00:38:09,107
You want a divorce?

662
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:11,342
I refuse to be a failure.

663
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,278
I don't care
what you want anymore.

664
00:38:13,312 --> 00:38:15,045
This is how it's going to work.

665
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,615
You will be here only when
I tell you to be here.

666
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:20,818
I'm drawing a 50-mile
radius around this house

667
00:38:20,852 --> 00:38:24,788
and if you so much as open your fly
to urinate, I will destroy you.

668
00:38:24,822 --> 00:38:26,756
Do you understand?

669
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:30,059
You know what?

670
00:38:30,093 --> 00:38:32,261
You're going to go
to bed alone tonight

671
00:38:32,296 --> 00:38:35,398
and you're going to realize you
don't know anything for sure.

672
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:38,166
I'll live with that.

673
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,147
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

674
00:38:52,181 --> 00:38:54,248
So far this is all we have,

675
00:38:54,282 --> 00:38:56,884
but I want you to find out
everything you can on Heinz Ketchup.

676
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,686
What?

677
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:00,588
And this is not a joke.

678
00:39:03,992 --> 00:39:06,026
No.
I can't do that.

679
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:07,228
Why not?

680
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,196
It's a little bit of a secret,

681
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:10,797
but it turns out
they're taking meetings.

682
00:39:10,832 --> 00:39:13,166
I told you that secret
and I shouldn't have.

683
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,935
Look, everybody's gonna know.
We just know a little sooner.

684
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,538
My friend told me that
in confidence.

685
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:20,306
He's not your friend.

686
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:22,242
- He's the enemy.
- Well, he doesn't know that.

687
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,111
Maybe you need a friend
more than you need a job.

688
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:26,912
I didn't know that.
I'm in advertising.

689
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,914
It's not that.

690
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:31,149
It's just that it was
a private conversation.

691
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:34,219
What are you, his priest?
This is how wars are won.

692
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,822
Your friend's mistake
was underestimating you.

693
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:43,728
I hope ketchup makes the same
mistake so you can blow their mind.

694
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,144
<i>So, correct me</i>
<i>if I'm wrong, Pete.</i>

695
00:39:53,178 --> 00:39:54,846
I certainly will.

696
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,614
You're suggesting
that we forego

697
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:58,682
this sparkling
national ad campaign

698
00:39:58,716 --> 00:40:02,719
in favor of hard-driving sales
ads at the local dealer level?

699
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:05,622
Not exactly. We will still
have a national presence

700
00:40:05,657 --> 00:40:08,358
with the sophisticated work that
Don presented and you loved,

701
00:40:08,392 --> 00:40:11,929
but we will increase
sales with a surgical

702
00:40:11,963 --> 00:40:14,764
and financial focus
on local media.

703
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:17,567
Well, that sounds good to me. Of
course, I'm a little bit biased.

704
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:19,569
Why would we do that?

705
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:23,072
We feel it's best to have a
plan that creates customers,

706
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:24,707
not just aficionados.

707
00:40:24,741 --> 00:40:27,944
Don, are you really in favor

708
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:29,579
of throwing
our emphasis into radio?

709
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:31,813
Well, it's hard to argue

710
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:34,048
with a more direct appeal
to customers.

711
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,250
I mean, we can artsy up
the image of Jaguar,

712
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:40,455
make it look romantic
and stylish,

713
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:43,124
but isn't it better
to tell people

714
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,093
who are actually
in the market for a car

715
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:46,927
that a Jaguar is available?

716
00:40:49,097 --> 00:40:51,231
I think
it's an exciting new angle

717
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:53,433
to use direct sales
on a luxury vehicle.

718
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:55,903
I mean, forget about radio.

719
00:40:55,937 --> 00:40:57,905
How about a mailer

720
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,640
or a circular
in the Sunday paper?

721
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:02,509
I don't know if that's
what we had in mind.

722
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,812
So this is your recommendation?

723
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:08,948
I think it's better to

724
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:11,450
think about someone
in New Jersey

725
00:41:11,485 --> 00:41:13,452
driving in their current car

726
00:41:13,487 --> 00:41:15,354
and hearing that
right around the corner

727
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,224
there's a Jaguar to buy
at a low, low price.

728
00:41:20,026 --> 00:41:21,927
I bet the numbers would support
that don't they, Harry?

729
00:41:21,961 --> 00:41:24,596
That...

730
00:41:24,631 --> 00:41:26,698
is really a statistics game.

731
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:28,967
You know what?
I will have to double-check.

732
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:31,269
Look, why are you
limiting yourself?

733
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:33,271
Wouldn't you rather
cast a wide net

734
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:36,507
so you can sell Jaguar
to the average guy?

735
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,510
You know, truck drivers,
housewives.

736
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:42,013
<i>I was under the impression
from the work you showed us</i>

737
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:44,214
<i>that this would be</i>
<i>a more elegant approach</i>

738
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:48,019
that made the Jaguar seem rare
because, let's face it,

739
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:52,022
the gentleman who buys our car
needs to be of some means.

740
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:55,324
I am 100% positive

741
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,661
that this approach moves cars.

742
00:41:57,695 --> 00:42:00,830
And not just Jaguars. This is
proven to move all kinds of cars.

743
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:02,999
Hell, even used cars.
Am I wrong, Herb?

744
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:06,335
No, he's right.
It moves cars.

745
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:10,372
Gentlemen, we appreciate
the recommendation,

746
00:42:10,406 --> 00:42:12,908
but we believe we should
stay with the proposal

747
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:14,376
<i>as first discussed.</i>

748
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,745
And as persuasive
as these arguments were,

749
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,049
that is how we will
continue to proceed.

750
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:22,817
Let's not be too hasty.
Maybe we should listen to them.

751
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:24,852
At least give it some thought.

752
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:26,688
Herb's right.

753
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:29,824
We still believe this is our
best chance for success.

754
00:42:29,858 --> 00:42:31,893
Fellas, this is gonna work.

755
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:35,029
I'm sorry, but this is
our final decision.

756
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:37,065
Thank you very much.

757
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:53,714
What the hell was that?

758
00:42:53,748 --> 00:42:55,715
Herb, we couldn't
have pushed any harder.

759
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:58,084
You pushed,
then you let Don talk.

760
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,286
You should know better.
The guy's not a salesman.

761
00:43:02,022 --> 00:43:05,125
That was the deftest
self-immolation I've ever seen.

762
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:06,826
I don't know what
you're talking about.

763
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,794
I didn't know you were
capable of being that bad.

764
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:11,597
- What was that in there?
- I wasn't feeling well.

765
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,465
Something about that guy
makes me sick.

766
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,335
Don't be cute. I still
have his spit in my hair.

767
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:18,137
Why can't you
just follow the rules?

768
00:43:18,171 --> 00:43:20,139
I did. I did exactly
what he asked for.

769
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:22,974
Not in spirit. You know damn
well that is not what he wanted.

770
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:24,309
Why do we care
what that guy wants?

771
00:43:24,344 --> 00:43:26,478
- Because he's a client.
- Our client.

772
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:29,447
And so we just keep
saying yes no matter what

773
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,449
because we didn't say no
to begin with?

774
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,117
You know what this is?
It's Munich.

775
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,619
You guys are always
talking about Munich.

776
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,387
What the hell
does that mean anyway?

777
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:38,222
It means we gave the Germans
whatever they wanted

778
00:43:38,257 --> 00:43:40,658
to make them happy, but it
just made them want more.

779
00:43:40,692 --> 00:43:42,660
Well, who the hell won the war?

780
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,535
As my mother used to say,

781
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:54,037
your options were
dishonor or war.

782
00:43:54,071 --> 00:43:56,306
You chose dishonor,
you might still get war.

783
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,574
That was Churchill.

784
00:44:04,747 --> 00:44:06,414
First one in, last one out.

785
00:44:06,448 --> 00:44:07,848
I don't know how you do it.

786
00:44:07,883 --> 00:44:10,351
Me either.

787
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:13,854
Well, it can't be that bad when
you're doing something that you love.

788
00:44:13,889 --> 00:44:16,291
I'm glad it looks
like that to you.

789
00:44:19,195 --> 00:44:22,829
I spent a year in finance

790
00:44:22,863 --> 00:44:26,166
watching identical men

sneak drinks out
of a desk drawer

792
00:44:27,935 --> 00:44:29,436
while counting
other people's money.

793
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:31,071
What house?

794
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:33,707
My family's been at
Brown Brothers Harriman

795
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:36,076
for three generations.

796
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:38,377
You make this
look a lot better.

797
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:41,347
It's all about what it
looks like, isn't it?

798
00:44:41,381 --> 00:44:43,782
I'm going down to the deli.

799
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,284
Can I get you something?

800
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:47,220
No, thank you.

801
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:50,690
Bob.

802
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:53,259
My wife asked me
and I seem to have forgotten.

803
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:56,261
Could you pick me up
some toilet paper?

804
00:44:56,295 --> 00:44:58,129
I got it, chief.

805
00:45:11,243 --> 00:45:13,277
Good evening.

806
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:16,813
He's home. You can't knock
on the door like that.

807
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:19,816
I was taking the trash out
and you left it open.

808
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,452
Tomorrow morning.

809

00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:54,616
I dropped a penny.

812
