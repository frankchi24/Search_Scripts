1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,100
Mad Men


2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Season 2

3
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:44,000
Ep 11

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,900
1

5
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,000
I lay on my pillow
at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.

6
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,900
Delicious and destroyed.

7
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,800
Inhaling the fragrance
of the sheets.

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,500
Feeling the warmth of where
you were just laying.

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,000
You make me new
with laughter.

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,800
You make me old
with wisdom.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
You make wine taste sweeter.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who wrote that?

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,200
I write a lot of poetry
when I'm inspired.

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,800
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised by anything you do.

15
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,400
You shouldn't.

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,900
It's insulting.

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,800
I have to keep you in line,
or I'll lose you.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,500
Yes, you will.

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,100
I don't like the idea
of making you older.

20
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,200
I just meant...

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,800
I don't know.

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,700
It doesn't matter
how old I am.

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,200
Our souls are the same age.

24
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,300
Oh, God.

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,600
You're getting to me.

26
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,200
How do I know I'm not just
going to eat another mushroom and 

27
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,100
this room will disappear
and I'll be back on a train to Trenton?

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,000
and this room will disappear
and I'll be back on a train to Trenton?

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Because I love you, Jane.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,500
This is hard for you.
I know it.

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,600
You don't want me
to talk about it, but... 

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,300
Margaret and Mona have been in
your life for the last 40 years.

33
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,000
30.

34
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Listen,
I'm not being impulsive,

35
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,000
because I've been thinking
about this all the time.

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,100
I want you to be my wife.

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,300
What?

38
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,300
Marry me.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,100
Roger, are you serious?

40
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,600
Will you do that for me?

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,300
90% of Right Guard users
say they play sports.

42
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,800
60% wear it
for their girls as well.

43
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Most impressive, 80% of the fellas
saying yes to the question

44
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,000
"Does Right Guard make you
feel more confident at work?"

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,900
Did anyone watch
Loretta Young last night?

46
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,400
I was supposed to.
What happened?

47
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,100
I can't even describe it,
it was so awful.

48
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,500
Creative, you think
old Donny Draper will mind

49
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,100
if we think better
on a full stomach?

50
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,500
Well, if you'll all swear
Gillette dropped in.

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,700
- Are you kidding?
- Absolutely.

52
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,300
I'll pretend they're here
if you give me some actual ideas.

53
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,000
Right Guard already
has a great campaign...

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,300
"men being men."

55
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,800
You know, women
smell bad, too.

56
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,400
Not you, of course.

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,700
Women have perfume.

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,300
"Perfume does not
fight wetness. "

59
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,000
Loretta Young.
She's my dad's favorite.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The aprons.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,600
The nauseating upholstery
on the couch.

62
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,800
Strangers who drop by.

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,300
- Hear from Kinsey?
- What do you mean?

64
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,800
Did you read what's
going on down there?

65
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,300
In this day and age.

66
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,700
The papers said it's going to
be Little Rock all over again.

67
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,900
I don't know why people
keep stirring up trouble.

68
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,300
It's bad for business.

69
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,100
Just another reason
not to watch TV.

70
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,500
Kurt doesn't
even have one.

71
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,200
You have to have one.
It's your job.

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
You're going to miss
the playoff.

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,400
It's a different life
for single men.

74
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,000
What do you do
with your spare time?

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
I like concerts.
I like park.

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
He saw Bob Dylan
at Carnegie Hall.

77
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
I heard him on the radio.

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,300
So we're not going
to work at all.

79
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,700
Tell Right Guard, short of
a new product just for women,

80
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,500
we need more research
and time.

81
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,800
And lunch.

82
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,200
Can we split a lobster?

83
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,400
Does he sound
like the album?

84
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,000
When you hear him,

he plays it himself.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,900
It must be
something to see.

86
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,900
I'd love to go sometime.

87
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,200
- So go.
- Yes, I should.

88
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,100
You will go with me.

89
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,900
- What?
- You would go with me?

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,200
Oh, no. I... I don't want
to impose if you have plans.

91
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,300
When you hear him,
you will smile like this.

92
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,200
Pick you up at 8.

93
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,400
I live in Brooklyn.
It's a hike.

94
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,900
Neighbors.

95
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,000
Joey says that Duck's
in the blind.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,300
It's now or never.

97
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
This is why I booked
a day early.

98
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,200
What did Ricardo
in there say?

99
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,500
He's an hourly contact
with TWA,

100
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,400
and they've offered
to buy you new luggage.

101
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
And fill it
with my things?

102
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,700
Ricardo recommended
a tailor.

103
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,900
Chinese.

104
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,100
And they said they've got
a whole shop full of swim trunks.

105
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,000
I brought mine.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
There's not going
to be any swimming.

107
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,100
The convention doesn't
start for another day.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,400
You want to be the hundredth person to
shake someone's hand at some convention?

109
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,900
For what, a free pen?

110
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,700
We'll follow-up
face to face.

111
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,800
Forget Santa Monica.

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,900
Take your list,target some of these guys,
and make them feel special.

113
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,900
Didn't Roger
give you leads?

114
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
He did.

115
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm going to need
sunglasses.

116
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,700
Come on.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,500
You wanna be on vacation, Pete?
'Cause I can make that happen.

118
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,700
Old-fashioned.

119
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,500
Excuse me.

120
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,500
My friends and I have
been speculating about you,

121
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,500
trying to decide
who you are and what you do.

122
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,200
- Why?
- Are you an actor?

123
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,300
- No.
- Are you an astronaut?

124
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,600
No.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
Someone over there
would like to meet you...

126
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
a young woman...

127
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,600
only if you were
none of these things.

128
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,100
I'm Vicompte Monteforte
d'Alsace.

129
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,000
- Willy.
- Don.

130
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,300
This is Don.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,900
She's been staring
at you all day.

132
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Can't stop talking
about you.

133
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm Joy.

134
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,400
Oh, and this is Rocci.

135
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,900
You look so comfortable
alone by the pool all day.

136
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,400
I wonder if you're
waiting for someone.

137
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I am.

138
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,600
Do you smell that jasmine?

139
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Mmm. 

140
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,900
Dine with us.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
Maybe another time.

142
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Well. That never happens.

143
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Hello.

144
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,800
Pete, this is Joy and Rocci
and Vicompte Monteforte.

145
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,900
Very good.

146
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,900
D'Alsace. Willy.

147
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,500
That's quite a name.

148
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,100
Peter Dykeman Campbell.

149
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,200
Have we met somewhere?
Newport?

150
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,900
I have a terrible memory
for faces.

151
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,200
- Nice meeting you.
- Yes.

152
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,300
A pleasure to meet you.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,300
Look for us.

154
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,100
Everybody here
is late for everything.

155
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,700
Oh. I just saw Tony Curtis
in the men's room.

156
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Handing out towels?

157
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,400
Tony Curtis, Don.

158
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,000
A thing like that.

159
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,900
Who's for dinner?

160
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,100
Rodney Barnes.
Classic salesman turned executive.

161
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,300
And this interesting
scientist, Caleb Sawyer.

162
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,300
He has this "optiman" thesis.

163
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,900
In addition to rockets,
they're going to start engineering man...

164
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,000
you know,
for travel in space.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,900
Uh, new organs,
super strength.

166
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,100
You know the Soviets
are working on it.

167
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,900
Are all of our meetings
like this?

168
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,800
It's American Aviation
and Rocketdyne.

169
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,100
It's not a joke.

170
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Can I get a drink here
or what?

171
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,800
Raphael was a little tired.

172
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,000
But the Fifth Arrondissement
has most of your good restaurants.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Of course, we kept getting lost,

174
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,900
and every time Sherry asked for directions,
it turned out to be another American.

175
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, there you go. I'll take Jane
to Paris, and I'll send Mona to Reno.

176
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,700
You don't have to
marry her, do you?

177
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,400
No.

178
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,100
Maybe you and Mona could work out
one of those modern arrangements.

179
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,600
George, stop.

180
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,800
It is possible
that you'll get tired of her,

181
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,700
and then where will you be?

182
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,600
Mona doesn't have
a right to anything...

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,900
not my company money,
not my family money.

184
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,900
She's lucky
I'm giving her anything.

185
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,400
You know what? We've been
miserable for years.

186
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
I don't want to die
with that woman.

187
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,600
Calm down.

188
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
I didn't know that.

189
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,300
This is the life I was
always meant to have.

190
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,800
Congratulations.

191
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,100
Mona has the marriage license,
and she was to hurt you.

192
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,800
If you want to be with
this 20-year-old girl,

193
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,200
you're going to have
to buy it from her.

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,300
And I have to warn you.

195
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Women in this situation
become extra irrational.

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,900
Well, how badly
does she want to hurt me?

197
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,400
I have a list of conditions

198
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,700
and an alimony that could
support Rita Hayworth.

199
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,700
Think of all the good things
in life and cut them in half.

200
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,400
I want you to push
as hard as you can,

201
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,500
but I want it done.

202
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,000
- Mr. Phillips is here.
- In a minute.

203
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,400
I'll proceed.

204
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,200
But I want you
to think about it.

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,100
Duck Phillips,
this is George Rothman.

206
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,600
Actually,
we know each other.

207
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Roger.

208
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,100
It's good to see you, Duck.

209
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,100
Was he for you or against you?

210
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,500
He's supposed to be the best.

211
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,700
Him or Marvin Hughes.

212
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,900
That's who Mona has.

213
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,800
He's her cousin.

214
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,800
How bad was it?
Do I want to know?

215
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
I don't think my circumstances
were the same as yours.

216
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,700
What can I do for you?

217
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,100
Actually, this might not be
the best time to talk about this.

218
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,200
Can't you tell I'd welcome
a change in subject?

219
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,700
Well, good, then.

220
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,900
What the hell, right?

221
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Listen, we're coming up
on two years together here.

222
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,500
Did you get me something?

223
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,200
I think we're
at a point in time...

224
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
where I need to know
what your plans are.

225
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,600
A partnership.
I think I've earned it.

226
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Right.

227
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
I'll bring it up at the next
meeting of the partners.

228
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,900
Thank you.

229
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Of course you might have to come in
and be an advocate for yourself.

230
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
I'd be proud to present
my accomplishments.

231
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,800
Good.
Because I'm at a loss.

232
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,300
What is that
supposed to mean?

233
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,700
You haven't exactly delivered
on that 30% you promised.

234
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,600
I think we've really performed
in a very dismal year.

235
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,700
These things are cyclical.
You know that.

236
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,500
Is there some question about
my value to Sterling Cooper?

237
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,000
Just think about the board.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Bert Cooper hates everyone,

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,700
and his sister...
well, she does whatever he says.

240
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,600
Don... he's only 12 1/2%, but...

241
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,200
I can't say he's
your biggest cheerleader.

242
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,400
What are you saying?

243
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Everyone thinks
you're a fine fellow.

244
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600
But if I were you,

245
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,200
I'd go out there
and make rain.

246
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,600
Thank you
for being so candid.

247
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,800
This year we have seen an historic
collaboration in American aerospace.

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,400
Building on Lockheed's
new Polaris A3,

249
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,500
Bell Aerosystems,
Areojet General, and NASA

250
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,900
have developed
a restartable rocket engine.

251
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,300
Can we get the lights, please?

252
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,000
We at Space Technology
Laboratories

253
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,800
have set our minds to
the challenges of the future.

254
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,200
In July, Khrushchev said
the Soviet Union now has an anti-missile

255
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,400
that can hit a fly
in outer space.

256
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,700
Space Technology Laboratories

257
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,700
is leading a coordinated effort
to create an invulnerable warhead...

258
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,600
multiple, independently targetable
re-entry vehicles - M.I.R.V.s.

259
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,700
And North American
Aviation's vernier thruster

260
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,500
allows the primary missile
to correct its trajectory

261
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,000
before shooting off several warheads
hidden inside its nose cone.

262
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,300
The M.I.R.V. can be launched from
a submarine or land into the stratosphere.

263
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,500
Then it splits off
into 14 individual warheads.

264
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,300
That's 14 different targets.

265
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,300
14 different cities.

266
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,600
14 individual warheads, each with
ten times the payload of Nagasaki.

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Even if Khrushchev hits 35%,
that's 5 out of 14.

268
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,800
Secondary strike capabilities
will be extremely limited...

269
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,900
...due to the decrease
in infrastructure and population.

270
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,300
(U.S.S.R.
Moscow)

271
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,000
Total annihilation.

272
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you realize that one of these
companies spends more annually on media

273
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,400
than three Lucky Strikes?
It's a gold rush.

274
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,300
Where are the valets?

275
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,800
So much for cheap labor.

276
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,700
Go see if General Dynamics
beat us here.

277
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,300
Drop these
by the front desk.

278
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,900
You don't want them
under your arm.

279
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Hello.

280
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,200
I think you're happy
to see me.

281
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, take a good look.
I have to be on my way.

282
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Are you working?

283
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,200
Yes.

284
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,200
That's too bad.

285
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm going to Palm Springs.

286
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,800
You should come with me.

287
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,600
I don't know about that.

288
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,200
Why would you deny yourself
something you want?

289
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,800
You want to get
your things?

290
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,300
No.

291
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well. Why don't we give it
a few more minutes?

292
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,400
Enjoy the scenery.

293
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,400
Order some drinks.

294
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
I think Don needed
to make a phone call.

295
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Hello?

296
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,700
Just leave the bags there.

297
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,600
Who lives here?

298
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,700
Friends.
They're in Sardinia.

299
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,400
I'm supposed to be
in Edward's room.

300
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,600
That's Stephanie
in the swimming pool.

301
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,800
And Willy and Rocci you've met.

302
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,300
And there's Greta
and her friend Carlos.

303
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,500
I'm surprised to see them
in the same place.

304
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,800
Come with me.

305
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,800
Hello, Greta.

306
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,900
Hello, Joy, darling.

307
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,500
Who's this?

308
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,300
This is my friend Don.

309
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm Carlos Villa Declan.

310
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,900
It's medicinal.

311
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,200
importante?

312
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,400
Good-bye, Carlos.

313
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,800
Come for a swim with me?

314
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,100
You can go inside and ask for
some trunks, or you can go au naturel.

315
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,800
I think I should...
go inside.

316
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,500
You're white as a sheet.

317
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,100
Don, are you okay?

318
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,200
Where am I?

319
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,200
You're with me, remember?

320
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,700
You have heat exhaustion.

321
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,500
- What are you doing?
- It's fine. It's medicine.

322
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,100
Klaus is a doctor.

323
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,100
No. It's okay.

324
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,500
I just need some water
and some aspirin.

325
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,800
Everybody out.

326
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,000
I thought you were
going to break your neck.

327
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,100
Next time you feel faint,
lean towards the pool.

328
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,300
See you at dinner.

329
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,400
Little girl,
don't get any ideas.

330
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,200
This man needs rest.

331
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,400
I found you
some clothes upstairs.

332
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,700
Who are these people?

333
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,200
They're friends.

334
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,600
We're nomads together.

335
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,400
What are you all doing here?

336
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,600
There's an open door policy.

337
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,200
You should rest up
for dinner.

338
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,800
Have you ever
had Mexican food?

339
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,000
No.

340
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
You're going to like it.

341
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
Come out when you're ready.

342
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,500
You're spoiled.
This is great food.

343
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,400
This is Mexican.

344
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,800
- It's not...
- I don't like Mexican.

345
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
- I wanted the French again.
- We are in Califor... 

346
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,600
- Sweetheart.
- Mexican does pig. I don't eat pig.

347
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,800
I've already told you.

348
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Okay, well.

349
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,300
Oh, he's here.

350
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,900
Oh. Ah! Don!

351
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,400
Klaus, will you
let Don sit here?

352
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,900
Would you like
some wine, Don?

353
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,600
Klaus, is that okay?

354
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,700
Hmm, he looks
healthy enough.

355
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,800
You must be hungry.

356
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,800
Everyone,
to our guest.

357
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,400
To not being
carried out in a box.

358
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,000
So, Don,
what's your story?

359
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,200
I don't know how
to answer that.

360
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Where are you from?

361
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,200
New York.

362
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,600
Try this. It's a pepper
filled with cheese.

363
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,300
- Darling.
- And there's the sauce.

364
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,400
Joy and Willy think
that you're a spy.

365
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,900
But your wallet fell out
when they carried you inside.

366
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,700
You're in advertising.

367
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,400
Or I'm a really good spy.

368
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,400
You'll never meet a group of people
more interested in professions,

369
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,200
and yet there is not
one of us here who has one.

370
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,500
I'm a physician.

371
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,600
But you don't work.

372
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
So I assume
you're all well off.

373
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,700
I should take something up.

374
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,900
I'm smarter than I've
ever been in my life.

375
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,200
Not only do I know so much,
but my brain is more agile.

376
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,800
I didn't know
that was possible.

377
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,100
And my muscles are
remembering their skills.

378
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,800
Are you an athlete, Don?

379
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,800
I've played some football
in high school.

380
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,000
Willy was
a champion fencer.

381
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,500
I made the Olympic team twice.

382
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,400
1948 London,
1952 Helsinki.

383
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Foils.

384
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,500
It's hardly a sport.

385
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,600
Let's play places.

386
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,900
I start.

387
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,100
You have to name a place

388
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,600
that starts with the last letter
of the place that's named.

389
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,900
Guarnavaca.

390
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Alaska.

391
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,000
It's not a city.

392
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,900
Amalfi.

393
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,000
Ir

394
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,500
Naples.

395
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,200
- Stockholm.
- Malaga.

396
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,700
Athens.

397
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,600
Sarajevo.

398
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,300
Oslo.

399
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,300
O is impossible.

400
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,200
Odessa.

401
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,000
Orezzo.

402
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,300
Osaka.

403
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Oakland.

404
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,600
Dunkirk.

405
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,700
Kabul.

406
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,600
London.

407
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,100
- Nice.
- Essen.

408
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Nairobi.

409
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,600
Itanbul.

410
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,200
Lisbon.

411
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,300
Negril.

412
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Lausanne.

413
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,100
How old are you?

414
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,800
I'm 21.
How old are you?

415
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,300
I'm 36.

416
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,200
You're still warm.

417
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,300
Who are you?

418
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm Joy.

419
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
There's glazed.

420
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,900
Coconut, crullers.

421
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,200
Oh, Bismarcks.

422
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,600
Who brought these
in, Cosgrove?

423
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,300
I haven't seen contracts,
but this is certainly a good sign.

424
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
Gosh, Joan,
thank him for me.

425
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,500
We're going to be getting
a delivery like this every week,

426
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,600
with all the varieties.

427
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,700
Hmm, Lemonaires.

428
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,600
Are these for us?

429
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,400
The spoils of victory.

430
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,300
8:00 in this evening.

431
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,800
- Excuse me?
- Our destination.

432
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,900
Oh. Okay.

433
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,400
- Where are you two going?
- To the Bob Dylan.

434
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,600
Isn't that interesting?

435
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,100
Peggy and Kurt

in the Village, oh, my.

436
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,600
Oh, don't be shy.

437
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,700
I think you two
are adorable.

438
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,700
What is with this?

439
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,000
- You think Peggy and I?
- We do.

440
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,700
I'm homosexual.

441
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,200
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

442
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Kurt.

443
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,400
No. I make love
with the man,

444
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,500
not the woman.

445
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,500
What?

446
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,700
Eight?

447
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,600
Of course. Absolutely.

448
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,900
Enjoy the dancing beans.

449
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,600
Did you know about this?

450
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
He's from Europe.
It's different there.

451
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
More for me.

452
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,600
So Kurt is a pervert.

453
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,100
How about that?

454
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,200
He certainly
had me fooled.

455
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,200
Mr. Cosgrove, do you want me
to invite the girls in?

456
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,200
I knew queers existed.

457
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,500
I just don't want
to work with them.

458
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,500
What, he's the first homo
you ever met in advertising?

459
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,300
You think Smitty's in love?

460
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,800
Which bathroom does he use?

461
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,500
Joan, get the girls in here.

462
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,900
What are you reading?

463
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,800
William Faulkner.

464
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,800
I took a survey
of American literature.

465
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,700
So you're in school?

466
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,700
I was at Pembroke.

467
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,600
Willy has a house in Rhode Island,
so it seemed convenient.

468
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,100
Didn't fit.

469
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Is it good?

470
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,800
Sex is good.

471
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,400
This book is just okay.

472
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,200
I like sex.

473
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
You do, too,
I can tell.

474
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,900
Greta and Carlos
are arguing.

475
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,700
I knew they had problems.

476
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,800
Greta has.

477
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,600
Carlos never had any.

478
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
Good morning.

479
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,800
Good morning.

480
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,300
Do you hear them
in there?

481
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,300
Oh, the humiliations
have been spectacular.

482
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,300
Christien is coming with the children.
I hope you don't mind.

483
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,400
No matter how late I show up,
I'm never later than Christien.

484
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,600
Look at him.

485
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,100
You are so beautiful.

486
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,600
Papa, ne touche pas.

487
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,600
You are a brat.

488
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,500
She has her mother's
temperament.

489
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,200
That's why you love me.

490
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,600
I make beautiful
babies, don't I?

491
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,800
I'll see you outside.

492
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,700
That's your father?

493
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,300
He doesn't want people
to think he's old.

494
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,100
Yes, it's Peter Campbell from
Sterling Cooper for Clarence Hastings.

495
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,600
Is there any way
we can meet here?

496
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
I can't drive, and there doesn't seem
to be a taxi


497
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,200
that will take me
to Pasadena.

498
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,400
We can meet by the pool.

499
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,700
Thank you.
How are you two today?

500
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,200
Duck Phillips.

501
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,100
St. John Powell, how are you?

502
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,700
Capital, capital.

503
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,200
This is Alec Barton.

504
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,500
Duck Phillips.

505
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,300
By Jove, man,
catch up.

506
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,200
I have a bit of a cold.

507
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,400
Well, it's warm already.

508
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,600
It'll open up the passages.

509
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,700
Oh, it's warm or he would have drunk it.

510
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,800
So, how are you
finding New York?

511
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
Brief.

512
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,800
We're going to visit
a candy plant, the Cadbury.

513
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,300
Then it's fate
that I caught you here.

514
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,700
You say fate.

515
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,900
I say another round, gar

516
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,200
Have mine.

517
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,500
If y're not drinking,
what's this about?

518
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,100
I keep thinking how I miss
doing things your way.

519
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,900
Two years ago, you said you wanted
to come here and be with your children.

520
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,600
They're grown.

521
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,500
It's not a good time.

522
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,300
I'm not going to take "no"
for an answer.

523
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,900
I wouldn't expect you to.

524
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,100
You know, if we were hiring,
you would be at the top of our list.

525
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,800
That's too bad.

526
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,100
I love you New York ad men.

527
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,800
To our noble profession.

528
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,300
Cin-cin.

529
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,900
How old are your children?

530
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,800
Alec's wife is about
to have their first.

531
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,000
Do you think that I have
nothing to offer you?

532
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,700
No, of course not.

533
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,000
You represent
over 20 American companies,

534
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,700
doing business in Europe.

535
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,000
I know you want
a U.S. presence.

536
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,200
You're wasting your time doing things
like digging around here for Cadbury.

537
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,400
And you could make
a difference?

538
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,400
What if I were to bring you
every account at Sterling Cooper?

539
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,800
Fully serviced
and completely satisfied?

540
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,300
What are you
talking about?

541
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,700
I'm suggesting that you
buy Sterling Cooper.

542
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,200
There are very few client conflicts.
All you have to do is change the welcome mat.

543
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,000
I didn't know
it was for sale.

544
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,200
Roger Sterling has
a 20-year-old fianc¨¦

545
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,800
and his wife's lawyer's not going
to leave him a pot to piss in.

546
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,800
Alec, would you excuse us?

547
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,200
Did he send you here
with a price?

548
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,300
Send me here?

549
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,400
51% will cost you
a lot less than you think,

550
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,600
plus a finder's fee.

551
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,800
2%.

552
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
I want to be in charge
of all international business,

553
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,300
and I have to be president.

554
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,100
Creative reports to me,
or the whole thing falls apart.

555
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,700
Thank you for thinking of us.

556
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,500
To old friends.

557
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Hello.

558
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800
Did you have
any trouble finding me?

559
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,600
- Neighbors.
- Right.

560
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,700
Would you like some wine?

561
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,900
Very much.

562
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,000
Listen, in the office,
I hope you weren't embarrassed.

563
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,200
No. It's okay.
It's good.

564
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,600
Well, if you have a man that you'd
like to go to the concert with tonight,

565
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,500
I completely understand.

566
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,800
Are you not
on the trip tonight?

567
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,800
I don't know why I pick
the wrong boys.

568
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,400
You're drinking sad.

569
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,400
I don't know.

570
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,600
What's wrong with me?

571
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,300
You are old style.

572
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,400
No, I'm not.

573
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,300
This is not modern office,
a working woman.

574
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,500
What are you talking about?

575
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,500
I fix you.

576
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,500
We should leave.

577
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Each time, Bob Dylan is late.
He will not miss us a half hour.

578
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,800
Sit.

579
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,900
Look at me.
I'm very good.

580
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,900
- Just a trim.
- Yes. Yes.

581
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
- For you.
- Oh, my God.

582
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
It's OK. 
It's good.

583
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
We're headed
to Lyford Cay, Nassau.

584
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,300
Why?

585
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,200
It's what we do.

586
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,200
Something about taxes.

587
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,100
It's very different
than here.

588
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,100
I think you'd like it.

589
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,300
You'll need a tuxedo.

590
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,600
Will I?

591
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,500
You don't need a passport, unless
you want to follow us to Capri after.

592
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,300
Stephanie's uncle's
an ambassador.

593
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,100
Joy.

594
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
My father
will take care of you.

595
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,300
He likes having you around.

596
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,900
You're beautiful,
and you don't talk too much.

597
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm not possessive.

598
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,300
You can be
with anyone you want.

599
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,800
Hello, Joy.
Who is this?

600
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Christien, this is Don.

601
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,000
Bernard and Amelia.

602
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,100
Hello.

603
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,700
Hello.

604
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Hello there.

605
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,100
Did Isabel ring?

606
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,800
Why would she?

607
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,100
Because I'm sick
of her attorneys.

608
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,600
These are my children.
They should be with me.

609
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,700
Are you in Edward's room?

610
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,800
You can have it.

611
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,100
Thank you.

612
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,600
As you can see,
we're very tired.

613
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,600
Come, Bernard.

614
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,600
You gave away our room?

615
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,000
Looks like someone
doesn't want to sleep.

616
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,600
Come in.

617
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,000
Joyce seems
to have stepped away.

618
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,700
I'm sorry, but Mr. Crane
accidentally opened this.

619
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,800
Thank you, Joan.

620
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,800
My, oh, my. A case.

621
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,400
They're all there.
I checked.

622
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,900
All the card says
is that it's for you.

623
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,300
Well, thank you,
Miss Holway.

624
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,900
Why don't you
just take this?

625
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,200
As a finder's fee.

626
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,900
A whole bottle?

627
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,100
It's the good stuff.

628
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,900
I know. Thank you.

629
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,400
Anything else?

630
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
No, thank you.

631
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,700
"The town of Oxford

Looks like Draper
let you off the leash.

Did you see this?

Yes, I did.

Here. These are for everybody.

I'd like to see it
for myself.

649

What's wrong with it?

650

The people.

00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,300
I don't know.

652
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,600
I'm glad to be home.

653
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Has Don checked in?
Is he here?

654
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,600
No. I don't think so.

655
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,600
"...by force, or threat of force,
could long deny that man..."

656
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,900
You look different.

657
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,600
It's my hair.

658
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,400
Right.

659
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,100
Kurt's a homo.

660
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,200
"No judge would be
sure of his..."

661
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,400
So...

662
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,500
are you leaving us?

663
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
No.

664
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,700
So? What, then?

665
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,000
What if I told you that
the international divisions

666
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,800
of General Foods, Bird's Eye,
Campbell's Soup, Chevron Oil,

667
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,200
Lever Brothers, Hoover,
Warner Brothers, Eastern Airlines,

668
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,700
and Chrysler can all
be part of Sterling Cooper?

669
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,000
How is that possible?

670
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,200
St. John Powell, of Putnam, Powell,
and Lowe, called me the other day.

671
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,000
They want to open up a New York office
to deal with their American clients.

672
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,000
They love the idea of just sticking a key
in the door at Sterling Cooper.

673
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,200
Really?

674
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,700
Is this as solid
as American Airlines?

675
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,400
I guess you're happy having to scramble
on the third tier of this industry...

676
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,200
waiting for minor divisions of
major companies to drop in your lap.

677
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,200
On the table will be
mountains of money,

678
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,400
international prestige,
a chance at going public,

679
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,900
and we don't have
to change our name.

680
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,600
I guess we could
think about it.

681
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,300
No. I need to know
that you're open to this.

682
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,800
If so, I'm giving them
five business days to try to impress us

683
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,400
with a price for controlling
interest in the agency.

684
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,600
There he is.

685
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
There's the man
I heard so much about.

686
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,200
Five days to make an offer.

687
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Or you can give me a price
and I'll pass it on.

688
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,200
No.

689
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,300
Let them open the kimono.

690
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,700
Daddy! Daddy!
Over here!

691
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,000
This water hole full.

692
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,100
Stop splashing!

693
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,800
Don't do it, darling.

694
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,200
Yay!

695
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,400
Hello. It's Dick Whitman.

696
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,700
Yeah.

697
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,400
I'd love to see you.

698
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:45,800
Soon.

699
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,800
No. I didn't bring it
with me. Hold on.

700
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,900
I'll see you soon.

701

00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,100
* With just

* My troubles to?

00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,000
* When I'm alone

718
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,700
* With only Dreams of you **
