<i>Meditations in an Emergency</i>

2
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,307
Mrs. Draper,
sorry about the chill in here,

3
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,689
but my wife took
the oil heater upstairs.

4
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:01,929
I'm fine.

5
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,056
So, as I thought last week,

6
00:01:04,176 --> 00:01:06,590
the spotting was not caused
by your horseback riding,

7
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,903
but rather, as I suspected,

8
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,864
you're going to have another baby.

9
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:15,118
Really?

10
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,829
We've been here before.

11
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:19,123
You'll have to start
eating right, sleeping,

12
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:21,618
avoid strenuous activity,
no riding.

13
00:01:22,053 --> 00:01:23,377
Just take it easy.

14
00:01:23,678 --> 00:01:25,628
That's what husbands are for.

15
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,980
I can't believe this.

16
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:32,733
I understand this was a surprise,
but blessings come that way.

17
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:35,553
Of course.

18
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:38,394
I'll need you to undress

19
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:40,918
so I can examine you.

20
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:43,929
Dr. Aldridge,

21
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:46,693
are you sure?

22
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,434
Are you concerned
about your appearance?

23
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:53,076
You've been blessed
with a very resilient figure.

24
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:58,702
I can't have a baby right now.

25
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,248
Mrs. Draper, if we're
having the conversation

26
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:07,918
I think we're having,

27
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:11,224
there are alternatives, obviously.

28
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,547
But I find it hard to believe that,

29
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:19,266
as a married woman of means,
you would even be considering that.

30
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:22,186
That is an option for young girls

31
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:24,745
who have no other options.

32
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:29,991
I guarantee,

33
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,740
the minute you tell your husband,
your friends,

34
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:35,853
you'll stop worrying.

35
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:38,160
Get in the swing of things.

36
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,151
Let's see if I can wrestle
that heater from Charlene.

37
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:06,701
With love from Ken Cosgrove
and Pete Campbell.

38
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,124
Why'd you need it today?

39
00:03:08,244 --> 00:03:10,627
Cooper wanted the ad
revenue projections early.

40
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,930
Why?

41
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,322
Great. Clearasil is missing.

42
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,739
Honestly, I don't know.

43
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:19,513
You don't think it's anything to do with
Draper being AWOL in California, do you?

44
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,328
No, I figured that out.

45
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,345
Campbell says there's
an aerospace gold rush.

46
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,958
I bet Draper's landing a big one.

47
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:29,670
I haven't heard anything.

48
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,340
Or he's breaking off,
opening his own shop in L.A.

49
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:35,500
Or he's finding a good spot

50
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,512
for Sterling Cooper West.

51
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:40,764
I'd love to go to California.
I could get a convertible.

52
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:44,130
Whatever it is,
they're evaluating us.

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,874
If Kennedy's speech goes past 8:30,
that's Lucy, and then Danny Thomas,

54
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,577
then Andy Griffith...
I'll take it in the shorts.

55
00:03:51,527 --> 00:03:53,582
Why am I sick to my stomach?

56
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:01,452
Good. You're here.

57
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,665
I'm waiting on a call
from North American Aviation.

58
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,499
It's 10 there. They should
just be getting into work.

59
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:10,419
I was just wondering if you told
anybody about Clearasil yet.

60
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,505
I guess it must have
slipped my mind.

61
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,511
I don't know what's going on,
but Harry said

62
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,472
there's some kind of
emergency accounting.

63
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,840
Everybody had to turn in
their numbers early.

64
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:23,718
What am I gonna say to Duck?

65
00:04:24,308 --> 00:04:26,436
That my father-in-law hates me?

66
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:29,057
Pete, just tell the truth.

67
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:30,937
Don't worry about the outcome.

68
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:32,507
People respect that.

69
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:35,183
Thank you.

70
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:40,105
I don't want you blaming Creative.

71
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,443
How long have you been here?

72
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,020
Half an hour.

73
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:20,614
I didn't want to bother you.

74
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:22,596
Where have you been?

75
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,706
You disappeared.

76
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,374
I had to have some time
to think about things.

77
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:31,254
Must be nice.

78
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,320
Needing time and just taking it,

79
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,383
all on your own terms,

80
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,649
not wondering what anybody thinks...
me, the children...

81
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:40,769
Bets.

82
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,608
I'd do anything I could

83
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,506
to undo what happened.

84
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:50,582
What happened?

85
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,372
I was not respectful to you.

86
00:06:00,582 --> 00:06:02,632
Well, now I know I'm not crazy.

87
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,460
That helps.

88
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:08,494
I can't walk away from this.

89
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,319
I want to be with you.

90
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,433
I want to be together again.

91
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,170
I don't know.

92
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,842
Honestly, things haven't been
that different without you.

93
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,110
I need to see the kids.

94
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:33,846
I can't deal with this
right now, Don.

95
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,208
I'll call.

96
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,110
We'll make arrangements.

97
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:47,451
Thank you for seeing me.

98
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:49,370
What's your poison?

99
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:50,648
I don't know.

100
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:52,623
It's okay, Campbell.

101
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:54,208
Whatever you're having.

102
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:02,586
Sit down.

103
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:13,085
Clearasil is pulling out.

104
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:15,845
Sales are strong.
Creative is strong.

105
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,692
But we are not suited
for business together.

106
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:21,318
Your father-in-law.

107
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,572
That's a sticky wicket.

108
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,146
Indeed.

109
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,493
I'm working on something
to replace it.

110
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:33,839
Campbell, I'm counting
on your discretion here.

111
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:39,588
The British agency
Putnam, Powell & Lowe

112
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,007
is taking a controlling share
of Sterling Cooper.

113
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,342
Clearasil is in conflict
with Lever Brothers.

114
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:48,171
We're merging...
well, being merged with.

115
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:51,964
Your loyalty and enthusiasm
during the American Airlines thing

116
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:53,267
showed real character.

117
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,710
Thank you.

118
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,294
I'd like you to replace me
as head of accounts.

119
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:03,423
I'm trusting you with this information
because I am going to be the president

120
00:08:03,543 --> 00:08:05,049
of the new Sterling Cooper.

121
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:10,410
Congratulations.

122
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:12,418
Congratulations to you.

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,270
I don't know what to say.

124
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:20,099
You say thank you, and
then you don't say anything.

125
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,153
Such news has to be broken
the right way.

126
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,551
Is Don on board with my promotion?

127
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:30,305
I'm the president.
I don't need his permission, do I?

128
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
Right.

129
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:34,212
If Don shows up,
he'll fall in line.

130
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,460
He'll have to,
or find another profession.

131
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:40,231
That's why God put
non-compete clauses in contracts.

132
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,318
Thank you.

133
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:52,868
<i>Good evening, my fellow citizens.</i>

134
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,848
<i>This government, as promised,</i>

135
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:59,098
<i>has maintained
the closest surveillance</i>

136
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:01,596
<i>of the Soviet military buildup</i>

137
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,254
<i>on the island of Cuba.</i>

138
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:05,570
<i>Within the past week,</i>

139
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:08,593
<i>unmistakable evidence
has established the fact</i>

140
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:12,430
<i>that a series of
offensive missile sites</i>

141

<i>on that imprisoned island.</i>

143
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:18,772
<i>The purpose of these bases</i>

144
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:20,435
<i>can be none other</i>

145

<i>against the Western Hemisphere.</i>

147

148

<i>last Tuesday morning at 9 a.m.,</i>

150
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,005

151
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,401
<i>And having now confirmed...</i>

<i>for supplying Cuba

154
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:46,839

155
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,784

156
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,137
- Welcome back.
- Hildy.

157
00:09:59,888 --> 00:10:02,090
You're a sight for sore eyes.

158
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:04,487
Hello, Joan.
It's good to be back.

159
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:05,714
How are you?

160
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,962
Like everyone else today,
very distracted.

161
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:11,462
Hello, Peggy.

162
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,574
You look well.
How was California?

163
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:14,771
Sunny.

164
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:17,384
Do I work for you now?

165
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,373
I hope it's okay. Mr. Sterling
gave me permission to switch.

166
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:23,597
I landed the Popsicle account.

167
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:27,403
So, other than
her office and haircut,

168
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:29,403
is there anything new
I need to know about?

169
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:30,523
After you.

170
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,589
The world continues without us.

171
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,978
There's no reason
to take it personally.

172
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,523
Do you want to know
if you've been missed?

173
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:48,261
That's half your correspondence.

174
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:50,089
Mr. Sterling has been very anxious

175
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,278
to speak to you on a daily basis,

176
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:53,948
and Mr. Phillips, of course.

177
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:57,493
I'll need the copywriters and Sal
in here to get me up to speed.

178
00:10:57,654 --> 00:10:59,059
Call Roger in a half an hour

179
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:01,089
and tell him I'll meet him
in a half an hour.

180
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:02,559
And Mr. Phillips...

181
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,715
maybe I'll run into him
in the men's room.

182
00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:07,920
I sent your paychecks home.
I assume you've spoken to Mrs. Draper.

183
00:11:08,554 --> 00:11:10,837
- Did she call?
- Not today.

184
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:14,885
I think that's enough to start.

185
00:11:19,122 --> 00:11:21,726
We have a safety protocol
for Civil Defense.

186
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,355
I don't want to start a panic, but
I think people have the right to know.

187
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:28,383
Trust me. I don't think
there'll be a point

188
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:30,819
in taking those stairs
or diving under a desk.

189
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:33,883
So, you're back.

190
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:40,316
What happened?

191
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,748
One minute I'm standing
next to you in the carport,

192
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,401
and the next I'm tap
dancing for General Dynamics.

193
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:47,818
Sorry I missed that.

194
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:51,172
I can't drive. It's amazing
I made any meetings at all.

195
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:52,299
But you did.

196
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:53,757
Of course I did.

197
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,016
Did you ever think I'd left you there
because I thought you could handle it?

198
00:11:58,683 --> 00:11:59,888
How did it go?

199
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:04,102
I'm this close
to North American Aviation.

200
00:12:04,263 --> 00:12:06,113
Then I was right, wasn't I?

201
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:07,415
You handled it.

202
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:09,743
Good work.

203
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:15,546
I know you want everything
the minute you want it.

204
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,992
Sometimes it's better
to wait until you're ready.

205
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:21,619
So you think I'm ready?

206
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:24,309
You proved it.

207
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,503
Now I have to play
a little catch-up ball.

208
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:32,245
Of course.

209
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,346
Welcome back, Don.

210
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,649
- You wanted to see me?
- About three weeks ago.

211
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:56,917
Hope you were looking
for a job in California,

212
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,793
because you're going to need one.

213
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,412
I'll stack my absences
up against yours any day.

214
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:04,315
You can't just do that.

215
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,202
It was important.

216
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:08,871
And from what I can see,
the walls are still standing.

217
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,959
They are.

218
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:11,664
But we sold them

219
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:14,338
and the rest of the company
to Putnam, Powell & Lowe.

220
00:13:14,978 --> 00:13:15,978
What?

221
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:18,043
It's done.
They're coming in Friday

222
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:21,387
to discuss strategy,
management structure, and logistics.

223
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:24,181
You'll find one of these buried
in a stack of crap on your desk.

224
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:26,982
So how much?

225
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:30,522
You'll clear a little
over half a million dollars.

226
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:34,826
Best vacation you ever took.

227
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,764
Look who suddenly
has nothing to say.

228
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,653
Duck put it together.

229
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:46,215
Ran into them
in a bar or something.

230
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:47,830
Duck was in a bar?

231
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,374
He doesn't have a wife.

232
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,041
Any conflicts?

233
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,777
Well, Mona hasn't been
pleasant since my engagement.

234
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:57,326
No. With the deal.

235
00:13:57,728 --> 00:13:59,178
But congratulations.

236
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:00,917
Thank you.

237
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,427
Very few conflicts.

238
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:07,170
Coop and Alice jumped on it.

239
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,809
I wasn't going to make trouble.

240
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,836
Now you can go back
to your office

241
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:15,238
and figure out
how much I made on this.

242
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,356
I guess so.

243
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:24,627
Kennedy's daring them to bomb us,

244
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,941
right when I got a second chance.

245
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:31,262
We don't know what's really going on.
You know that.

246
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:38,020
As Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro

247
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:41,828
push our leadership towards
the threat of nuclear war,

248
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,810
it is tempting to be angry.

249
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:47,514
But I urge all of you to remember

250
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:49,925
that even on the cross

251
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,612
Jesus forgave his transgressors.

252
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:57,137
And although we cannot control
these frightening events,

253
00:14:58,037 --> 00:15:00,714
let us take charge
of our own souls,

254
00:15:02,229 --> 00:15:04,079
and let us prepare ourselves

255
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,183
for the most important
Summit Meeting of all.

256
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,983
And so we pray.

257
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:15,220
We are all sinners,

258
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:17,087
every one of us,

259
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:19,306
but at least

260
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:21,784
give us the courage

261
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,531
and the common sense

262
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,591
to admit it,

263
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,566
to confess it,

264
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,079
and to repair it.

265
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,031
And give us the assurance that,

266
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:39,800
when this temporary
life on Earth ends,

267
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:44,094
we will be welcomed
back into your arms

268
00:15:44,665 --> 00:15:46,415
in your heavenly kingdom.

269
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:49,106
Amen.

270
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:51,229
- Amen.
- Amen.

271
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:06,866
She's awfully quiet.

272
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,859
I think I know what that's about.

273
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:12,329
She's terrified
like the rest of us.

274
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:14,894
I think she's being smug
because she has a bomb shelter.

275
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:16,198
Really?

276
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:19,239
I don't even like to go in the subway.
There's no air.

277
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,419
I prefer you stop
talking about this.

278
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,402
You're upsetting my daughter.

279
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:26,155
TheTimes says you should tell
your children the truth.

280
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,241
You tell your children.

281
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,410
Carlton says

282
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:34,539
he heard the market crashed because
there are Russian troops off Key West.

283
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,111
- They're closing the Interstate.
- They can't do that.

284
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:39,127
Marie, I'm about to leave.

285
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:41,293
I'm done, okay?

286
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:46,107
It's nice to feel the warmth of
the community in a time of crisis.

287
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,862
Mrs. Draper, I'll be
with you in a minute.

288
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,391
I wish we had a shelter
so I could slam the door in her face.

289
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,581
Betty, you're wan.

290
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,174
Do you want a Miltown?

291
00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:05,050
It's the only thing that's keeping me
from chewing my nails off.

292
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:11,390
I'm pregnant.

293
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:20,292
Congratulations?

294
00:17:23,789 --> 00:17:25,506
Jessica was an accident,

295
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,968
and look how happy I am now.

296
00:17:28,793 --> 00:17:30,343
It's not a good time.

297
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,730
Is it ever?

298
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:34,430
Look at this world we live in.

299
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,614
I can't do... I can't do it.

300
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:42,191
What am I going to do?

301
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:44,781
What can you do?

302
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:48,556
I don't think you understand.

303
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,659
It's not a good time.

304
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:56,602
Are you serious?

305
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,770
There's a doctor in Albany.

306
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,153
If you go to Puerto Rico,
they do it in a hospital.

307
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:09,968
Of course you don't want
to go down there right now.

308
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,567
Sometimes the best thing

309
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,341
is just to do nothing and wait.

310
00:18:19,836 --> 00:18:21,965
Mrs. Draper, I'm ready for you.

311
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:27,336
I'll come by and check on you.

312
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,955
No, I'm fine.
You're probably right.

313
00:18:41,635 --> 00:18:43,959
What are you doing in here?
And where's Virginia?

314
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,423
The Soviets fired on us,

315
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:47,589
or we fired on them
or something. Fix it.

316
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,020
I came in to get away
from this speculation.

317
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:57,290
Damn it. You see what you did?

318
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,967
I hope the Soviets got a guy like you
to build those missiles.

319
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:02,102
Everyone's looking
at each other in the street.

320
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:04,821
They're looking at you because
you've got Castro's beard.

321
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:09,444
Now they want a list of people
in all the departments.

322
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:11,892
So? That you and Danny Lindstrom.

323
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:15,196
They're counting all the money.
They're counting all the people.

324
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:18,730
You said this was about an L.A. office.
You told us it wasn't bad.

325
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,491
Someone knows what's going on.

326
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,065
I swear, if it wasn't important,
I wouldn't have asked.

327
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,197
We're doing what we can.

328
00:19:30,317 --> 00:19:32,550
The phone company's
completely overloaded.

329
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:36,303
Actually, Lois,
this is more of a security issue.

330
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,675
Certain calls may have been made

331
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,942
using the code words "Los Angeles."

332
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:44,311
Have you heard anything
about them opening a West Coast office?

333
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,735
You know I'm not allowed
to talk about what I hear in there.

334
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,276
- You can tell us.
- It's not going to hurt you.

335
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:52,218
We'll really owe you.

336
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,747
Have you ever heard
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe?

337
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,653
- London?
- Yes. Trans-Atlantic.

338
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:10,778
Mr. Phillips has made a deal
for them to buy Sterling Cooper.

339
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:17,778
It's done.
They take the keys Friday.

340
00:20:17,898 --> 00:20:19,847
Are they purchasing
Sterling Cooper,

341
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:22,875
or are they combing with them?

342
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:25,685
It's a merger.

343
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,363
From what we could put together,
they want a New York office,

344
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:32,533
and they want it filled with us,

345
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:33,797
but...

346
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:37,558
there's definitely going
to be some...

347
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:39,419
redundancies.

348
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:46,484
Thank you.

349
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:48,755
Wait a minute.

350
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,030
If any of you gets to stay,

351
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,031
one of you has to take me
off the switchboard.

352
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,169
Yeah. Of course.

353
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:57,437
If.

354
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:05,157
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

355
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,485
- We missed you.
- I missed you, too.

356
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,717
I like your hotel room.

357
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:20,908
There's a rollaway
there for you, Bobby.

358
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:24,176
We can go to the movies
or Chinese food.

359
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:27,623
I want you to behave yourselves,
and brush your teeth.

360
00:21:27,914 --> 00:21:31,210
- Do you want to join us?
- Mommy doesn't like to eat.

361
00:21:32,255 --> 00:21:33,605
No, I have plans.

362
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:37,384
Do you want to pick them up
in my office tomorrow?

363
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:39,575
No, drop them off in the morning.

364
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:42,145
I'm going riding.
Carla will be there.

365
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,110
Good night, mommy.

366
00:21:46,383 --> 00:21:47,383
Good night.

367
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:49,757
Good night.

368
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:59,071
Can we order room service?

369
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,118
How can I help you?

370
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:54,731
- Can I get a glass of water?
- Sure.

371
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:01,919
What else?

372
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,304
I don't know.

373
00:23:05,668 --> 00:23:06,668
A gimlet.

374
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:21,570
Thank you.

375
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:25,118
The gentleman's taken care of it.

376
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:30,669
Tell him I said thank you.

377
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,269
I will,

378
00:23:32,857 --> 00:23:35,066
but it means he's going
to come talk to you.

379
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:37,344
We'll see about that.

380
00:23:58,945 --> 00:24:01,763
I think this is
the place to be tonight.

381
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,246
I walked through Times Square.

382
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:06,323
Empty.

383
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:09,457
Doesn't seem real, does it?

384
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:11,110
That's true.

385
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:14,320
You don't look worried.

386
00:24:15,124 --> 00:24:17,126
I'm trying not to think about it.

387
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,370
To not thinking about things.

388
00:24:24,857 --> 00:24:26,207
What's your name?

389
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:30,408
Thank you so much for the drink.

390
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,627
I'd just like to enjoy it,
if you don't mind.

391
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,323
No. Of course.

392
00:24:37,658 --> 00:24:39,084
Nice meeting you.

393
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:42,143
<i>... degrees for New York City.
Cloudy skies.</i>

394
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:45,435
<i>Further action of an unspecified nature
is being considered to deal</i>

395
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:47,899
<i>with a continuing Soviet
missile buildup in Cuba.</i>

396
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,738
<i>That statement from Department
Press Officer Lincoln White,</i>

397
00:24:50,858 --> 00:24:53,705
<i>a revelation that construction
of missile sites is continuing.</i>

398
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,540
It's delicious.

399
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,984
You're crazy.

400
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:00,821
Can I have a milk shake?

401
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:03,296
- What's wrong with root beer?
- Daddy?

402
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:07,365
- Daddy...
- It'll take 45 minutes, you know.

403
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:08,935
Daddy, knock-knock.

404
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:11,859
- Who's there?
- Dwayne.

405
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:13,554
Dwayne who?

406
00:25:13,674 --> 00:25:16,124
Dwayne the bathtub.
Mama, I'm dwowning.

407
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:18,424
Can we watch TV?

408
00:25:23,212 --> 00:25:25,546
Can you watch these for me, please?

409
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,824
What are you doing here?

410
00:25:57,483 --> 00:25:58,605
I'm waiting.

411
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:44,673
I'm married.

412
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,927
<i>I was just about ready
to come by and pick you up.</i>

413
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:47,690
<i>I know, Wally,
and I'm sick about it.</i>

414
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:49,381
<i>I could just die.</i>

415
00:27:50,984 --> 00:27:52,724
<i>Before you go
and do something like that,</i>

416
00:27:52,844 --> 00:27:54,025
<i>I got an idea.</i>

417
00:27:54,415 --> 00:27:56,887
<i>What if I got Beaver
to call your sister</i>

418
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:59,160
<i>and see if he could
talk her into going?</i>

419
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,567
<i>Say, maybe that would work.</i>

420
00:28:05,878 --> 00:28:07,522
So what is your name?

421
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:14,381
What are you doing in there?

422
00:28:21,248 --> 00:28:22,954
We were just about to close.

423
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,875
Anita wanted to come,
but she's with the children.

424
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:29,344
- That's where she should be.
- My mother baked.

425
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:32,798
Thought we'd all appreciate something
fresh if we get stuck in here.

426
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:34,593
And how are you?

427
00:28:35,657 --> 00:28:36,845
I don't know.

428
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:39,090
Nuclear war.

429
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,765
We could be gone tomorrow.

430
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:44,806
Well, isn't that always the case?

431
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:47,071
That's true.

432
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:50,733
You believe in God.

433
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:53,903
I've seen that in you
from the moment we met.

434
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:00,531
Sometimes I feel

435
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:04,261
he called me to this parish
to reach you.

436
00:29:07,218 --> 00:29:08,868
No. I didn't know that.

437
00:29:09,288 --> 00:29:10,538
Well, it's true.

438
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:14,371
Hell is serious and very real,

439
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:18,093
and unless you unburden yourself,
you cannot know peace.

440
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:20,906
I understand that, Father,

441
00:29:21,308 --> 00:29:23,475
but you're upsetting me right now.

442
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:25,289
That is your guilt, Peggy.

443
00:29:26,272 --> 00:29:29,101
All that God wants is for you
to reconcile with him.

444
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:31,881
Don't... don't you understand

445
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:35,027
that this could be the end of the world
and you could go to hell?

446
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:39,298
I can't believe
that's the way God is.

447
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:44,750
Good night, Father.

448
00:30:33,338 --> 00:30:34,378
Really?

449
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:35,475
The silver?

450
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,942
There could be looting.

451
00:30:38,252 --> 00:30:41,720
A mob is going to come to the 14th floor
of this apartment building?

452
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,750
I wish you would come
with me right now.

453
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,348
What if something happens?

454
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:49,259
Rehoboth Beach
is 90 minutes from D.C.

455
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:52,380
You don't understand these bombs.

456
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,017
Your parents' deck chairs
will be on Fifth Avenue.

457
00:30:56,186 --> 00:30:58,598
Are you trying
to make me more upset?

458
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,259
If for some reason
the train doesn't work,

459
00:31:02,516 --> 00:31:06,133
just take a few hundred dollars in cash
and pay someone to drive you.

460
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,619
This is ridiculous.

461
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:11,207
If I'm going to die,
I want to die in Manhattan.

462
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:13,376
Stop that kind of talk, Peter.

463
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:15,602
There's no difference
and I want to be here,

464
00:31:15,722 --> 00:31:17,505
and you want to be with your parents.

465
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:19,378
Why do you always
make it about that?

466
00:31:19,498 --> 00:31:22,065
And yes, I love my parents,
and they love me.

467
00:31:22,185 --> 00:31:23,131
Do you?

468
00:31:23,775 --> 00:31:26,180
If you did,
you'd want to be with me.

469
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:29,210
You're right.

470
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:40,532
I'll help you pack the car.

471
00:31:42,357 --> 00:31:44,126
<i>The first Russian ship</i>

472
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:46,000
<i>that proceed through the area</i>

473
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,375
<i>patrolled by our Navy forces...</i>

474
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:50,412
Bad news.

475
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:51,731
What?

476
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:53,749
The conference room's
signed out all day.

477
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,440
And I checked the fridge.

478
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,586
There's canapés, really good ones.

479
00:31:57,873 --> 00:32:00,448
They shampooed
the carpets last night.

480
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:04,798
PPL's coming in today.

481
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:06,762
You told me she told you that.

482
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:08,985
You're not worried?
Why'd you come in?

483
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:11,457
I don't know. I'm just
waiting to see what happens.

484
00:32:11,823 --> 00:32:13,644
I talked to my
father-in-law about it.

485
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:15,854
Regime change is always tricky.

486
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,752
You want to stay neutral.

487
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:19,641
The loyalists are always hung,

488
00:32:19,761 --> 00:32:21,902
and you don't want to get
caught in the fallout.

489
00:32:22,063 --> 00:32:23,670
What's wrong with you?

490
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,198
Aren't you loyal to anyone?

491
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,084
They don't care about us.

492
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:30,066
We're just a bunch
of salaries on a ledger.

493
00:32:30,186 --> 00:32:32,538
They'll draw a line and get
rid of everything below it.

494
00:32:32,997 --> 00:32:35,147
I like this company the way it is.

495
00:32:46,148 --> 00:32:47,177
Have a minute?

496
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,764
From the look of this,
that might be all I have.

497
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:50,980
May I?

498
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,292
I'm coming to you anonymously, Don.

499
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,569
I know something
I think you should know.

500
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:04,666
What?

501
00:33:05,173 --> 00:33:06,879
I know about the merger,

502
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:10,857
and I know that Duck Phillips
is going to be the president.

503
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:14,216
How do you know that?

504
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:15,791
He told me.

505
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,278
Why would he do that?

506
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:20,566
Picking sides, I guess.

507
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,381
Why are you telling me this?

508
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:26,665
I don't know.

509
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:28,955
I just thought if I was you,

510
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:30,968
I would want to know.

511
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:34,232
Thank you.

512
00:33:41,832 --> 00:33:44,194
You know they stopped
a ship this morning.

513
00:33:46,523 --> 00:33:49,416
I bet the Russians are reconsidering,
now that we made a stand.

514
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,260
- Carla, what's this?
- That's from Mr. Draper.

515
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,791
<i>Dear Betty,</i>

516
00:34:21,432 --> 00:34:24,858
<i>I'm sitting in the Roosevelt looking
at the backs of Bobby and Sally's heads</i>

517
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:26,305
<i>as they watch TV.</i>

518
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:29,027
<i>I'm not letting them
change the channel</i>

519
00:34:29,147 --> 00:34:30,832
<i>because watching the news
makes me sick,</i>

520
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,183
<i>and they can see it.</i>

521
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:36,735
<i>I think about you and
how I behaved</i>

522
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:39,037
<i>and my regret.</i>

523
00:34:39,735 --> 00:34:42,584
<i>I know it's my fault
you are not here right now.</i>

524
00:34:43,694 --> 00:34:46,797
<i>I understand why you feel
it's better to go on without me,</i>

525
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:50,174
<i>and I know that you won't
be alone for very long,</i>

526
00:34:50,831 --> 00:34:52,651
<i>but, without you,</i>

527
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,894
<i>I'll be alone forever.</i>

528
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:57,607
<i>I love you.</i>

529
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:08,320
Gentlemen, now that we've done
haggling over the dowry,

530
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:12,114
it's time to slip into the tent
and spend a night with the bride.

531
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,549
We imagine that Sterling Cooper

532
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:20,081
will remain some what autonomous.

533
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:23,137
You bought us.
We don't expect autonomy,

534
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:25,674
but who's going to be
minding the store

535
00:35:25,794 --> 00:35:28,595
when you all fly back to England?

536
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:32,643
Since we've worked with him before
and he knows both companies,

537
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,680
Duck Phillips will be
President of Sterling Cooper.

538
00:35:36,984 --> 00:35:38,106
My goodness.

539
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,393
Obviously, I accept.

540
00:35:42,044 --> 00:35:43,394
That makes sense.

541
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:45,171
Congratulations.

542
00:35:46,631 --> 00:35:49,122
Well, I promise,
in spite of this title,

543
00:35:49,242 --> 00:35:51,300
I will treat the founders
of Sterling Cooper

544
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,370
with the respect they deserve.

545
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,489
Duck, it has now
become your meeting.

546
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:57,159
Tell us what you see.

547
00:35:59,843 --> 00:36:02,364
I find myself a little
unprepared here,

548
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:03,666
but I know this.

549
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,503
I'd like to bring this company
into financial maturity.

550
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:08,797
The last two years,
we've been held back.

551
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,675
Good creative is important,
but it can't be running the show.

552
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,561
Our business is about
buying time and space,

553
00:36:15,681 --> 00:36:17,613
and right now
that means television.

554
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:20,011
The bigger we are,
the cheaper we can get it.

555
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:23,899
I don't think I heard
the word client once.

556
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:27,817
Bert, when the economy is good,
people buy things,

557
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,901
and when it's bad, they don't.

558
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,932
There's no reason for us to be tied
to Creative's fantasies of persuasion.

559
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,410
It certainly is an amtious way
of thinking about things.

560
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:44,233
What?

561
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,482
I think it sounds
like a great agency,

562
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,927
and I think Duck
is the man to run it.

563
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,965
I just don't think
I'll be a part of it.

564
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:57,511
You don't want to be a part of it?

565
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,723
If this is the agency you want,

566
00:36:59,976 --> 00:37:01,849
Duck is the man for the job.

567
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,535
This is what I'm talking about.

568
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,270
Artistic temperament.

569
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,336
Don, is this really necessary?

570
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:09,331
It is.

571
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:12,736
Because he loves this room and hearing
his own voice and saving the day.

572
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,217
Except this time
he's got to get with a team.

573
00:37:15,482 --> 00:37:18,824
You can either honor your contract
or walk out that door with nothing

574
00:37:18,944 --> 00:37:20,452
and start selling insurance.

575
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:24,320
I don't have a contract.

576
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:27,547
We're close.

577
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,543
We didn't think we needed one.

578
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:34,382
Gentlemen.

579
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,428
I sell products, not advertising.

580
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:43,995
I can't see as far
into the future as Duck,

581
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:47,571
but if the world
is still here on Monday,

582
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,654
we can talk.

583
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:54,819
Don, hold on.

584
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:00,466
Let him go.

585
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:02,274
Take a second to find some kid

586
00:38:02,394 --> 00:38:04,579
who can write a prose poem
to a potato chip.

587
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:05,847
Calm down.

588
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,333
Let him throw his tantrum.

589
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:10,376
The man disappeared for 3 damn weeks,
and I put this deal together.

590
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,128
What more do you need to know?

591
00:38:16,342 --> 00:38:18,792
Duck, would you
excuse us for a minute?

592
00:38:22,844 --> 00:38:23,844
Of course.

593
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,612
This doesn't affect
the merger, does it?

594
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:42,080
He never could hold his liquor.

595
00:38:45,997 --> 00:38:48,698
Your wife called.
She wants you to come home.

596
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,476
You should go home as well.

597
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,253
I can't even think right now.

598
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,981
Greg says they put
St. Luke's on alert.

599
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:09,200
Your bag.

600
00:39:10,164 --> 00:39:11,529
I don't need it.

601
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:13,779
Good night.

602
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:37,087
- Why are you smiling?
- Because you're still here.

603
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:39,049
I was hoping the train
would be empty.

604
00:39:39,946 --> 00:39:41,383
Have a drink with me.

605
00:39:54,444 --> 00:39:56,775
Why are you still here?
Trudy must be worried.

606
00:39:58,003 --> 00:39:59,600
What is it with you?

607
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,938
What?

608
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:05,324
You never let me talk
about what I want to talk about.

609
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:09,287
Well, what do you
want to talk about?

610
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,160
About what you said
about the truth.

611
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:17,253
Can I tell you the truth?

612
00:40:17,556 --> 00:40:19,100
Why wouldn't you?

613
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:21,326
You make it so hard.

614
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,789
What are you talking about?

615
00:40:25,754 --> 00:40:26,623
You.

616
00:40:31,078 --> 00:40:33,732
I've been thinking about
everything that's going on.

617
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:36,751
And I thought...

618
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:39,939
Who'd care if I was gone?

619
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,318
I mean, Trudy would care,

620
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:44,088
but she doesn't know me.

621
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:46,876
But you do.

622
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:50,375
And I know you.

623
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:55,540
And I think you're perfect.

624
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,612
I'm not perfect, Pete.

625
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:01,749
Yes, you are.

626
00:41:04,206 --> 00:41:06,449
And I wish I picked you then.

627
00:41:14,564 --> 00:41:15,564
I love you.

628
00:41:17,428 --> 00:41:19,313
And I want to be with you.

629
00:41:24,757 --> 00:41:25,938
What?

630
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:29,302
Didn't you know that?

631
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,584
I could have had you
in my life forever

632
00:41:40,687 --> 00:41:41,915
if I wanted to.

633
00:41:44,565 --> 00:41:45,915
What do you mean?

634
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:49,550
I could have had you.

635
00:41:50,198 --> 00:41:52,640
I could have shamed you
into being with me.

636
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:57,426
But I didn't want to.

637
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,140
I don't understand.

638
00:42:09,228 --> 00:42:10,731
You got me pregnant.

639
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:15,233
I had a baby,

640
00:42:16,749 --> 00:42:18,390
and I gave it away.

641
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:20,612
What?

642
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,191
I had your baby,

643
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:28,827
and I gave it away.

644
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:33,797
Are you serious?

645
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:41,407
You can't be serious.

646
00:42:42,872 --> 00:42:44,657
I wanted other things.

647
00:42:47,204 --> 00:42:48,810
I don't understand.

648
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:58,135
One day you're there...

649
00:43:00,485 --> 00:43:02,410
and then, all of a sudden...

650
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:05,561
there's less of you,

651
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:11,180
and you wonder
where that part went,

652
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,126
if it's living
somewhere outside of you.

653
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:22,507
And you keep thinking...

654
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:26,609
maybe you'll get it back.

655
00:43:31,237 --> 00:43:33,072
And then you realize...

656
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:36,671
it's just gone.

657
00:43:41,672 --> 00:43:43,522
Why would you tell me that?

658
00:43:47,577 --> 00:43:49,047
I'm sorry, Pete.

659
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:15,798
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

660
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:17,381
You're home.

661
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,129
<i>At about 2 p.m.
yesterday afternoon,</i>

662
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:14,010
<i>set out to intercept the MARUCLA.</i>

663
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:19,199
<i>She was assisted
by S2F's tracker aircraft.</i>

664
00:45:19,981 --> 00:45:22,916
<i>The Pierce made contact
with the MARUCLA...</i>

665
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:24,351
They finally went down.

666
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:26,919
<i>... at about 10:30 p.m. last night,</i>

667
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:29,412
<i>Eastern Daylight Time.</i>

668
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,335
<i>Sometime after midnight...</i>

669
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:33,850
I have to talk to you.

670
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,325
<i>Pierce was joined by the destroyer</i>

671
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:38,274
<i>Joseph F. Kennedy.</i>

672
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:52,754
I have something to tell you.

673
00:45:54,344 --> 00:45:55,295
What?

674
00:46:06,645 --> 00:46:07,861
I'm pregnant.

675
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,562
SEE YOU AGAIN NEXT SEASON...



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
