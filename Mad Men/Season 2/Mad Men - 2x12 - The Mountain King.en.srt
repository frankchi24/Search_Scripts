1
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,500
MAD MAN S02E12

2
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,600
Sally, those go in your room.

3
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,700
And Bobby, put your trucks
in the toy box.

4
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,800
I'm not your maid.

5
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,700
What do you think you're doing?

6
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,100
Nothing.

7
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,000
Get over here.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,500
You could burn the house down.

9
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,900
You're hurting me.

10
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,700
Good.

11
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,300
I can't believe you were smoking.

12
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,000
I wasn't.

13
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,500
Go upstairs.

14
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,500
You're not going to be
watching television.

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,200
You're not going to be
playing with your friends.

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm taking away Barbie.

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
- You're mean.
- You betcha.

18
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,700
Get in there.

19
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,400
I'm telling Daddy when he gets home.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,000
Go ahead.

21
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,400
He left because you're stupid and mean.

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,300
You want to  sleep in there?

23
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,800
Why won't you let him come home?

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Is that what you think?

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,600
His suitcase is here, and he's not.

26
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,900
Daddy's on a trip.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,700
I told you.

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
It's for business.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
Can we call him on the phone?

30
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
It's long distance.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,500
And I know he'd be very upset about
you doing what you just did.

32
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,100
Please don't tell.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Take your school books upstairs.

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,200
As soon as Carla gets here,
I'm going riding,

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,300
and I want a good report.

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,500
Who wants a Popsicle
when it's snowing?

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
Don't they sell enough
during the summer?

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,600
Obviously not.

39
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,500
I love Popsicles.

40
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,800
I can't think in here.

41
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,900
It's a storage closet, not an office.

42
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,300
I called the meeting.

43
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,000
Where are the refreshments?

44
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,500
Why do moms give treats?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
There's no good reason.

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,300
My mom would come out
to the truck with us.

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,700
She'd break the Popsicles in half

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,500
and give it to us like Jesus
at the Last Supper.

49
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,600
Sounds cheap.

50
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,500
No. My mother did it, too.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,900
It was great.

52
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,900
In Vermont, we made
our own ice cream.

53
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,300
It was a pain in the ass.

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,000
Everyone breaks Popsicles in half.

55
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,800
So?

56
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,600
You can do it all year 'round.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,100
The ritual. It's like Communion.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
It's kind of Catholic, isn't it?

59
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,500
It's Christian,

60
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
as in behavior, not religion.

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,100
Let me tell you something.

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,700
The Catholic Church
knows how to sell things.

63
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,700
Any calls?

64
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,200
Mr. Peterson had some question
about your expenses regarding--

65
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Why doesn't he just die already?

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,600
Lutase.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Christ. It's IBM.

68
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,400
Myopic.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
What else?

70
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,600
And you have an appointment
with Spence-Chapin on Thursday.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,700
Who's that?

72
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,300
Spence-Chapin, the adoption agency.

73
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,100
I'm sorry. What?

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Mrs. Campbell set it,

75
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,700
and, well, I'm sorry,
I have to say something.

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Good luck.

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,600
Yes, of course.

78
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:45,900
Thank you.

79
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,000
I think it's one of
the most blessed things

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,700
that a person would give
a home to an abandoned child.

81
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,400
Shall I get Mrs. Campbell
on the line?

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Just get me Bert Peterson.

83
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,700
Well, hello, there.

84
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,600
Hello, Bertram.

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,300
Is Florence with you?

86
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,200
No. She's taking care of her mother.

87
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,400
Then we were thinking about going to
the Breakers through New Year's.

88
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,500
She's a good companion, isn't she?

89
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,400
She's moody.

90
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,600
Damn it, Alice.
I don't ask much of you--

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,300
My stockings cost more
than your carpeting.

92
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,200
Have you looked everything over?

93
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,400
It's a very generous offer.

94
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,200
Hmm.

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
I always say it's the smartest thing

96
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,800
I ever did helping you out.

97
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,000
22.50 per share per year
for the next 10 years?

98
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,800
To think that Mother
thought you were a failure.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,600
She made me who I am.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,400
Do you mind if I have a drink?

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,200
Sweet vermouth, please.

102
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000
You can trust Cleveland.

103
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,400
You said on the telephone
you were undecided.

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
What's your hesitation?

105
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,200
I promised to take care of Roger.

106
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,900
Oh. Let Roger Sterling have
what he always

107
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,300
wanted to die in the arms
of a 20-year-old.

108
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,200
The truth is you don't want to retire,

109
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,500
and I hate to say this, Bertram,

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,300
but you are old--

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
older than me.

112
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,700
I can't even imagine
what that must be like.

113
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,600
Hmm. Charming.

114
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,500
Please. You're not well.

115
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,000
This is what I do.

116
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,700
It's a merger you continue to do it.

117
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll be as useful as
the Queen of England.

118
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,500
Don't you wantto go to Montana?

119
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
You ruined that
poor architect's life.

120
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,600
Go visit your cattle.

121
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,400
I do love them.

122
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,500
But you can't trust the Brits.

123
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
I've left a letter on my bureau.

124
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,600
If I'm not back in two days,
the police will be here.

125
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,600
Why would you bring that up?

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,300
Because I don't want you to hurt me.

127
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,800
I just want to know
where my husband is.

128
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a simple misunderstanding.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,100
There's a lot of men
with my name.

130
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,700
You're the only one who used
my husband's serial number

131
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,600
to get a driver's license.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
Car title. Apartment lease.

133
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,200
Do you have a
birth certificate?

134
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
In a safe deposit box.

135
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,600
Will you stop?

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,200
I saw the look on your face.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't know what to say.

138
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,700
There's been a mistake.

139
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,900
Can't you be a human being?

140
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm his wife.

141
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't care what
he asked you to do.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,800
I need to know.

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I have to get back to work.

144
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,600
Stop lying.

145
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
You've been caught.

146
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,600
Don't make me do something
I don't want to do.

147
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,200
He died.

148
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,500
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

150
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,500
Are you sure?

152
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,500
He never said he had a wife.

153
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,200
Seven years.

154
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,400
I'm very, very sorry.

155
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,900
What happened?

156
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,700
He was killed in combat.

157
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,100
So who are you?

158
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,900
They thought I was him
and he was me.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
I didn't think
I was hurting anyone.

160
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I can't believe it.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,900
I just had to get
out of there.

162
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,500
What are you going
to do to me?

163
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,900
He never mentioned me.

164
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,300
I didn't know him long. Maybe--

165
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,500
What's your name?

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Anna.

167
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,900
I don't know what to say.

168
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm making good money, if that's--

169
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,800
I know I owe you more than money.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,300
I have his purple heart

171
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,900
and his dog tags, if you want them.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,400
He wanted to marry my sister.

173
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,300
She looks just like me,
with two good legs.

174
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,200
What is your name?

175
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,400
Dick Whitm.

176
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,900
Well, Dick,

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,100
what do I do with you?

178
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,300
Well, this is a  welcome surprise.

179
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,600
I can come back.

180
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,200
Oh no. Come. See this.

181
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I guess all you needed
was an audience.

182
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Are you next?

183
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,100
I don't play.

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
Teddy, this is my friend Dick.

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Hi.

186
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
It's called, "The Hall
of the Mountain King."

187
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,000
It's scary.

188
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,300
I know.

189
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,500
Take a lollipop.
I'll see you next week.

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,300
Bye, Mrs. Draper.

191
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,900
You're tan.

192
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,600
Are you here on vacation?

193
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,900
No.

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,700
Business.

195
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,200
You look good.

196
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,800
Where are your things?

197
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,200
Or are you just here for the day?

198
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,900
I didn't even think about it.

199
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,800
I didn't mean to intrude. I can--

200
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,500
Are you in trouble?

201
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,500
No.

202
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,400
Well, then, what?

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,200
Can I take a shower and lie down?

204
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,500
Of course.

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,500
Trudy!

206
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,200
You're late.

207
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,000
Spence-Chapin. How did that happen?

208
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,200
I put us on the list.
And...I don't know.

209
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,000
We went right to the top.

210
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, I'm not going,
and neither are you.

211
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,600
Peter, you're shouting.

212
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,200
Don't do that.

213
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,000
Listen to me very carefully.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,800
We are not adopting a child.

215
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,300
That's final.

216
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,500
Will you calm down, and we can talk--

217
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Hell's bells, Trudy!
That is final!

218
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,500
You don't speak to me that way!

219
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
You have lost your mind!

220
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,400
We now return to tonight's
"Million Dollar Movie"

221
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,800
presentation of...

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,800
The Day the Earth Stood Still.

223
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm glad you're not tired anymore.

224
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,700
I am, but my autopilot's working.

225
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,500
What are you doing?

226
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,200
You're tired.
Let me do the driving.

227
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,300
It's okay.

228
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,900
Joanie. Joanie, Joanie.

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,600
Stop.

230
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:15,900
Honey.

231
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,900
You know what? I am tired.

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Okay.

233
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,300
<i>May I think so?</i>

234
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,000
<i>Warm, friendly, intelligent...</i>

235
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,100
Is something wrong?

236
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,100
Where'd you pick that up?

237
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,100
Greg, stop that.

238
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,300
You know there is no before.

239
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,700
Right.

240
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm sorry that I don't know
all the things you want.

241
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,600
But you do.

242
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm on call again on Wednesday.

243
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,200
<i>Why don't you wait in here
while I get my things?</i>

244
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,800
Whose pants have a 38 inseam?

245
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,400
Harold.

246
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
I would like to meet him.

247
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I kicked him out.

248
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,000
Even though old ladies
shouldn't be picky.

249
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,600
It's beautiful here.

250
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,400
You like the porch?

251
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,700
You paid for it.

252
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,700
I think about you.

253
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,100
Just in passing, I'll wonder.

254
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,400
They were making a commercial
on the pier.

255
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
And then you called me.

256
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
How about that?

257
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,300
You've been in California too long.

258
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,300
How old are your children now?

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,900
Sally is 8.

260
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,200
Bobby is 5.

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,300
If you don't want to
talk about what happened,

262
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,200
that's fine.

263
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,600
But you can, you know.

264
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,300
I always felt that we met so that
both of our lives could be better.

265
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,300
That's just how
it is between us.

266
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,600
I ruined everything.

267
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,600
My family, my wife...

268
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
my kids.

269
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,800
I'm sure that's not true.

270
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,800
My brother came to find me.

271
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,900
I told him to go away.

272
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,600
I didn't know you had a brother.

273
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,300
I've told you things
I've never told Betty.

274
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,300
Why does it have to be that way?

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,800
You love her.

276
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,700
You don't have to tell her everything.

277
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,600
I'm sure there are things
about her you don't know.

278
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,500
Do you want to call?

279
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
No.

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,200
That would just confuse things.

281
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,900
Then what are you going to do?

282
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,400
I don't know.

283
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,500
I have been watching my life.

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,800
It's right there.

285
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,400
I keep...

286
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,000
scratching at it,
trying to get into it.

287
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,400
I can't.

288
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
I'm sorry.

289
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
Did you get the same thing in your
stocking last night that I did?

290
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,200
What are you talking about?

291
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,900
Putnam, Powell & Lowe has offered

292
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,700
to put a lot of marmalade
on your toast.

293
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,500
Sit, Roger.

294
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,800
There's no rush. We have 72 hours.

295
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,700
Yes. Well,

296
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't like being in the position

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,700
0f having to sell off my life's work

298
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,300
because you have an increase
in overhead.

299
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,400
So Mona's crying
on your shoulder now?

300
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
The late Mrs. Cooper introduced you.

301
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,100
Well, let her know
it didn't work out.

302
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,000
Bert,

303
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,900
I know you don't think
I got my hands dirty.

304
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm sorry I missed
the Great Depression.

305
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,500
Still, I have served this
place for the last 20 years.

306
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,200
It's a merger.
We can still come to work

307
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,700
in our building, in our offices,

308
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,200
only they'll be diamonds
on the doorknobs.

309
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,500
So we'll have a meeting
of the partners.

310
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,400
And for your information,
Jane makes me very happy.

311
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,300
That's good to know.

312
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,500
As Don illuminated, advertising
is essential for aerospace,

313
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,600
especially in reaching
outto the public

314
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,300
to see that... congressmen vote

315
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,000
for the spending bills
which bring new jobs.

316
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,900
Actual advertising,
not public relations.

317
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,800
<i>I have your father-in-law
on line 1.</i>

318
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,800
Tom. How are you?

319
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,600
Well, Peter, um,

320
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
to be honest,

321
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,400
I don't like having to
make this phone call.

322
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,500
Oh? Why not?

323
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Well, we've been thinking
about things over here,

324
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,800
and we're going to have to
put Clearasil up for review.

325
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,200
Really?

326
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,600
That's a shock, Tom.

327
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
Now,

328
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,400
why would you do that?
Sales have been spectacular.

329
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,800
All right, calm down.

330
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,700
I said review,
not that we're moving.

331
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,600
You'll have 90 days to turn it around.

332
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,000
Turn what around?

333
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
You're distracted.

334
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,200
What are we talking about, Tom?

335
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,500
Look, son--

336
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,600
Every good businessman knows that,

337
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,200
if his wife's unhappy, his work suffers.

338
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,500
Yes, they seem very directly
related in this case.

339
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,700
Don't they, Tom?

340
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,900
Trudy's happiness should be
your first priority.

341
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,000
I think you should
pull Clearasil right now.

342
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't think you're going to
get what you want.

343
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,500
What about my daughter?

344
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,800
She's my wife. That's between us.

345
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,900
You know what?

346
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,400
I was in love with Trudy
when I met her.

347
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,100
And then you stuck your nose in,

348
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,900
put these ideas in her mind,
and made her unhappy.

349
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,400
<i>What do you mean,
you were in love with her?</i>

350
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

351
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,500
Yes. Um, perhaps it is best
if we just give notice.

352
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,400
Good-bye, Tom.

353
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,300
I bought you some clothes.

354
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,900
Tomorrow morning.

355
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,900
There's something else.

356
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,500
What?

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,200
I met a girl.

358
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,600
Another one?

359
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:57,000
She's so beautiful and happy.

360
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,300
She's a model.

361
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,500
And she's from a good family,

362
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,000
and she's educated.

363
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,300
What's her name?

364
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,600
Elizabeth. Betty.

365
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,200
I want you to meet her.

366
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,900
Look at you.

367
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,600
You're in the lavender haze.

368
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,800
I just like the way she laughs,

369
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,800
and the way she looks at me.

370
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Yes.

371
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,400
You are very hard to look at.

372
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,600
I wanna ask her to marry me.

373
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,900
Oh, Dick, that's wonderful.

374
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,200
Well, I need you to give me a divorce.

375
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
Of course.

376
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,200
I never thought of that.

377
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,600
You should hire a lawyer out here.
I'll pay for it.

378
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,900
And I want you to know that

379
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,600
I'm going to take care of you forever.

380
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,100
You don't have to do that.

381
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,500
I do.

382
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,600
You don't owe me anything.

383
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,700
This whole life,

384
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,900
if it wasn't for Don,

385
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,400
- if it wasn't--
- Stop that.

386
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So...

387
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,200
...there'll be another Mrs. Draper.

388
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,200
I guess so.

389
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,200
You'll have a family.

390
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,900
That'll be good for you.

391
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,300
I want to.

392
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,100
This will probably be
our last Christmas together.

393
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,900
Why?

394
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Oh, Dick.

395
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,400
You're gonna be my cousin.

396
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,600
No.

397
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,200
This is a chance at a whole new life.

398
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Thank you, Anna.

399
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,300
So where's Don?

400
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,900
I'm sure you remember Peggy Olsen.

401
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,500
She'll be walking you through this.

402
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,000
And when Don climbs out
from under the weather--

403
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,800
Don has signed off on all of this.

404
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,800
When I was little,

405
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,100
my mother would take a twin pop

406
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,800
and break it in half

407
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,800
and give one to me
and one to my sister.

408
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,200
We were completely equal in her eyes.

409
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,900
Beloved.

410
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
Everyone does this with Popsicles,

411
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,700
but they may not realize
what it means.

412
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,100
It has nothing to do with an
ice cream truck on a hot summer day,

413
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,500
or the flavor,

414
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
or the color.

415
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,300
It's a ritual.

416
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,200
You take it, break it, share it, love it.

417
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,600
People do do that.

418
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,600
This act of sharing,
it's what a Popsicle is.

419
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,100
It's the same treat from the freezer
as it is from the truck.

420
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,500
I don't care if it's snowing
or hailing or 100 degrees.

421
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,700
You can still take it, break it,
share it, and love it.

422
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,300
I like the way
she's handing out the pops.

423
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,200
The kids are excited, but...

424
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
the mom reminds me of something.

425
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,100
No, this is original.

426
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,300
Well, I can tell you this now,

427
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,700
but we wanted something
with the word love in it.

428
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,600
When asked, the first thing
people say is,

429
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,800
"I love Popsicles."

430
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,500
Carson residence.

431
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,200
Sarah Beth, it's Betty Draper.

432
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,800
Oh, hello, Betty.

433
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,900
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

434
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,300
I'm at my wit's end.

435
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,300
Sally--

436
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,700
I think she may need private school.

437
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,900
<i>How does Becky
like Rockland Country Day?</i>

438
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,100
Well, it's a drive,
but she seems more independent.

439
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
I haven't seen you at the stables.

440
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,200
I saw it in the paper

441
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,600
that Tara and Arthur are
getting married next weekend.

442
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,100
Yes, I heard that.

443
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,200
Well, I hope they're
very happy together.

444
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,700
Are you there?

445
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
Betty,

446
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,500
I'm sick about it.

447
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,300
Oh, I'm sorry.

448
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,400
That's why they call them crushes.

449
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,500
It was more than that.

450
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,900
Really?

451
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,500
<i>I'm telling you,
I haven't been able to sleep.</i>

452
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,500
I keep thinking about him.

453
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,200
I think Raymond knows.

454
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,600
I can't even look at Becky.

455
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,700
What did you do?

456
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,100
Oh, Betty, I made a terrible mistake.

457
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,300
<i>You did?</i>

458
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,600
Don't act surprised. He told me
all the things you said about me.

459
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,200
I was grateful.

460
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,700
Why would you do that?

461
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,100
What?

462
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,500
You wanted him, too.
You know you did.

463
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,400
There's a difference
between wanting and having.

464
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,800
You did everything you could
to encourage me.

465
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,200
I didn't make you do anything.

466
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,000
My God, you're an awful woman,
you know that?

467
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,700
No one made you sleep with him!

468
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,200
I'm going to tell you this,
and you can tell all your little friends.

469
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
This is a delicate piece of machinery.

470
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,300
You don't just shove paper in it.

471
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,000
You don't bang on the buttons.

472
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,800
You don't sit on the glass.

473
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,100
If you want it to work,
you have to treat it with respect.

474
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
What do you want?

475
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,600
I need to speak with you.

476
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,600
Honey, I have a 6:30 dinner reservation,

477
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,100
and unless you want to pull me
there in a rickshaw, I have to get going.

478
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Well, um, I'm a copywriter.

479
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,600
Why, did I call you something else?

480
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,400
No.

481
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,300
I don't know if you're aware,

482
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,500
but I brought in
the Popsicle account today.

483
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
On my own.

484
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,700
Hey, Ginger, did you hear about this?

485
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,200
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

486
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,200
I need my own office.

487
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,500
It's hard to do business and be credible
when I'm sharing with a Xerox machine.

488
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,100
Freddy Rumsen's office
has been vacant for some time.

489
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,200
I think I should have it.

490
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
It's yours.

491
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,900
Really?

492
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,900
You young women are very aggressive.

493
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,800
Oh, I didn't mean to be impolite.

494
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,000
No, it's cute.

495
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,500
There are 30 men out there
who didn't have the balls to ask me.

496
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,700
Oh, there you are.

497
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,200
Mr. Sterling, Miss Olsen,
this is my fianc? Dr. Greg Harris.

498
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,000
So you're the one
who got our Joanie, hmm?

499
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,100
Yes, I am.

500
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,900
You're a lucky man.

501
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,800
So nice to meet you. Congratulations.

502
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,900
And thank you again, Mr. Sterling.

503
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,900
It was a pleasure to meet you.

504
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
I have a dinner reservation,

505
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,100
and I don't think I'm going to make it.

506
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,300
Well, we do as well.

507
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,500
We're going to La Côte Basque.

508
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,100
I thought you hated French food.

509
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,500
There's a new chef.

510
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Good night, Ginger.

511
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,400
Pleasure to meet you, Greg.

512
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,000
Let me get my purse.

513
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,400
Mix me a drink, will you?

514
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,700
I don't know.

515
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,400
Isn't that what these guys do all day?

516
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,900
I've seen the movies.

517
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,000
Pretend like I'm your boss.

518
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,000
Donald Draper.

519
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,600
Okay, one drink.

520
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,800
Dr. Harris, are you
trying to examine me?

521
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,900
Maybe.

522
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,700
Not in here.

523
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,800
That Sterling guy knows
an awful lot about you.

524
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,200
I've been working here for nine years.

525
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,300
Greg, don't. It isn't my office.

526
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,100
It's okay.

527
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,300
No, I mean it.

528
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,000
Come on.

529
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,200
Greg, this isn't fun.

530
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,000
This is what you want, right?

531
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,800
Stop.

532
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,100
It's okay.

533
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,600
Greg, no!

534
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,700
Are you ready to go?

535
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,400
I don't want to miss our reservation.

536
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,500
No, of course not.

537
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,400
They're changing the guard
at Buckingham Palace.

538
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,600
Christopher Robin
went down with Alice.

539
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,300
Very good.

540
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,200
You look well, Roger.

541
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,900
Best babysitter in the world.

542
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,100
So.

543
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,200
I call to order a meeting

544
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,700
of the partners in the presence
of our attorney, Mr. Whitehouse.

545
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,200
Members attending:

546
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,000
Bertram Cooper, senior partner,

547
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Roger Sterling, senior partner,

548
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,600
and Alice Cooper, secretary-treasurer.

549
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,100
And Donald Draper, absent.

550
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,300
We are meeting to discuss the merger
with Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

551
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,100
the details of which
we've all had time to examine,

552
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,900
including Mr. Whitehouse.

553
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,300
Where's Mr. Draper?

554
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,500
Do you want me to go get a picture
of him so you can stare at it?

555
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,900
His 12% makes him
mathematically insignificant.

556
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,800
Still, I would like to know
what he thinks, wouldn't you?

557
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,800
He's very savvy.

558
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,700
Alice--

559
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
I'm sorry, I don't know
whose eyes to look at.

560
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,300
Where is Draper?

561
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
He took a business trip to California.

562
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,900
He's taking some time.

563
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,500
Marital troubles.
Don't write that down.

564
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,300
He stands to make
over half a million dollars.

565
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,700
Let's proceed, shall we?

566
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,100
That a '34 Sedan?

567
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,900
Mostly.

568
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,900
What'd you do to it?

569
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,200
Made some improvements.

570
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Got a '60 Nailhead,
??'39 LaSalle transmission,

571
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,300
and a '40 banjo rear end.

572
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,300
Two Fords and a Buick.

573
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,400
What happened here?

574
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,300
Dropped the spindle 4 inches.

575
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,500
You know anything about hot rods?

576
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,700
No, but I remember these.

577
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,300
I used to sell them.

578
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,900
Used.

579
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
All motor, no weight.

580
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,900
How fast does it go?

581
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,200
Well, that one does the quarter
in 11 seconds.

582
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,900
This one's going to scare people.

583
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,500
Yeah, the color on that one,
I've never seen anything like it.

584
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,800
I'm, uh, Kess.

585
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,300
That's my kid Doogie.

586
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,400
Dick.

587
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,000
The color is courtesy of Boy Wonder
of "Indian-no-place."

588
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
Walt. Indianapolis.

589
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,600
You guys need any help?

590
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,100
I'm looking for work.

591
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,500
Working on hot rods?

592
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,300
Don't people buy them?

593
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,500
There's a couple of custom shops,
and they do great,

594
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,800
but I came out here to get into it,
and I'm working at a bar.

595
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,900
He's an artist.

596
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,500
Built a car that looked just like it.

597
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,200
I'd like to see her race.

598
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Sunday.

599
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,900
Lions Drag Strip.

600
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Long Beach.

601
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,700
I'll look into that.

602
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,500
Mr. Sterling.

603
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,500
Yea.

604
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,100
Miss Cooper.

605
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,200
Yea.

606
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,700
Bertram Cooper,

607
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,200
Yea.

608
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,300
So we'll proceed.

609
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,500
Mr. Whitehouse will prepare a,
uh, counter-offer.

610
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Wonderful.

611
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,400
Meeting adjourned.

612
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Well done.

613
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,400
Look who just got richer.

614
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,100
This is good for you, too.

615
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,100
You have your children to think of.

616
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,800
I just have the one.

617
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,500
Really?

618
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,700
Hello, Joan.

619
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,700
Hello.

620
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,100
Have you heard from him today?

621
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,000
No.

622
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,900
Do you think it's odd?

623
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,400
I don't think about it at all.

624
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,400
Congratulations.

625
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,500
Thank you.

626
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,500
Your fianc? is so handsome.

627
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,600
He is.

628
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,100
He's the doctor you'd hope to see,
but only exists in movies.

629
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Thank you.

630
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,100
He's specializing in thoracic surgery.

631
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,600
It's very difficult.

632
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,000
And he volunteers
at Harlem Hospital Center,

633
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,600
stitching up Negro children.

634
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,700
Well, he's a keeper.

635
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,700
When's the wedding again?

636
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,900
Look who I found
protesting in the lobby.

637
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,900
Our man from the evening news.

638
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,500
Oh, welcome back.

639
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,300
Look at you.

640
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,500
What's different?

641
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,300
Nothing. How was Mississippi?

642
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,300
I think we made a difference.

643
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
And it was the adventure
of a lifetime.

644
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,400
Sheila dropped him 3 days into it.

645
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,100
There's a Bankers Box in the corner.

646
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,200
What the hell is this?

647
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,500
My new office.

648
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,800
What?

649
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,200
Why don't you just put on
Draper's pants while you're at it?

650
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,300
You have your own office? You?

651
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I'm the head of television,

652
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,900
and I spend the day
staring at an orangutan.

653
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,700
I have some unpacking to do.

654
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,100
Has anyone heard from Don?

655
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,600
Yes. He called.

656
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,100
He wants you to get back to work.

657
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,100
I'd get a new couch if I were you.

658
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,800
Thank you.

659
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,800
Do you know who I talk to about this?

660
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,800
I'll have it taken care of.

661
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,700
Christmas.

662
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm getting married at Christmas.

663
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,800
That's wonderful.

664
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,500
Hello.

665
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,900
Sally, can you come in here?

666
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,800
I'm in the living room.

667
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,400
Hello, Mommy.

668
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,800
I want to talk to you.

669
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,300
Okay.

670
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,700
I realize I haven't
been completely fair to you.

671
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,400
And if there is something you want,
I'd love to give it to you.

672
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,900
You're getting to be a big girl.

673
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,500
Someday you'll want something,
and I won't be able to give it to you.

674
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,700
Oh, Mommy, they're beautiful.

675
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,800
Thank you.

676
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,600
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

677
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,100
You're welcome.

678
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,900
Can we go now?

679
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,400
Do you have homework?

680
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,200
Arithmetic, but I can do it in the car.

681
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,400
Sally, now that you're a big girl,

682
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,700
I'm going to tell you something.

683
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,700
Your father and I
are having a disagreement,

684
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,300
and he went away.

685
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,200
Where did he go?

686
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm not sure.

687
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,400
When is he coming home?

688
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,100
I don't know.

689
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,200
I know it's hard to understand.

690
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,800
But I promise,
everything's going to be okay.

691
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,500
Okay.

692
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,400
Mommy, you're bleeding.

693
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,400
Go take those in the kitchen
and have a snack.

694
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,300
I'm going to change.

695
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,000
That's an ink blot.

696
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,900
You see what you want to see.

697
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,500
You don't have to pick them,
just put your palm on the deck.

698
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,700
Did you read it?

699
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,700
I did.

700
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,000
Reminded me of New York.

701
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,600
And it made me worry about you.

702
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,700
What about the cards?

703
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,900
Should I be worried?

704
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,700
It's all here.

705
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,600
You're definitely in a strange place.

706
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,800
But here is the sun.

707
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,800
- That can't be good.
- It is.

708
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,500
It's the end of the world.

709
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,300
It's the resurrection.

710
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,300
Do you want to know
what this means or not?

711
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,900
No, I don't.

712
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,100
I smell the ocean.

713
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,000
This is the one.

714
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Who's she?

715
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,100
She's the soul of the world.

716
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,700
She's in a very important spot here.

717
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,600
This is you,

718
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,200
what you are bringing to the reading.

719
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,100
She says you are part of the world.

720
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,200
Air, water.

721
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,200
Every living thing is connected to you.

722
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,600
It's a nice thought.

723
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,600
It is.

724
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,300
What does it mean?

725
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,300
It means...

726
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,700
the only thing keeping you from being
happy is the belief that you are alone.

727
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,400
What if that's true?

728
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,900
Then you can change.

729
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,000
People don't change.

730
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,900
I think she stands for wisdom.

731
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,700
As you live, you learn things.

732
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,000
Come in.

733
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:24,800
Hello.

734
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,900
Look at you, celebrating.

735
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,400
You getting a secretary?

736
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,800
Yes.

737
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,400
Well, she's in for it.

738
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,500
You should get some pictures in here

739
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,900
of your family
or some people or something.

740
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,600
I'm going to put up my campaigns.

741
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,500
??

742
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,800
He left it.

743
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,000
How the hell did you swing this?

744
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,400
I'm sleeping with Don.

745
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,600
It's really working out.

746
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,500
I haven't told anyone because it's
probably a formality at this point,

747
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,000
but Clearasil has pulled out.

748
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,100
How did that happen?

749
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,000
Sales have been great.

750
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,100
What about your father-in-law?

751
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,600
I guess I'm not doing my job.

752
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,700
I know that's not true.

753
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,900
Don will dance on my grave,
if he ever comes back.

754
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,500
Did something happen in Los Angeles?

755
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,700
Yes.

756
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,400
He disappeared.

757
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,100
He didn't even check out.

758
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,900
I almost called the police.

759
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,100
Well, why didn't you?
Maybe something happened.

760
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,000
Well, it didn't surprise me.

761
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,700
I know some things about him.

762
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,300
I'm not interested in gossip, Pete.

763
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
All I'm saying is
he may not be coming back.

764
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,500
He's done it before.

765
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,100
Whatever Don does or doesn't do,

766
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,500
I am sure it's with good reason.

767
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,500
Guess I should probably go home.

768
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,200
Congratulations.

769
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,600
Good night.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
