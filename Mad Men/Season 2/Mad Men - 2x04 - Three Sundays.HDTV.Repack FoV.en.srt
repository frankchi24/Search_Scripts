00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:39,772
But when the flesh
lusts against the spirit

2
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,110
and the spirit against the flesh,

3
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:46,547
the rational soul is supported
by the Cross of Christ.

4
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:50,210
Nor does it, when
seded by evil desires,

5
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,778
consent to evil doings, for it is
pierced by the nails of continence...

6
00:00:55,779 --> 00:01:00,782
and the fear of God. And, as at
all times, we must live worthily,

7
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:06,848
so at all times we must bear the Cross,
which for each one is rightly called His,

8
00:01:07,283 --> 00:01:08,890
for it is born by each one...

9
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:12,578
- I'm not feeling so good.
- That's because you're hung over.

10
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:15,855
- I can smell it.
- We have supper.

11
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,338
She's been fasting all
day. I need your help.

12
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:24,628
And as a rule, there is a greater danger
in the hidden betrayer than in the open foe.

13
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:31,294
- Is there a draft? I'll close it.
- No, Father.

14
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,417
Are you with one of these two?

15
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:35,868
No.

16
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:39,174
Okay, turn around.

17
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,393
If you see me again and I'm not smiling,
I don't think you're going to like it.

18
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,055
Now get back in there.

19
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:56,977
- Are you leaving?
- Just to get some air.

20
00:01:57,374 --> 00:01:59,481
You don't have to be polite.

21
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:02,651
I'm sorry. I didn't want
to lie to you in here.

22
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:05,264
- I'm Father Gill.
- I'm Peggy Olsen.

23
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,404
- Oh, Katherine Olsen's girl.
- Yes.

24
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,806
I'm having dinner at your sister's.

25
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:13,017
- Are you a new priest?
- I'm visiting.

26
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:18,667
So are you going to come back in?

27
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,111
Yes.

28
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,143
Hello.

29
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,713
Good morning, Caroline.

30
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:45,042
Yes. We're up.

31
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:47,991
Barbecue.

32
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:53,414
Right. Caroline, we
went over this. Steaks.

33
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:56,263
And the kids can eat hot dogs.

34
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:57,933
Cancel.

35
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:00,849
I'm sorry. What?

36
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:05,140
I don't know. Jell-O?

37
00:03:05,175 --> 00:03:07,672
Do you want me to
pick something else up?

38
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:09,007
Cancel.

39
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:14,810
Caroline, hold on a sec. I can't.

40
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:25,574
Caroline, I feel terrible about
this, but Don's not feeling well.

41
00:03:26,535 --> 00:03:29,571
No. I'm sorry.

42
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:35,328
The 22nd?
Isn't that Easter?

43
00:03:35,363 --> 00:03:39,036
Good. Bye-bye.

44
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,727
What's with you?

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,656
I don't know.

46
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:47,768
I had an amazing dream.

47
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:59,731
- You're always hogging the TV.
- I don't like baby stuff.

48
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:02,854
Get out.
We're- sleeping.

49
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,036
Get some Raisin Bran.
You can eat it in the den.

50
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,422
Out!

51
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:11,469
Out!

52
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:17,638
I should have locked the door.

53
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:40,733
- Here's number 2, sir.
- Thank you, Jeeves.

54
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:45,683
- Why are we in the living room?
- Because we live here.

55
00:04:49,858 --> 00:04:52,167
What did I say about the stereo?

56
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:54,774
I wasn't touching it.

57
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:59,384
- Bobby, I saw you do it.
- I didn't do it.

58
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,716
Go watch TV, both of you.

59
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:11,257
I love this song.

60
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,587
His voice is like silk,

61
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:17,411
and you can really hear the words.

62
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:21,384
He makes everything
sound like Christmas.

63
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,881
In high school I used to
love dancing to this song.

64
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:29,032
Come dance with me.

65
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:31,987
I thought we weren't
doing anything today.

66
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:34,336
Hurry. It's almost over.

67
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:45,520
I hate to think about your
reputation in high school.

68
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,440
Are you going to sit at the table?

69
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:03,972
- Gerry, could you get it?
- Jesus, Anita, I can't move.

70
00:06:04,007 --> 00:06:07,771
<i>Watch your language! And I don't care if
you have to lay there. Put your shoes on!</i>

71
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:11,040
- Little Gerry, get my shoes!
- Do you want me to get the door?

72
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:14,389
I can't reach my toes.
What am I supposed to do?

73
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,843
Hello, Father.

74
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,341
You're not leaving, are you?

75
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:27,284
Hello, Father. I'm sorry I'm late.
I went by Green-Wood to visit my son.

76
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,011
Well, I would love to meet him.

77
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:32,092
It's a cemetery.

78
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:36,418
Father, welcome.
Come before it gets cold.

79
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,274
Hello, Father.

80
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:41,093
I'm sorry I missed
Mass. My back is out.

81
00:06:41,128 --> 00:06:44,605
He hasn't been feeling well, but he
did his part. He watched the baby.

82
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,777
Well, I, uh, hope you feel better soon.

83
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:51,323
- We all do.
- I'm sorry. I got to lay down.

84
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:54,184
Oh, please, please.

85
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,221
Oh, come.

86
00:06:56,256 --> 00:07:00,491
Of course, Father. Right
this way. We have you here.

87
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:03,822
Gerard! Mikey! Wash your hands!

88
00:07:04,384 --> 00:07:06,690
They've disappeared.

89
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,996
Uh, don't wait for them.

90
00:07:11,803 --> 00:07:14,511
Father, would you
honor us and say grace?

91
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:16,697
Certainly. Why not?

92
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,760
O Lord, thank You for
this wonderful feast.

93
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:25,849
Thank you for these people
and this parish and their home.

94
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:34,031
That was beautiful. Are
you doing to say grace now?

95
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:40,727
Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts
we are about to receive from Thy bounty,

96
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:43,193
and make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.

97
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:46,259
- Through Christ our Lord.
- Amen.

98
00:07:59,816 --> 00:08:02,884
Monsignor says you have
a beautiful singing voice.

99
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:05,546
- And you play the harmonica?
- The guitar.

100
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:08,722
I actually learned how to play
the mandolin when I was in Rome.

101
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:11,668
- And soccer.
- Did you meet the Holy Father?

102
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:13,155
Not exactly.

103
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,377
It's kind of like being in Washington
and asking if you've met the President.

104
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:20,180
But you know when he's in the building.

105
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:24,511
- Well, aren't you going to have one?
- Should I?

106
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,443
Well, I'm not going to drink by myself.

107
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:30,341
- I'll get the sherry.
- I'll get it, Ma.

108
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:32,840
I've always wanted to go to Rome.

109
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:38,813
Ah, yes, well, Vatican City is one thing,
but then you realize you're in Italy.

110
00:08:38,848 --> 00:08:40,907
Peggy works in Manhattan.

111
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:43,312
Oh, really? What do you do, Peggy?

112
00:08:43,347 --> 00:08:48,028
She works on Madison Avenue. She comes
up with the words in advertisements.

113
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:49,956
They call it copywriting, Ma.

114
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:53,441
Father, I'm glad you're here. I
didn't know they knew what I did.

115
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:55,839
Oh, stop it. No, you
should see her work.

116
00:08:55,874 --> 00:08:59,123
Lipstick, reducing
programs, feminine products.

117
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:00,803
Mom, not in front of Father.

118
00:09:00,838 --> 00:09:03,389
She used to do her
presentations for us.

119
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:06,031
She uses Latin.

120
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,993
I'm sorry to do this,
but I really should go.

121
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:12,598
Oh. Look at that. Well,
where are you headed?

122
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,504
I'll give you a lift. I have a car.

123
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,627
To the 4th Avenue BMT?

124
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,931
It is such an honor to
have you in our house.

125
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:22,839
And I'm sorry the
chicken was overcooked.

126
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,713
The chicken was perfect,
and you know that.

127
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:27,288
Go get the Brownie.

128
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:28,570
Let me wrap up some cake.

129
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:31,407
Oh, thank you, but
no, thank you, Anita.

130
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:34,103
You've all really made me homesick.

131
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:37,097
Father, would you mind?

132
00:09:43,878 --> 00:09:47,364
- Say cheese.
- Cheese. Cheese.

133
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,225
Brooks, have you made any decision
about our immediate future?

134
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,200
Believe it or not, Daddy, Brooks
has other interests besides drinking.

135
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:06,754
That'll change.

136
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,442
- Would you stop scaring them?
- We're not scared.

137
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,164
Then how is it you've
been engaged for two months

138
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,076
and you're not running
around making wedding plans?

139
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:15,906
Because I told you.

140
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:18,685
We don't like the idea
of having a big wedding.

141
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,841
- It doesn't have to be big.
- We think it's silly.

142
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:24,987
You have to invite a bunch
of strangers to gawk at us

143
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:28,061
to somehow prove our
feelings for each other.

144
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:31,487
You know, it's embarrassing.

145
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:36,012
Brooks?

146
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,678
Whatever she wants.

147
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:42,199
Well, your mother wants a wedding.

148
00:10:42,616 --> 00:10:45,349
- Mommy had a wedding.
- I did.

149
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:50,943
Wearing that dress, my sister
and my mother fussing over me.

150
00:10:50,978 --> 00:10:54,932
It w the best I ever looked
in my life. The Pierre.

151
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:59,843
I was drunk, and I didn't
have a glass of champagne.

152
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:02,919
Gliding around in your father's arms.

153
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,919
You know how good a dancer he is.

154
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:10,256
Dancing with Grandpa.
I don't want you to miss that.

155
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:20,772
What are you getting?

156
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:24,643
I'll have the mussels
with garlic if you do.

157
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:27,769
That's sweet.

158
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:36,889
Thank you for the ride, Father.

159
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,821
- Peggy, wait.
- Yes?

160
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:46,174
I want to ask you about
something, and it's personal.

161
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,215
Okay.

162
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:54,721
I have the honor of delivering
the sermon next Sunday.

163
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,409
It's Palm Sunday. That's a biggie.
I mean, you're on deck for Easter.

164
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:04,325
And, well, uh, you said
you did presentations.

165
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:07,874
Can I run some things past you?

166
00:12:10,593 --> 00:12:14,160
I don't know what I could tell you.
You must do this all the time.

167
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:17,727
Well, I've done it, but your
monsignor is a tough act to follow.

168
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:22,777
I don't know that I'm your audience.

169
00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:27,219
You were leaving, and we ended
up having supper together,

170
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:30,764
and you're the only person in this
parish that knows about public speaking.

171
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:38,958
I find that if I'm prepared

172
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:43,907
and I have confidence in what I'm
selling, that kills the butterflies.

173
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:49,526
That's good. I'm prepared.
Do you have any other tips?

174
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:56,194
Well, pick somebody, and
make eye contact with them.

175
00:12:56,229 --> 00:13:00,436
You'd think it would make you
nervous, but it really focuses you.

176
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,629
Don't they have stuff thatou're
supposed to talk about?

177
00:13:06,664 --> 00:13:08,751
Yes, they have stuff.

178
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:12,860
Let's just say I'm covered
in the content department.

179
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,599
I can only speak for myself,

180
00:13:16,634 --> 00:13:20,457
but the sermon is the only
part of Mass that's in English,

181
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:23,508
and it's very hard to tell sometimes.

182
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:26,152
Maybe be simpler?

183
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:29,877
Give us a chance of understanding.

184
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:34,813
Thank you for the ride. I should
go. I really do have to work.

185
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:40,302
Idle hands. It's good to
know you. Have a great week.

186
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:07,746
- I hate my feet.
- I love your feet, Mommy.

187
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:11,871
Feet? I thought those were water skis.

188
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:17,272
Stop it. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

189
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:24,837
- Great. You broke it.
- I didn't mean to.

190
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:28,065
You're being wild in
the house. It's late.

191
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,950
Everybody brush your
teeth and go to bed.

192
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:34,145
- I'm hungry.
- You're going to bed.

193
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,501
We didn't have any dinner.

194
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:42,325
It's 7:30.

195
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:47,006
Okay. Come downstairs.
I'll make you some grilled cheese.

196
00:14:47,476 --> 00:14:50,691
- Go. Go. Go.
- Come on.

197
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,750
And my wife says, "Duck and cover. "

198
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:15,029
Well, look at this.

199
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:19,490
- Marty, meet Vicki.
- Hello, Marty.

200
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:22,172
I've heard so much about you,

201
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,086
but you didn't tell me
about his wonderful head.

202
00:15:25,121 --> 00:15:28,522
- What about it?
- Ooh, someone thinks a lot.

203
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:30,854
Well, look at that.
It's love at first rub.

204
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:34,359
My head has been known
to make wishes come true.

205
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:37,427
Don't get up.

206
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:39,724
This is Marty
Hasselbach, from Gorton's.

207
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,203
Nice to meet you. Roger Sterling.

208
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:42,778
We were due to meet tomorrow anyway.

209
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,867
- Love that frozen scrod.
- Thank you.

210
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,605
I'm Vicki, Marty's wife.

211
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:51,480
Aren't you a lucky man?

212
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:54,145
Yes. Yes, I am.

213
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,001
We were just discussing the male head.

214
00:15:57,481 --> 00:15:58,829
Is that right?

215
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:01,022
I like the Yul Brynner look.

216
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:02,680
She does seem to.

217
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:05,066
I keep threatening to
shave him one morning.

218
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:07,980
Just hop in the shower
and take it all off.

219
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,431
Is that right?

220
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:12,637
- How long have you two been married?
- Five years.

221
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:17,319
Second time around. That explains it.

222
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:22,091
It's nice to meet you. I
hope to see you both tomorrow.

223
00:16:22,834 --> 00:16:24,817
A pleasure.

224
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:33,982
<i>Mrs. Draper, Mrs. Barrett
is here at my desk.</i>

225
00:16:35,772 --> 00:16:38,514
No. Of course. Send her in.

226
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:44,222
Mrs. Barrett, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

227
00:16:44,257 --> 00:16:46,890
- May I take your coat?
- No, thank you.

228
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:51,781
I'm not sure how they do it
in show business, but around

229
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:54,159
he we have this nifty gadget
called an appointment book.

230
00:16:54,194 --> 00:16:55,713
I was in the neighborhood.

231
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,624
What did Jimmy do now,
ask Eleanor Roosevelt

232
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,500
how fast her husband ran
the hundred-yard dash?

233
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,537
- How are you?
- Busy.

234
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,211
I have an idea for a television show.

235
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:10,947
Congratulations.

236
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:13,297
Is it too early to have a drink?

237
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,264
- Let me call for some ice.
- No need.

238
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:19,594
How do I make this
happen? Where do I go?

239
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:21,124
What is it?

240
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:25,107
Everyone loves Candid Camera,right?
Hidden camera situations.

241
00:17:25,142 --> 00:17:30,080
Only Jimmy's the host, and
he's Jimmy, you know? Not nice.

242
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:35,603
It's derivative, with a twist.
That's what they're looking for.

243
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,435
It's called Grin and Barrett.

244
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,951
- That's cute.
- I thought it up all by myself.

245
00:17:41,986 --> 00:17:44,632
ABC's sick about losingCandid Camera.

246
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:47,273
But you'd have to get Jimmy
out of his contract with Utz.

247
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:52,006
I thought about that. It's exclusive,
but they could come on as sponsors.

248
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,553
Show needs a national sponsor.
Utz won't do you any good.

249
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:59,335
You're a pessimist.
They could let him out.

250
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,613
They should want to keep Jimmy happy.

251
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:03,567
They don't care.

252
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:08,571
But they could be told that
their spots would have more punch,

253
00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:12,660
wherever they air, if Jimmy's
on a hit television show.

254
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:16,479
That is very good advice.

255
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:34,311
Will you sell the show for me?

256
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:38,142
I'm not interested in doing that.

257
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:41,982
But I can talk to the Schillings.

258
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,741
What's this?

259
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:54,110
I was thinking how I could
avoid getting bored with you.

260
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,914
Bobbi, I have work.

261
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:06,935
Bullshit.

262
00:19:09,103 --> 00:19:10,803
It's good.

263
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:15,294
But we should sell them on the mascot
first. The jingle's going to be a cutie.

264
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:19,842
Hasselbach's at 3, right?
Is he bringing the missus?

265
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:23,119
Uh, Mary, that'll be all for now.

266
00:19:28,423 --> 00:19:30,036
Um, Roger,

267
00:19:30,553 --> 00:19:33,318
there is a Mrs. Hasselbach,

268
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,667
and that's not her.

269
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:40,848
I see. That makes sense.

270
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:44,857
I've got her number if you want it.
I've got lots of numbers.

271
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:48,159
No. That's okay.

272
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:50,875
Keep up the good work.

273
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:54,533
Daddy!

274
00:19:57,574 --> 00:20:00,570
- You need to shave.
- You need to shave.

275
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:04,517
Some people weren't so good today.

276
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:06,271
What happened?

277
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,610
Bobby broke the record player.

278
00:20:08,645 --> 00:20:10,957
The repair call is going to be $18.

279
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:13,996
9 if you want to put it in
your car and drag it over there.

280
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:15,566
I don't.

281
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,960
When I asked him about it,
he said he didn't do it.

282
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:21,298
He lied to my face.

283
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,640
- Where is he?
- In his room.

284
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:42,297
Mommy says you broke
the hi-fi. I believe her.

285
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:44,251
Don't do that again.

286
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,502
I won't.

287
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,283
That's it?

288
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:01,563
I said to him "Wait till your father gets
home" and that's what he gets "Go to sleep"

289
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:03,005
He knows he did something wrong.

290
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,291
First the shenanigans with the washing
machine, and now the record player.

291
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:10,590
Don, you have to do something.
He needs a spanking.

292
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:13,007
How else is he going to learn the
difference between right and wrong?

293
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,177
That's not the way it works.

294
00:21:14,212 --> 00:21:17,746
You think you'd be the man you are
today if your father didn't hit you?

295
00:21:19,423 --> 00:21:21,806
Can I get something to eat?

296
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:36,013
- You left this by the bed.
- I'll do it.

297
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,320
Draper residence.

298
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:48,498
<i>Good. You're there. It's Duck.</i>

299
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,602
Sunday morning. Where else would I be?

300
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:52,637
Shel Keneally called
me late last night.

301
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:55,522
American Airlines already scheduled
a bunch of pitches for this week.

302
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:57,585
Why are we on the calendar
for two weeks from now?

303
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,275
<i>We're not anymore. I got
us Good Friday first thing.</i>

304
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,820
Most of the team's already
here. The rest are on their way.

305
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:10,488
- Hello?
- Let me look.

306
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:11,373
It hurts! It hurts!

307
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:15,843
I walk out of the room for 10 seconds?
He needs to go to the emergency room.

308
00:22:15,978 --> 00:22:17,993
That was Duck Phillips on the phone.

309
00:22:17,994 --> 00:22:19,452
American Airlines moved
up their presentation.

310
00:22:19,487 --> 00:22:21,111
- So?
- So I have to go in.

311
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:26,076
Damn it. One child in the emergency
room is enough to deal with.

312
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,973
- Take Sally.
- Send Sally to Francine's.

313
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:33,217
It's Palm Sunday. I am not about
to impose on Francine today.

314
00:22:34,675 --> 00:22:37,554
I want to go with Daddy.

315
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:03,445
- Hello, Father Gill. Come in. Come in.
- Father, welcome.

316
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,656
I'm terribly sorry, Anita,
Mrs. Olsen. I can't stay.

317
00:23:06,691 --> 00:23:08,497
- Oh, no.
- Oh, that's terrible.

318
00:23:08,562 --> 00:23:12,159
We have Tom, Roberta Callahan,
Mrs. O'Neill, Mrs. Casey.

319
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:15,423
Yes, I'm afraid Mrs. Marchetti
has taken a turn for the worse.

320
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:18,102
- I hope you'll forgive me.
- Oh, that poor woman.

321
00:23:18,137 --> 00:23:21,215
- Let me fix you a paper plate.
- Peggy didn't make it?

322
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,817
Oh, she's sick.

323
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,348
Oh, well, could you give her ts?
It is a copy of my sermon.

324
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:30,696
She helped me quite a bit, and
I would love for her to see it.

325
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:33,974
- Peggy helped you write something?
- Just some tips, really.

326
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:38,070
It was very good. I felt like I was
the only one you were talking to.

327
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:41,427
Well, thank you.
Again, I'm sorry.

328
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:50,305
It's so nice he's taken
an interest in her.

329
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,226
Come, let's eat.

330
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:12,542
Mr. Phillips and the others
are in the conference room.

331
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,760
I see you've brought a little helper.

332
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:17,403
Betty had her hands full today.

333
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:20,216
Sally, be good for Miss Holloway.

334
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,994
Keep her away from the paper cutter.

335
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,471
Friday morning, the American
Airlines folks will join us at 10.

336
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:34,119
Roger will handle the introductions.
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Sterling,

337
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:36,733
creative to the right, accounts
to the left, starting with myself,

338
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:39,053
then the American Airlines
people, then Campbell.

339
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:41,593
Pete, you're next to
our man Shel Keneally.

340
00:24:41,628 --> 00:24:43,607
There will be one for each of them.

341
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:46,187
We can't get cordovan by Friday,
so we're going with maroon.

342
00:24:46,222 --> 00:24:49,755
Campbell will run the show. He has a list
of every ad we need in the presentation.

343
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,972
Art department needs to
make sure that every image

344
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:54,189
we use in a comp is an
airplane that American has.

345
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:56,225
No cutting and pasting
planes from other ads.

346
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,812
They may all look
alike to us, but-

347
00:24:57,847 --> 00:24:59,661
Why are you here?

348
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:03,246
I'm, uh, head of the
televion department.

349
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:06,868
We have 90 minutes to
present. I'll do the setup-

350
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:09,801
the history of American Airlines
up to and including the crash.

351
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:12,995
I'll tee up creative with what
research says travelers are

352
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:16,189
waiting to hear from American,
and then, Don, you do what you do.

353
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:18,814
Maybe you could give us a little peek.

354
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:21,400
I'm not ready to do that yet.

355
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:29,442
I say we show all three campaigns,
eliminate all possible objections.

356
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:31,155
Something for everybody.

357
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,219
Remember, this isn't the work
we have to run in the end.

358
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:36,958
This is about winning these guys over.

359
00:25:37,755 --> 00:25:41,990
Creative...
In my office.

360
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,153
You have big ones.

361
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:48,683
My mommy has big ones, too,

362
00:25:48,718 --> 00:25:52,311
and I'm going to have
big ones when I grow up.

363
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,887
I don't care if we're just
selling a point of view, but we

364
00:26:02,888 --> 00:26:05,634
have to commit to one thing.
They don't like wiggle room.

365
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:08,210
They like to see us blowing
up bridges behind us.

366
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:11,191
These are the boards for the
60-second television spots.

367
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:13,526
Music you can talk over.

368
00:26:14,228 --> 00:26:19,324
Stewardesses. We're going to bookend
every spot with the plane taking

369
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:24,421
off and landing up, down, no problems,
everything okay, every commercial.

370
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:30,613
Where's that list
Duck's buddy Shel gave us

371
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:33,284
with all the things that
make American different?

372
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:36,302
What's that?

373
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:40,176
The ad you asked for
to recruit stewardesses.

374
00:26:41,193 --> 00:26:44,980
It equates what should be a glamorous
job with being a waitress in a tin can.

375
00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:48,768
Where's the bar of soap, the ticket
sleeves? Who's doing the in-flight menu?

376
00:26:48,803 --> 00:26:52,228
I think it's the best
menu I've ever written.

377
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:55,336
This is in French. How
do I know it's right?

378
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:57,182
It's right.

379
00:26:57,217 --> 00:26:58,958
Make up a chef.

380
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,576
Peggy, did you pick
out a china pattern yet?

381
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,125
Did you find the one
from the Queen Mary?

382
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,937
Yes. But there needs to be a decision
if we're doing anything to the logo.

383
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:09,490
I don't know.

384
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:14,633
We got a lot of bricks, but I don't
know what the building looks like.

385
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,744
So how are you, Vicki?

386
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:40,018
I'm in a very good mood.

387
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:48,633
Well, I hate to sound remedial, but I
haven't done this since I was in the Navy.

388
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:52,327
- Been with a girl?
- No. Not that.

389
00:27:52,886 --> 00:27:56,806
Oh, don't worry. The prices may have
changed, but the menu's still the same.

390
00:27:56,998 --> 00:28:00,816
Well, your invoice ran across my desk.

391
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:15,541
Look at you.

392
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:23,494
The menu hasn't changed.

393
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:28,135
Is it open for negotiation?

394
00:28:28,694 --> 00:28:30,934
I don't want to ruin the magic.

395
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:34,431
How about double plus carfare?

396
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,262
And I'll assume you live far away.

397
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:40,471
That'll be $100.

398
00:28:40,837 --> 00:28:43,391
But I want everything I want.

399
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,405
Isn't that the perfect thing to say?

400
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:04,111
That's not so bad, is it?

401
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,995
I have to warn you,
I'm not in great health.

402
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,968
Don't believe what they say.

403
00:29:16,384 --> 00:29:19,192
No one dies doing this.

404
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:25,706
Are you resting? Everybody's resting.

405
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:31,640
- No. I'm thinking.
- Let's have a conversation.

406
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,813
Is that your maid?

407
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,957
- No. She's my girlfriend.
- Do you kiss her?

408
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:47,024
- Sometimes.
- Do you lay on top of her?

409
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:53,514
You know what, Sally? Your daddy's
going to be angry if I don't do my work.

410
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,623
Oh. Okay.

411
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:07,132
Just a minute, girls.
It's almost your turn.

412
00:30:11,616 --> 00:30:14,188
You know, we'll get to go
anywhere American flies.

413
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:15,763
Familiarization.

414
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:18,639
We'll have to rent another floor.
We'll all have our own offices.

415
00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:22,177
Do you realize we will get
to pick out the stewardesses?

416
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,690
Okay.

417
00:30:27,256 --> 00:30:31,542
Son of a bitch. *****

418
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:37,091
You there...

419
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,745
Chewing your cud.

420
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,626
It's one thing to be unladylike.
It's another to treat our

421
00:30:44,627 --> 00:30:49,473
office like a subway platform.
Pack up your Wrigley's and go home.

422
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:54,334
How could it be my gum?
My gum's in my mouth.

423
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,178
******

424
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:00,966
Thank you for getting him
out of here for the day.

425
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:05,500
Lose the gum then get yourself some
dinner. He won't rember firing you.

426
00:31:17,178 --> 00:31:21,869
American Airlines is not about
the past any more than America is.

427
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:26,162
Ask not about Cuba.
Ask not about the bomb.

428
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:29,257
We're going to the moon.
Throw everything out.

429
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:30,789
Everything?

430
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:35,315
There is no such thing as
American history, only a frontier.

431
00:31:36,424 --> 00:31:38,961
That crash happened to somebody else.

432
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:42,464
It's not about apologies for what
happened. It's about those sen men

433
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:45,933
in the room on Friday and what
airline they are going to be running.

434
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:48,388
So what does that mean?

435
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:51,997
Let's pretend we know
what 1963 looks like.

436
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,093
Jesus, Draper, make a decision.

437
00:32:05,128 --> 00:32:07,424
What's that leave us
with, introductions?

438
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:10,029
If I can't mention the crash,
there's no preamble at all.

439
00:32:10,064 --> 00:32:14,952
Let it go. Our job is to bend down
the branch. Let him pick the fruit.

440
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:38,983
That champagne is probably near frozen.

441
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,063
I'm meeting a friend.

442
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:44,476
You know what I really want?

443
00:32:44,905 --> 00:32:48,840
- Is there something we left out?
- Have dinner with me?

444
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,238
I told you I'm meeting a friend.

445
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:54,697
I'll pay for his meeting, too.

446
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:59,180
You wouldn't think dinner would
be pushing it on the extras.

447
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:02,416
Have you been to Lutce yet?

448
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:05,618
I have. I think you'd like it.

449
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,168
I've got it.

450
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:13,777
It's great, but they're cheeky.

451
00:33:13,812 --> 00:33:18,454
They started with this prix fixe
menu at lunch. 8.50 for lunch.

452
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,881
And they have these wines.
What kind of wine do you like?

453
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:25,264
I don't know. Red?

454
00:33:25,552 --> 00:33:28,756
They're going to make you
be more specific than that.

455
00:33:30,554 --> 00:33:34,339
We can walk, if you
don't mind a little rain.

456
00:33:34,374 --> 00:33:39,036
You know what? I love the sound
of cabs whooshing in the water.

457
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:41,754
Shall we?

458
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:46,974
Isn't this a nice time?

459
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:49,443
Absolutely.

460
00:34:00,964 --> 00:34:03,542
She's here on a Sunday,
and I respect that,

461
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:06,121
but you know she's earning
more than all of us.

462
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:12,789
Come up. Oh, up. Up. Oh...

463
00:34:17,534 --> 00:34:21,432
Good night, ladies.
Thanks for babysitting.

464
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:26,988
I'm going home. Be good, Peaches.

465
00:34:29,499 --> 00:34:32,083
Your sister wants to talk.

466
00:34:33,683 --> 00:34:35,195
Hey, Pegs.

467
00:34:35,834 --> 00:34:37,378
Okay.

468
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:41,383
Oh, it was good. He gave us a
copy of his sermon to give to you.

469
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:45,266
Okay, so long.

470
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:48,471
It's nice that he can get to
know her without all her troubles.

471
00:34:48,506 --> 00:34:51,052
She's such a beautiful young girl.

472
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:55,049
She does whatever she feels
like with no regard at all.

473
00:34:55,413 --> 00:34:58,333
You're too easy on her. You know that.

474
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:01,309
Is Gerry warming up the car?

475
00:35:58,282 --> 00:36:01,286
Shel Keneally was fired this morning.

476
00:36:02,843 --> 00:36:04,571
What?

477
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,711
The rest are on their way in.

478
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:10,252
- What's going on?
- It's over.

479
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:12,885
So why are they coming in?

480
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,441
Because they have to.

481
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,061
And we have to deliver
a stillborn baby.

482
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:23,992
Mr. Phillips, the gentlemen
are here from American Airlines.

483
00:36:24,027 --> 00:36:26,036
Send them in.

484
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:40,508
In nomine patris et filii
et spiritus sancti, amen.

485
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:44,442
In the name of the Father,
Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.

486
00:36:45,096 --> 00:36:50,708
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's
been two weeks since my last confession.

487
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,796
I took something that
didn't belong to me.

488
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,957
Go on.

489
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:02,822
I was in the Laundromat, and I...

490
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:07,017
took some coins off the
machine and used them.

491
00:37:07,796 --> 00:37:13,333
I took the Lord's name in
vain three times, and...

492
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:18,949
and I am so angry, Father.

493
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:24,205
I am so angry at my little sister.

494
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:28,381
She's causing my mother so much pain.

495
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:33,198
She had a child out of wedlock.

496
00:37:34,094 --> 00:37:37,894
She seduced a married
man. It's a terrible sin,

497
00:37:37,895 --> 00:37:41,695
and she acts like it
didn't even happen.

498
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:46,479
And I hate her for it.

499
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:51,593
And I feel so guilty about it.

500
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:56,895
But everyone keeps falling all
over themselves trying to help her.

501
00:37:58,814 --> 00:38:01,735
And she goes on like nothing happened.

502
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,166
Nothing at all.

503
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:11,886
What about me, Father?

504
00:38:12,775 --> 00:38:14,767
My troubles?

505
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:18,953
What about me being good? For what?

506
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:25,421
I understand it's difficult. You
know it's not your place to judge.

507
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:28,815
God sees your goodness.

508
00:38:29,077 --> 00:38:33,282
- It doesn't feel that way, Father.
- Try to trust God on this.

509
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:37,747
You will get your reward in heaven.

510
00:38:38,121 --> 00:38:42,230
God loves you, and He knows
that you love your sister.

511
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,738
I do.

512
00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:49,331
Say three Hail Marys
and two Our Fathers.

513
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:55,271
And try to forgive your sister.
She's not as strong as you are.

514
00:38:56,373 --> 00:38:59,830
Would you like to make
your Act of Contrition?

515
00:39:01,957 --> 00:39:07,235
O my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee.

516
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:12,514
I detest all my sins because
I dread the loss of heaven...

517
00:39:23,007 --> 00:39:27,115
Cooper walked them to the
elevator. They acted impressed.

518
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:43,302
I just can't believe it.

519
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:48,125
Here. You should have this.

520
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:55,728
No regrets, fellas. We were in
it. That's the important thing.

521
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:57,272
It's heaking.

522
00:39:57,307 --> 00:40:00,552
But still, good work, Don.

523
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:09,028
Come on.

524
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:13,664
We hired him to bring in new
business, not lose old business.

525
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:16,328
Don't you love the chase?

526
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:22,130
Sometimes it doesn't work out.
Those are the stakes.

527
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:24,628
But when it does work out...

528
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:31,251
it's like having that first cigarette.
Head gets all dizzy.

529
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:35,637
Your heart pounds, knees go weak.

530
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:37,671
Remember that?

531
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,708
Old business is just old business.

532
00:40:52,508 --> 00:40:55,809
- You're home early.
- It's Good Friday.

533
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:58,333
How did it go?

534
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:00,782
It didn't.

535
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,821
Bobby, stop playing with the robot.

536
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:13,356
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

537
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:17,902
How was your day?

538
00:41:17,937 --> 00:41:22,888
My father called. He's doing better.
He and William played golf yesterday.

539
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:25,816
William made a show of paying for it.

540
00:41:26,328 --> 00:41:29,364
- Bobby, what did I just say?
- It was accident.

541
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:33,234
You don't listen. Don, do something.

542
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:41,809
Is that what you wanted?

543
00:41:45,177 --> 00:41:48,246
You take no responsibility for
anything that goes on in this house.

544
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:52,677
I pay the bills, put clothes
on your back, your damn stables.

545
00:41:52,712 --> 00:41:57,074
Don't you dare. I'm here all
day, alone with them, outnumbered.

546
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:59,205
What about Carla? Doesn't she count?

547
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,266
It's not her job to raise our children!

548
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:04,626
I'm here, and then you come
home and get to be the hero.

549
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:07,952
You want me to bring home
what I got at the office today?

550
00:42:07,987 --> 00:42:10,350
I'll put you through that window.

551
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:21,109
<i>Brush your teeth. It's bedtime.</i>

552
00:42:35,397 --> 00:42:38,987
- Bobby, it's not a good time.
- I'm sorry.

553
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:42,428
It's okay.

554
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,077
Dads get mad sometimes.

555
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:50,324
Did your daddy get mad?

556
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:53,169
He did.

557
00:42:53,606 --> 00:42:56,917
What did your daddy look like?

558
00:42:58,278 --> 00:43:01,678
Like me, but bigger.

559
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:05,598
What did he like to eat?

560
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,910
Ham.

561
00:43:12,686 --> 00:43:16,324
And this candy.
It tasted like violets.

562
00:43:18,736 --> 00:43:22,448
Had a beautiful purple
and silver package.

563
00:43:25,232 --> 00:43:27,680
What did he do?

564
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,767
I told you, he was a farmer.

565
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:35,608
But he died.

566
00:43:36,872 --> 00:43:39,471
A long time ago.

567
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:45,368
We have to get you a new daddy.

568
00:43:48,007 --> 00:43:50,719
Come here.

569
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,604
You have nothing to say?

570
00:44:25,736 --> 00:44:28,908
What do you want to hear?

571
00:44:29,398 --> 00:44:32,825
Something. Anything.

572
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,003
How about you're going to help
raise these children, not be one?

573
00:44:38,038 --> 00:44:40,795
Bets, you do whatever you want.

574
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,565
It's not about what I do.

575
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:49,299
He's a little kid.

576
00:44:50,778 --> 00:44:54,215
My father beat the hell out of me.

577
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:59,796
All it did was make me fantasize
about the day I could murder him.

578
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:06,572
I didn't know that.

579
00:45:06,607 --> 00:45:10,403
And I wasn't half as good as Bobby.

580
00:45:56,651 --> 00:45:59,076
- Happy Easter, Peggy.
- Hello, Father.

581
00:45:59,111 --> 00:46:03,337
I read your sermon. I liked
it. It was very colloquial.

582
00:46:03,372 --> 00:46:06,553
You were very helpful.

583
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:16,545
These kids.

584
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:25,349
For the little one.
