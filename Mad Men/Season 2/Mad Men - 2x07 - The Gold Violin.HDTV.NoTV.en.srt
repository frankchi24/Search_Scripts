1
00:00:36,115 --> 00:00:38,925
Mad Men 2x7
<i>The Gold Violin</i>

2
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:00,874
Afraid you'll fall in love?

3
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,649
Something like that.

4
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:07,069
Well, I can see you have good taste.
This is the one.

5
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:09,502
1962 Coupe de Ville.

6
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:11,490
Does everything but make breakfast.

7
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,244
- What are you in now?
- I had a Dodge.

8
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:18,213
Those are wonderful
if you want to get somewhere.

9
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:20,374
This is for when
you've already arrived.

10
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:23,584
- Is that right?
- Of course, someone like you,

11
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:26,145
you don't need to see yourself
in a Cadillac.

12
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:28,715
You're walking about
in one every day.

13
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:32,351
How'd you like your car
to look like that?

14
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,332
Look at you.

15
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:36,427
I bet you'd be as comfortable
in one of these

16
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,267
as you would in your own skin.

17
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,990
Wayne Kirkby. Do you have a card?

18
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:49,612
Sterling Cooper.
Did Roger Sterling send you?

19
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,193
Yes.

20
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:54,717
Let me go and get
the keys, Mr. Draper.

22
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,267
- Don't you want to hold on to these?
- I don't know. The 49 rattled.

23
00:02:20,066 --> 00:02:23,021
This is the 1950 model.
It's quite different under the hood.

24
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:26,075
Don't talk to me.
Talk to him. It's his money.

25
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:27,467
I'm just here to make sure

26
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:30,116
you don't shake his hand
and take his fingers.

27
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:34,344
Charlie, this car is two years old
with only 25,000 miles on it.

28
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,284
It's what you want.

29
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:40,867
This must be Mrs. Wheatley.

30
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:42,832
No.

31
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,277
Why don't you sit in it again?

32
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:53,668
You two talk.

33
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:57,566
Can I help you, ma'am?

34
00:02:58,235 --> 00:02:59,808
Are you Donald Draper?

35
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,647
Yes, I am.

36
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:04,523
If it's about my circular,
many of the models are gone,

37
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,393
but, uh, I'm sure we
can find you something.

38
00:03:07,558 --> 00:03:09,653
I'm not here to buy a car.

39
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:13,238
You're a hard man to find.

40
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,958
Excuse me?

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,444
You're not Don Draper.

42
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,330
Mr. Draper?

43
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:23,343
Mr. Draper.

44
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,578
Everything okay?

45
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:26,985
Yes.

46
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,963
Let me take you for a ride.

47
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:31,295
No.

48
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:33,643
Thank you.

49
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,168
I don't hear that a lot.

50
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:37,768
Well.

51
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:39,767
Have a good day.

52
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:55,133
Good afternoon, Miss Segal.

53
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:56,697
Mr. Sterling.

54
00:03:57,656 --> 00:04:00,325
- Is your boss in?
- No, but he will be.

55
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:02,473
Where'd you get that sweater?

56
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:04,954
I want to make sure
my daughter never buys it.

57
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,167
Klein's. I doubt
your daughter shops there.

58
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,878
Union Square, right?
Is that where you live?

59
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,505
I've told you all you have
to do is look at my file.

60
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:15,257
That's cheating.

61
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:20,416
- How was your lunch, Mr. Draper?
- Good.

62
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:22,586
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.

63
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:24,758
Get Mr. Phillips.

64
00:04:24,878 --> 00:04:27,352
Mr. Draper,
Mrs. Barrett called again.

65
00:04:27,646 --> 00:04:29,522
- Did she leave a message?
- No.

66
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,649
Shall I tell Mr. Phillips
you returned?

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,527
Yes.

68
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,740
I'll bet she suffers
in silence out there,

69
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,610
hoping you'll notice her.

70
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:44,119
I don't think she cries at night
from lack of attention.

71
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,118
Wait till she finds out
about your Cadillac.

72
00:04:46,238 --> 00:04:48,948
She'll be waiting naked
right in front of this window.

73
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:53,922
Now you're thinking about her.
Didn't you go see Wayne?

74
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,747
I'm going to eliminate
your objections right away.

75
00:04:57,867 --> 00:04:59,726
First of all, you can afford it.

76
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:02,617
Do you know how invigorating it is

77
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,087
to go in and write
a check for $6,500

78
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:06,386
and not care?

79
00:05:06,613 --> 00:05:07,613
Secondly,

80
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,198
not to get too deep
before the cocktail hour,

81
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:12,426
but, uh, do I need to remind you

82
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,496
of the finite nature of life?

83
00:05:16,127 --> 00:05:17,230
<i>Mr. Phillips.</i>

84
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:19,822
Send him in.

85
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:23,868
Like the song says, enjoy yourself.
It's later than you think.

86
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:25,410
Martinson Coffee.

87
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:26,870
Martinson's.

88
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,038
They changed it.

89
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,800
Change it back.

90
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,417
Jim Van Dyke told the people
at Grey they're under review.

91
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:34,002
So Grey must be scraling.

92
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:36,020
It's hard for them
to do a lot of new work.

93
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,431
They just redesigned labels,
displays, and dropped the S,

94
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:41,552
but they have some kids
working on print and TV.

95
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:44,764
- Are they better than our kids?
- We'll find out.

96
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,307
You're welcome.

97
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:49,741
I spent Saturday birding with that man,
and by birding I mean sitting on a stump

98
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:51,880
with a pair of binoculars, whispering.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,855
Did you see anything unusual?

100
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:56,408
A refrigerator floating in a pond.

101
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,657
<i>Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith are here.</i>

102
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,029
Just a minute.

103
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,272
Did you let them stay up late?

104
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,310
I'd love to hear this.

105
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,261
If I fill you full
of any more confidence,

106
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:08,287
you'll burst.

107
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:15,758
You don't dance,
or you don't dance with me?

108
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:17,450
Leave her alone. Let's go.

109
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,720
Heard you're gonna knock 'em dead.

110
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,890
Look, Don, it's pretty
clear why we're here.

111
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,768
You want to know
how our generation feels.

112
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:36,762
So, I get this letter
from my friend back in Michigan.

113
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:38,632
He's still in school, man,

114
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,571
and it's got this, I don't know,
60-page rant in it.

115
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:44,573
So dig it.

116
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:47,264
"We would replace power"

117
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:50,385
"rooted in possession,
privilege, or circumstance,"

118
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:52,136
"by power and uniqueness"

119
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,306
"rooted in love, reflectiveness,"

120
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,544
"reason, and creativity."

121
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:59,203
That's a beautiful sentiment.

122
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:01,388
Does your friend know
what you do for a living?

123
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:03,701
Yeah, there was
a shitty note with it,

124
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:06,701
but this whole concept is deep.

125
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:15,108
"Students for a Democratic Society."

126
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:17,265
That's a hell of a focus group.

127
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:19,192
It's how our generation feels.

128
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:20,693
It is what it is.

129
00:07:24,181 --> 00:07:25,431
It's idealistic.

130
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,500
That's nice.

131
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,809
Your generation wants to talk
about that newly designed can

132
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:32,257
and the premium beans,

133
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:34,333
but we don't want to be
told what we should do

134
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,624
or how we should act.

135
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:37,377
We just want to be.

136
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:41,380
You just want to be
selling Martinson's Coffee?

137
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,067
Just listen to this.

138
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:52,460
<i>Comme ça.</i>

139
00:07:54,178 --> 00:07:55,828
So, the thought is

140
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:58,873
every maternity ward will get a visit
from a registered nurse

141
00:07:58,993 --> 00:08:01,386
with a doll and a crate of Pampers,

142
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:05,029
and she will extol their virtues,
which are many.

143
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:06,562
What did Draper say?

144
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,121
He liked it,

145
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:10,872
but he said the same thing
he keeps saying.

146
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,934
I can't get them
to lower the price.

147
00:08:13,054 --> 00:08:15,432
Do you know the years of R&D
P&G put into this?

148
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:19,222
Besides, they're worth it. No boiling,
no diaper service, no plastic pants.

149
00:08:19,342 --> 00:08:21,587
And the greatest benefit of all,
you can throw them away.

150
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:24,823
10 cents a piece, you kind of think
you should reuse them.

151
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,956
Mr. Draper went over these ideas

152
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:30,971
and had thoughts he would
like you all to discuss.

153
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:35,100
Well, it's 5:00. Are we going out?

154
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:37,353
I don't know, sweetheart. Maybe.

155
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:40,184
- I'll take those papers.
- Good night, Miss Olsen.

156
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:43,354
Would you mind
helping us clean the mess up?

157
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,042
I'm meeting with Cooper tomorrow.

158
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:48,864
He said he wants
to see me and only me.

159
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,216
Isn't that from West Side Story?

160
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,875
You know he's going to
ask you about the picture.

161
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:56,534
- What picture?
- Some new painting.

162
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:58,915
He calls people in
to see what they think.

163
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:03,170
No, I think we're going to discuss
expanding the television department.

164
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:05,213
I heard it cost $10,000.

165
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:08,759
How does everybody know about this?
Are you making it up?

166
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,680
Last year, Harry went up to the roof
looking for cosmonauts.

167
00:09:13,676 --> 00:09:16,058
- Has anyone seen it?
- Dale.

168
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:19,479
It's abstract expressionist.

169
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,133
What the hell does that mean?

170
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,689
Thank you all for ruing this.

171
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:26,189
You're the one who walked
to the opposite end of the office

172
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:28,190
to tell us you had a meeting.

173
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,691
If you're lucky,
you'll have a meeting.

174
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,895
And I'm not going to tell you
anything about the damn picture.

175
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:36,527
Why don't you just go look at it?

176
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,064
I'm sorry, Jane,

177
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:43,437
but you just don't walk
into his office like that.

178
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:46,005
- But he's gone for the day.
- That doesn't matter.

179
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,775
Miss Blankenship won't mind.

180
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:52,319
I'm going to go up and see it.

181
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,020
I'll go anywhere you go.

182
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:13,626
Well, she's gone.

183
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,196
What are you doing?

184
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:17,875
It's open.

185
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:19,845
Are you suicidal? Let's go.

186
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:22,334
I can't believe you all.

187
00:10:25,377 --> 00:10:26,827
Take off your shoes.

188
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:30,565
I feel like we're skinny dipping.

189
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:32,035
Call me from jail.

190
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:35,547
You're going to keep a lookout?

191
00:10:44,272 --> 00:10:45,878
Just don't touch anything.

192
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,148
It's a Rothko.

193
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,771
Why the hell didn't Dale say that?

194
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:52,808
$10,000.

195
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:57,786
So it's smudgy squares, huh?

196
00:10:58,536 --> 00:10:59,954
That's interesting.

197
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:02,566
Two possibilities...

198
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:06,189
either Cooper loves it
and you have to love it,

199
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:09,059
like in an "Emperor's New Clothes"
situation,

200
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:13,467
or he thinks it's a joke and you'll look
like a fool if you pretend to dig it.

201
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:16,872
People like him pretend
they understand this.

202
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:20,285
Maybe he has a brochure in here,
something that explains it.

203
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:22,253
I don't think it's
supposed to be explained.

204
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:23,823
I'm an artist, okay?

205
00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:25,961
It must mean something.

206
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:28,001
Maybe it doesn't.

207
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,939
Maybe you're just supposed
to experience it.

208
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,742
Because when you look at it,

209
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:33,571
you do feel something, right?

210
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,132
It's like looking
into something very deep.

211
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:42,411
You could fall in.

212
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,360
That's true.

213
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,394
Did someone tell you that?

214
00:11:48,514 --> 00:11:51,629
- How could someone tell you that?
- This is pointless. Let's go.

215
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:52,749
I'm ready.

216
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,939
Harry actually took the stairs.

217
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,538
We could have stolen it,
couldn't we?

218
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:13,985
Who are you?

219
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:17,440
I was thinking I could write
a great short story about this...

220
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,824
you know, the day
we looked at the painting.

221
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:21,442
I'm a writer.

222
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:25,109
I thought you were an accountant.

223
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,229
Accounts.

224
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,367
I've been published.

225
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,235
The Atlantic Monthly, Parabolas.

226
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:33,112
That's right. The story
about the maple tree.

227
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:35,257
It was beautiful and sad.

228
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:37,343
Really? You read it?

229
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,304
Everybody read it.
People were jealous.

230
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:44,240
Where are you headed?
Are you hungry?

231
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,610
No. Good night.

232
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:01,058
So you're still working here.

233
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,736
You missed something,
my yellow-bellied friend.

234
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:06,126
Jane Segal is a genuine thrill.

235
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:09,446
- Breaking and entering.
- I don't care about Jane.

236
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:12,113
Tell me about Coop's painting.

237
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,383
What about Mr. Cooper's painting?

238
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:22,606
Enjoy that.

239
00:13:22,828 --> 00:13:25,556
Can I get another coffee
here, please?

240
00:13:26,234 --> 00:13:28,084
I'll tell you what I heard.

241
00:13:28,204 --> 00:13:30,550
You, Mr. Cosgrove, and Jane
were in Mr. Cooper's office

242
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,236
looking at his painting.

243
00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:34,406
Anything you'd like to correct?

244
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:36,508
Mind your own business.

245
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:43,956
I had nothing to do with it.

246
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:46,077
Thank you.

247
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,455
Nothing happened.

248
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:58,715
If Kurt says we don't need artwork,
we don't need artwork.

249
00:13:58,876 --> 00:14:00,442
Is that what Kurt said?

250
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:02,067
Is that what you said?

251
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:03,678
Don has his signature.

252
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:06,135
It's nice down here.

253
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:08,816
Kenneth.

254
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:11,486
3:00, and he doesn't
talk in the meeting.

255
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:18,277
- How about last night, huh?
- Quite an adventure.

256
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,816
Listen, I was thinking about
what you said about my story,

257
00:14:23,936 --> 00:14:25,867
about it being sad and beautiful.

258
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:29,787
You're not like
everyone else around here.

259
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,725
I don't know if that's true.

260
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:37,588
Okay. Here goes.

261
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,224
Would you mind
taking a look at this?

262
00:14:43,168 --> 00:14:46,378
- Are you kidding?
- I don't want you to pull any punches,

263
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:49,432
unless you hate it,
in which case don't tell me.

264
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:51,136
I'm kind of fragile.

265
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,689
I'd be honored.

266
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:56,726
Well, great, then.

267
00:14:56,846 --> 00:14:58,107
Take your time.

268
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,836
You know, I can probably
read it by Sunday,

269
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,701
and you can come over for dinner,
you know, with Kitty and I.

270
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:11,955
I know you need a home-cooked meal.
You have plans?

271
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,143
No.

272
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:16,243
Are you sure it's okay?

273
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:18,451
You want me to give this back?

274
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,400
Young people do not drink coffee,

275
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:29,196
and that can become
a lifetime habit.

276
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:33,287
Now, we're aware that unsuccessful
attempts have been made...

277
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,630
puppets and so forth...

278
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,900
to capture the attention of youth.

279
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,988
That's why we're here.

280
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,321
There's an old saying...

281
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,790
when one is in Indian country,

282
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,275
one needs a man who knows Indians.

283
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:50,691
Mr. Smith?

284
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:54,619
So,

285
00:15:55,752 --> 00:15:57,126
where do we start?

286
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:59,695
Joe Martinson. Old cup of Joe.

287
00:15:59,815 --> 00:16:01,865
They named it after him, right?

288
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:04,927
That's just ancient history now.

289
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,435
There have been a million ways
that the folks on this avenue

290
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:09,881
have tried to tell
our generation what to do,

291
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:12,130
except we don't want
to be told what to do.

292
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,300
That's over.

293
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,789
We want to find things
for ourselves.

294
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,500
We want to feel.

295
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,256
Martinson's is a great coffee.

296
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:29,126
It's delicious, and
it's hot, and it's brown.

297
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,606
That's all you need to say.

298
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:34,014
We don't need more than that.

299
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:35,998
Peggy, sweetheart?

300
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:46,966
There's a place I like to go

301
00:16:47,693 --> 00:16:49,011
South of Mexico

302
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,669
With the coffee-colored girls

303
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:54,174
Wearing just a cup of Joe

304
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:56,022
Exotic girl

305
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:58,318
Exotic brew

306
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:01,482
Martinson, Martinson

307
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,696
Every day we rendezvous

308
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,758
I don't know if I understand this.

309
00:17:07,878 --> 00:17:09,447
It's a jingle, right?

310
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,784
It's a song, and it's a mood,

311
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:13,494
and it's a feeling.

312
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:15,828
It's definitely more than a jingle.

313
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,874
What do you think?

314
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:20,708
It stays with you.

315
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:25,088
What are the pictures
that go with this?

316
00:17:25,857 --> 00:17:27,846
If you sign, we'll tell you.

317
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,848
So Media Purchases.

318
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,526
Starting in March,
I'm looking at column 5,

319
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,153
under Regional Affiliates.

320
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:54,422
Mr. Crane, focus, please.

321
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:58,514
We didn't make you head of television
just to shorten your attention span.

322
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,108
I'm sorry, sir.

323
00:18:00,228 --> 00:18:02,626
I... I was admiring your painting.

324
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,016
The eye is drawn to it.

325
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,017
It's very modern.

326
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:12,427
Mark Rothko. I've read about him.

327
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:13,658
And?

328
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:16,974
What do you think about it?

329
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,009
Nobody has ever asked me that.

330
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:28,277
Probably because
it's none of their business.

331
00:18:29,606 --> 00:18:30,606
Right.

332
00:18:33,102 --> 00:18:34,741
How does it strike you?

333
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,164
Sir, I know nothing about art.

334
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:43,399
Mr. Crane, you're here
because of numbers.

335
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,652
Stick to that.

336
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,415
Don't concern yourself
with aesthetics.

337
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:49,642
You'll get a headache.

338
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,529
Of course.

339
00:18:56,903 --> 00:19:00,782
People buy things
to realize their aspirations.

340
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:03,394
It's the foundation of our business.

341
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,534
But between you and me
and the lamppost,

342
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:11,577
that thing should double
in value by next Christmas.

343
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,490
Where were we?

344
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,940
Column 5 here... Regional
Newspaper Affiliates.

345
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:28,861
Your hair is turning green.
You have to wear the bathing cap.

346
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,692
It squeezes my head.

347
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:39,290
Don't leave your wet suit
on the floor.

348
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,515
Draper residence.

349
00:19:40,935 --> 00:19:43,784
Is this the belle
of the Hudson River Valley?

350
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:44,954
Who is this?

351
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:47,952
It's Jimmy Barrett, sweetheart.

352
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:49,956
Mr. Barrett.

353
00:19:52,468 --> 00:19:55,239
Are you looking for Don?
Because he's at the office.

354
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:58,727
I know exactly what I'm doing.

355
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,972
ABC picked up Grin and Barrett,

356
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:03,413
my TV show, 39 episodes.

357
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:06,453
That's wonderful. Congratulations.

358
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:08,848
We're having a shindig
at the Stork Club.

359
00:20:08,968 --> 00:20:10,328
Donnie didn't get back to me,

360
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:11,910
so I figured if you're
anything like my wife,

361
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,430
you book the dance card.

362
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,472
<i>Monday night,
so the celebrities can come.</i>

363
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,036
That sounds like fun,

364
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:20,006
but celebrities make me shy.

365
00:20:20,781 --> 00:20:23,380
Keep playing that, gorgeous.
It works wonders.

366
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:26,842
I'll talk to Don about it.

367
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:28,893
Don't you want to go?

368
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:31,533
You can't leave me alone
with those people.

369
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:33,526
Ride the horse in,
like Lady Godiva.

370
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,730
I think I should hang up now.

371
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:42,193
It would mean a lot to me
if you were there.

372
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:46,030
We will try.
Have a nice day, Jimmy.

373
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:53,934
<i>Mr. Phillips.</i>

374
00:20:57,332 --> 00:21:00,224
Right now there's a little boy
running over here from Martinson Coffee

375
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,094
with a check in his hand.

376
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:04,510
It's done. Congratulations.

377
00:21:06,636 --> 00:21:07,529
Thanks.

378
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:09,849
You want me to send
for something for you?

379
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,548
No, but don't let me
dampen your spirits.

380
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:13,065
Unfurl the sails, please.

381
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,655
That was good advance work.

382
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:20,993
That's my job.

383
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:23,757
Maybe we'll get a shot
at LifeSavers.

384
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:28,205
Mr. Cooper wants to speak with you.

385
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:31,472
We'll be right there.

386
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:33,742
He just asked for you, Mr. Draper.

387
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:45,933
Thanks again.

388
00:21:58,102 --> 00:21:59,769
Congratulations, Don.

389
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:01,205
Sit with us.

390
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:04,158
Thank you.

391
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:06,847
I didn't do it alone.

392
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:08,019
Fascinating.

393
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:11,713
Jim Van Dyke of Martinson Coffee
was thoroughly impressed.

394
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,542
He's inviting you to join the board

395
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:15,711
of the Museum
of Early American Folk Arts.

396
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:17,022
That's nice.

397
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:18,844
What is it?

398
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,049
Doesn't exist yet.

399
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,557
But I've seen the opening exhibit.

400
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:24,222
Whirligigs.

401
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:27,100
Do they need a campaign?

402
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,394
No. Philanthropy
is the gateway to power.

403
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:32,619
If you say so.

404
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:35,536
We need you to continue
your excellence in advertising,

405
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:39,653
but also to start treating this like
part of a bigger business, which it is.

406
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:42,471
I will.

407
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:45,247
Do you understand what this means?

408
00:22:47,963 --> 00:22:51,331
You're going to be wearing
your Tuxedo a lot more.

409
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:55,909
It's time for the horse
to catch the carrot.

410
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,833
Roger, would you mind?

411
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:16,683
Would you agree that I know
a little bit about you?

412
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:19,970
A little.

413
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:23,975
There are few people
who get to decide

414
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:26,045
what will happen in our world.

415
00:23:27,784 --> 00:23:30,295
You have been invited to join them.

416
00:23:31,723 --> 00:23:33,273
Pull back the curtain

417
00:23:34,348 --> 00:23:35,798
and take your seat.

418
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:46,334
You're back.

419
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:48,098
I had a feeling.

420
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:50,765
You want to take it for a drive?

421
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:54,636
Wayne, I would like
to buy this car.

422
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:01,317
Jane, would you
come with me, please?

423
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,653
Is something wrong? Just tell me.

424
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,913
You want to have this conversation here?
Fine.

425
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:12,161
You broke into Mr. Cooper's office
with some executives after hours.

426
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:14,288
That's not true.

427
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:17,922
I'm not in the habit
of making empty accusations.

428
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:22,297
They made me. I had no choice.

429
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,051
Please. They'll do anything you say.
You work for Mr. Draper.

430
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,774
What's wrong with you?

431
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:32,598
- With me?
- Yes.

432
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,518
Are you the only one
who's allowed to have fun around here?

433
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:36,686
What?

434
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:39,281
Please. I don't need a mother.

435
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:41,449
I'm 20 years old.

436
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:43,901
Collect your things.

437
00:24:44,537 --> 00:24:45,537
What?

438
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:47,447
Get your things.

439
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,713
You can't be serious.

440
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,606
You want to have this conversation again
in front of Mr. Draper?

441
00:24:53,028 --> 00:24:55,854
I'm going to the break room
to find your replacement.

442
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:58,624
See that you are gone
by the time I return.

443
00:25:08,537 --> 00:25:09,537
Don!

444
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:12,709
You like it?

445
00:25:12,973 --> 00:25:14,723
I don't know what to say.

446
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,250
It's gorgeous.

447
00:25:20,538 --> 00:25:21,538
Slide over.

448
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,260
It's like the cockpit of a jet.

449
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:35,398
What's this for?

450
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:37,589
That is a headlight sensor.

451
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:40,792
It automatically dims the lights
as you approach another car.

452
00:25:42,346 --> 00:25:44,072
And these seats.

453
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:45,997
It was expensive.

454
00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:48,508
- Do you love it?
- I do.

455
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,511
Well, you deserve it.
You work so hard.

456
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:55,385
I can't wait to pull up
to the Stork Club in this.

457
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,256
Any time you want.

458
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:00,058
Monday night?

459
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:05,055
Jimmy Barrett's throwing
a party for his TV show.

460
00:26:05,175 --> 00:26:06,567
He called for you.

461
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:08,156
He called here?

462
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:10,833
He should have gone
through my secretary.

463
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,586
I think he likes talking to me.

464
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:20,852
The kids won't be home for an hour.

465
00:26:20,972 --> 00:26:23,122
Want to take her around the block?

466
00:26:29,469 --> 00:26:30,519
Not in here.

467
00:26:48,804 --> 00:26:50,119
Mr. Sterling?

468
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:53,198
I'm sorry. Ginger stepped away.

469
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:56,451
Well. Hello, there.

470
00:26:56,922 --> 00:26:59,621
I just wanted to say good-bye
and thank you

471
00:26:59,741 --> 00:27:01,352
for being so kind to me.

472
00:27:01,472 --> 00:27:02,472
Good-bye?

473
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:05,973
I've been fired.

474
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,089
Draper's a tough desk, honey.

475
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:12,085
Actually, it was Miss Holloway.

476
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,828
I can see someone wanting
to reprimand you seriously.

477
00:27:17,948 --> 00:27:20,517
But firing?
It's a little permanent.

478
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:25,563
Do you want a drink?
Not like you work here anymore.

479
00:27:29,776 --> 00:27:31,902
Would you like
to tell me what happened?

480
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:34,405
- You don't need to bother with this.
- I want to.

481
00:27:36,681 --> 00:27:38,702
I'm just trying to do my job.

482
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,734
Miss Holloway is...

483
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,851
well, she's going
through a rough time.

484
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:46,621
She's engaged, you know.

485
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:48,979
Tell you what.

486
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,249
You go home...

487
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,714
Where do you live?

488
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:54,473
In the Village.

489
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:55,509
Jane Street.

490
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:58,805
Jane on Jane Street.
That's a pretty picture.

491
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:04,102
Listen, you go home to your
little apartment on Jane Street.

492
00:28:04,222 --> 00:28:06,541
By the time you come
back here on Monday morning,

493
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,711
this will all be taken care of.

494
00:28:10,224 --> 00:28:11,374
Are you sure?

495
00:28:11,786 --> 00:28:12,936
No more tears.

496
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:16,727
I don't know what to say.

497
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:19,158
Thank you, Mr. Sterling.
Thank you so much.

498
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:40,028
That's my favorite tie.

499
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:42,198
He's late. I was expecting that.

500
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:43,683
He is a bachelor.

501
00:28:51,678 --> 00:28:54,521
Kitty, you could smell
heaven in the street.

502
00:28:54,641 --> 00:28:57,277
I'd like to take credit,
but it's all the maestro.

503
00:28:57,397 --> 00:28:58,847
These are beautiful.

504
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:00,903
Don't forget to put
an aspirin in the bottom.

505
00:29:01,023 --> 00:29:02,452
Keeps them fresh.

506
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:04,662
I know that. I told you that.

507
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:06,796
Can I offer you a drink?

508
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:08,457
Beer if you have it.

509
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,000
But wine with the spaghetti.

510
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:14,754
Your place is really wild.

511
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,708
Once we decided not
to look for a bigger place,

512
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:19,301
we just let ourselves go.

513
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:23,222
How did you two meet?

514
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:25,830
- It's a boring story.
- No, it's not.

515
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:29,061
I grew up
a block away from him in Baltimore.

516
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:32,398
I guess I just always had
a crush on an older man.

517
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,779
As soon as I moved my mother up here,
Kitty came along.

518
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,849
Come, come. Taste this sauce.

519
00:29:41,617 --> 00:29:43,967
Now tell me what you
think, and be honest.

520
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:45,137
I'm fragile.

521
00:29:49,023 --> 00:29:50,373
It's really good.

522
00:29:50,493 --> 00:29:52,474
It's better than a restaurant.

523
00:29:57,022 --> 00:29:59,194
I don't want this
hanging in the air.

524
00:29:59,314 --> 00:30:00,715
What are you talking about?

525
00:30:00,835 --> 00:30:03,162
My story. I don't want to sit
here the whole meal worrying

526
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:06,528
and then find out you didn't read it
or that you did and you didn't like it.

527
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:08,031
Are you kidding? I loved it.

528
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:09,581
- Loved what?
- His story.

529
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:12,019
Yes. He wouldn't
stop talking about it,

530
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:13,989
but he won't let me read it.

531
00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:15,647
I didn't know how you felt.

532
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,079
I wonder if one day
they'll rent this apartment

533
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:20,362
by bragging about the fact
that you ate here once.

534
00:30:21,638 --> 00:30:24,046
I'm going to be
eating here all the time.

535
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:27,704
To "The Gold Violin,"
by Kenneth Cosgrove.

536
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:37,145
You really liked it?

537
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:39,296
I did. It was lovely.

538
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:42,940
I saw one at the Met.

539
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:47,182
It's perfect in every way,
except it couldn't make music.

540
00:30:47,826 --> 00:30:48,826
Oh, my.

541
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:51,312
Shall we?

542
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,265
Is Bobby in the car again?

543
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:12,364
No. He's running around.

544
00:31:16,444 --> 00:31:18,064
So I don't understand.

545
00:31:18,184 --> 00:31:19,708
You'd rather play checkers

546
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:21,840
than the "look at the clouds" game.

547
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,884
I'd rather play with Silly Putty.

548
00:31:24,262 --> 00:31:26,136
I don't want it jammed
between my seats.

549
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:30,439
You know what, Sally?
Go play with Bobby.

550
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,388
We should do this more often.

551
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:37,978
We should only do this.

552
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,004
I have to go pee-pee.

553
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:46,751
Go behind a tree there.
No one's looking.

554
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:51,911
I want to tinkle outside.

555
00:31:53,118 --> 00:31:55,291
I don't know.
It's different for boys.

556
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:58,523
I think everybody should go
before we get in the car.

557
00:31:58,643 --> 00:32:00,784
- Do you have to go?
- No.

558
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:04,552
You kids are lucky.

559
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,416
When I was a little boy,

560
00:32:06,536 --> 00:32:07,803
back on the farm,

561
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:11,686
we had an outhouse
way out in the yard.

562
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:14,184
And on nights
when there was no moon,

563
00:32:14,304 --> 00:32:16,915
there was this rope
and you had to feel for it in the dark

564
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,606
and pull yourself across.

565
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:21,358
I'm glad we didn't live
in the olden days.

566
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:27,448
Are we rich?

567
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:32,932
It's not polite
to talk about money.

568
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,246
I did it!

569
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,022
I did it!

570
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,183
We should probably get going
if we don't want to hit traffic.

571
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:42,435
Sally, pack up the checkers.

572
00:32:57,165 --> 00:32:58,527
Check their hands.

573
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:47,070
You get the last of it.

574
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,373
- Should I get another?
- You can have mine.

575
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:53,158
So, Harry tell you
anything about his meeting?

576
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:55,896
- Harry's meeting with who?
- Mr. Cooper.

577
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:57,789
He says he knows the answer now.

578
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,539
Well, what was it?

579
00:34:00,086 --> 00:34:02,036
He says I wouldn't understand.

580
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:07,762
- Where do you live, Ken?
- Murray Hill.

581
00:34:07,882 --> 00:34:10,468
I can walk to the office,
but I don't.

582
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:13,680
I wonder if you're
going to get a call.

583
00:34:14,002 --> 00:34:16,355
I'm pretty sure he's going
through the whole roster.

584
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:19,221
Although, Cosgrove comes
before Crane, right?

585
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:22,741
My cousin has an advertising
agency in Montreal.

586
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:25,184
He's not interested in that.

587
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,943
How the heck did you
end up in accounts?

588
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,111
Me and a bunch of my college buddies
heard there was dough.

589
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:34,158
I was the only one who got a job.

590
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:37,036
- What about writing?
- That's just for fun.

591
00:34:38,794 --> 00:34:40,050
It's your hobby.

592
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,648
- I should go.
- You can't.

593
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,575
Don't you want coffee?

594
00:35:13,547 --> 00:35:16,367
Would it be rude to say that I have
a long ride back to Manhattan?

595
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,091
I can wrap up
a piece of pie for you.

596
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:21,161
It's pine nuts and pineapple.

597
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:23,662
If I eat any more, I'll burst.

598
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:26,439
You two have been wonderful.

599
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,715
Thanks for reading the story.

600
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:33,844
You can let her read it.

601
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:35,010
I can't wait.

602
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,513
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.

603
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:57,727
Do you want to have some pie?

604
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,786
No. I'm not hungry.

605
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,344
I'm just going to clean up.

606
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:04,539
Do you even care
that I want dessert?

607
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:07,543
Of course I do. I'll go get it.

608
00:36:08,052 --> 00:36:09,127
I'll get it.

609
00:36:09,882 --> 00:36:11,296
What's the matter, Kitty?

610
00:36:11,457 --> 00:36:14,751
I don't work where you do.
I've met these people once.

611
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:17,093
How am I supposed
to talk about them?

612
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:19,013
Come on, Kitty.

613
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,184
Do you even see me here?

614
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:24,976
Of course I do.

615
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,253
You wouldn't know it, Salvatore.

616
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:29,776
I'm sorry.

617
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,638
We were just talking about work.

618
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,620
You're right.

619
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:38,214
I was rude.

620
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:40,524
I tried to include myself.

621
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:45,576
A lot of people find me
very interesting, you know?

622
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:51,256
I am so sorry, Kitty.

623
00:37:00,028 --> 00:37:01,178
It's okay.

624
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:05,454
I'll get you some pie.

625
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:09,062
You put your feet up.
I'll take care of the kitchen.

626
00:37:45,483 --> 00:37:47,571
I have tickets
for the Mets tonight.

627
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:49,818
Great seats for probably
a terrible game.

628
00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:51,695
- I'll be by at 5.
- No, you won't,

629
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:54,568
and please don't lurk near my desk.
I'm being watched.

630
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:58,366
Have a good day.

631
00:38:03,386 --> 00:38:04,654
Good morning.

632
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:06,829
Morning.

633
00:38:07,563 --> 00:38:09,072
I was going to call Kitty today,

634
00:38:09,192 --> 00:38:10,971
but I don't know what it's like
with Italian people

635
00:38:11,091 --> 00:38:12,381
if you call someone's wife.

636
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:15,295
It's okay.
Give her a call. She'd like that.

637
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:19,071
Well, I just wanted to thank her...
both of you, really.

638
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,718
Every once in a while, you wish
you weren't a bachelor, you know?

639
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:25,571
And your home is kind of
what I have in mind,

640
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:27,183
the way you two are.

641
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:30,631
Well, we really enjoyed having you.

642
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:01,502
What on God's green earth
are you doing here?

643
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:03,551
I...

644
00:39:07,766 --> 00:39:09,516
Did Mr. Sterling speak with you?

645
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,696
No.

646
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:15,438
What could he possibly
have to do with this?

647
00:39:16,877 --> 00:39:20,026
I'll do whatever you want,
but he said that you do this a lot.

648
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:21,903
Do what?

649
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:24,354
Lose your temper.

650
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:26,825
That you're impetuous
and it's not serious.

651
00:39:32,443 --> 00:39:35,393
And what were you doing
talking to Mr. Sterling?

652
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:37,962
I ran into him on my way out.

653
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:40,067
Did you?

654
00:39:42,444 --> 00:39:43,894
Is there a problem?

655
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:46,246
No.

656
00:39:47,194 --> 00:39:48,944
There's no problem at all.

657
00:39:49,818 --> 00:39:51,068
It's very clear.

658
00:40:22,061 --> 00:40:24,043
Everyone looks so glamorous.

659
00:40:24,776 --> 00:40:27,007
Believe me, they're
saying that about you.

660
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:28,607
It's my earrings.

661
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:31,005
Do you rember? Bermuda?

662
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,766
I do.

663
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:34,556
There he is.

664
00:40:35,221 --> 00:40:36,257
Don Draper.

665
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,761
I heard you had something
to do with this.

666
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:41,775
Very little. Betty, this is
Andrew Colhold with ABC.

667
00:40:41,936 --> 00:40:44,320
- A pleasure to meet you.
- And you.

668
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,577
Isn't this a pleasant surprise?

669
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:49,147
Hello, Mrs. Draper.
You look stunning.

670
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,036
Hello, Mrs. Barrett.

671
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:56,457
Don, did Andrew tell you my idea
for working a few items into the show?

672
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,584
Not yet. Why don't
I get us some drinks?

673
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:02,546
- That's okay. Let me get them.
- I'll do it.

674
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:06,195
No, it sounds like you three
have business to discuss.

675
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:10,572
For example, a woman's
parking her car,

676
00:41:10,692 --> 00:41:13,325
and then Jimmy runs out and says
she's run over his Rolex watch,

677
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:15,441
so then we show the watch.

678
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,770
Of course Jimmy will need
a Rolex, I suppose.

679
00:41:19,189 --> 00:41:22,359
I don't care, as long
as we bury Candid Camera.

680
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,452
If you're trying to blend
into the wall, you can't.

681
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,131
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Hello, gorgeous.

682
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:40,751
What are you doing
standing here all alone?

683
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:42,794
They're talking business. I fled.

684
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,970
I'd better not.
I've had too much already.

685
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,659
I insist, huh?

686
00:41:55,093 --> 00:41:57,743
The drunker you are,
the funnier I become.

687
00:41:59,006 --> 00:42:00,438
ABC did research.

688
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,020
Come on. Let's keep
each other company.

689
00:42:12,148 --> 00:42:15,765
I wish I was a mosquito right now.
I would never leave you alone.

690
00:42:15,885 --> 00:42:17,693
Come to think of it,
I never do, do I?

691
00:42:17,813 --> 00:42:19,388
No, you don't.

692
00:42:19,508 --> 00:42:21,158
I'd want you on my arm.

693
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:27,372
Look at us, over here
at the kids'table.

694
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,701
What do you mean?

695
00:42:29,821 --> 00:42:31,271
Them. Your husband.

696
00:42:34,756 --> 00:42:37,715
I've been standing behind
guys like that my whole life.

697
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:40,309
I was lucky I was funny.
If I wasn't funny,

698
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:42,433
I would never have
gotten to meet you.

699
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:44,203
- That's not true.
- It is.

700
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:47,067
It's hard to believe there's
anything better than you.

701
00:42:47,227 --> 00:42:49,819
Hard to believe he could
do any better than you.

702
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:51,228
Please stop.

703
00:42:54,308 --> 00:42:56,915
What do you think happened
between the two of them?

704
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,304
Excuse me?

705
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:01,382
Come on. Look at them.

706
00:43:09,572 --> 00:43:11,853
I don't like what you're saying.

707
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,059
All I know is I know her,
and you know him,

708
00:43:14,179 --> 00:43:16,498
and there they are, and
they don't care where we are.

709
00:43:16,618 --> 00:43:17,418
Stop it.

710
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:18,848
- Hold on.
- Let me go.

711
00:43:19,009 --> 00:43:21,184
I don't like it
any more than you do.

712
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:24,056
You...

713
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:26,903
people are ugly and crude.

714
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:30,861
What people? You mean comedians?

715
00:44:14,714 --> 00:44:16,100
Leaving so soon?

716
00:44:16,408 --> 00:44:19,325
- We didn't get to talk.
- Betty's not feeling well.

717
00:44:19,495 --> 00:44:20,513
Too bad.

718
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:24,268
Here, let me get that.
It's the least I can do.

719
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:31,463
Thanks to you,
I got everything I wanted.

720
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:34,632
I don't know if that's possible,
Jimmy.

721
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:36,125
I got my relationship with Utz,

722
00:44:36,245 --> 00:44:37,949
my show, my money,

723
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,363
39 on the air.

724
00:44:39,621 --> 00:44:41,557
I'm going to be an institution.

725
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:43,725
I'll tell everyone I know.

726
00:44:43,887 --> 00:44:46,102
You know what I like
about you? Nothing.

727
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:47,895
But it's okay.

728
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:50,375
You got me everything I wanted.

729
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:51,845
What did you get?

730
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:52,994
Bobbie?

731
00:44:53,621 --> 00:44:55,571
Lots of people have had that.

732
00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:56,807
Excuse me?

733
00:44:56,983 --> 00:44:58,982
Please. I laugh at you.

734
00:44:59,683 --> 00:45:02,133
I go home at night,
and I laugh at you.

735
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:05,413
I don't know
what you think happened.

736
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:09,162
You, you want to step out,

737
00:45:09,444 --> 00:45:10,325
fine.

738
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,770
Go to a whore.

739
00:45:12,307 --> 00:45:14,557
You don't screw another man's wife.

740
00:45:14,677 --> 00:45:16,050
You're garbage.

741
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:18,996
And you know it.

742
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:22,556
Well.

743
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:24,821
Good night, you two.

744
00:45:24,941 --> 00:45:26,244
It's been a gas.
