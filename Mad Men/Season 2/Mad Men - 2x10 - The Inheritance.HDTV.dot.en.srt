Season 2 Episode 10
<i>The Inheritance</i>

3
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,390
General Motors, General Electric,

4
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,294
Ion Physics Corporation,
Bell Telephone Laboratories,

5
00:00:42,456 --> 00:00:45,882
Cosmic Inc., Electro-Optical Systems,
Incorporated,

00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:48,592
Texas Instruments, Inc.,

Hughes Aircraft, Martin Marietta,
Westinghouse, Aerojet,

8
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:56,308
Radio Corporation of America,
semi-conductors and materials division.

9
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,186
Sounds like a hell
of a stock portfolio.

10
00:00:58,346 --> 00:01:00,452
To everyone who's building a rocket.

11
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:02,517
Do you know, if we stay
in Beverly Hills,

12
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:04,264
even though the convention's
in Santa Monica,

13
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:05,609
we'll be halfway to Pasadena.

14
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,010
Pasadena?

15
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:08,821
Isn't it just people with T.B.?

16
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:12,080
Jet Propulsion Laboratories
and Ray Bradbury.

17
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:13,955
As much as I'd like to indulge

18
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:16,538
yourTwilight Zone fantasy
of being shot into space...

19
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:18,793
Believe me, it's our fantasy, too.

20
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:21,125
This is a business trip.

21
00:01:21,287 --> 00:01:22,793
I don't want either
of you coming back tan.

22
00:01:23,012 --> 00:01:25,962
- What if I have to play golf?
- As long as you lose.

23
00:01:26,082 --> 00:01:28,828
Crab Colson guarantees there
will be some astronauts there.

24
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:31,598
Really? My nephews
would love an autograph.

25
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:34,555
Astronauts love golf.
I'll see what I can do.

26
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:38,142
You're there to sell,
but you're also there to listen.

27
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,518
Every scientist, engineer,
in general, is trying

28
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:42,094
to figure out a way
to put a man on the moon

29
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:43,781
or blow up Moscow,

30
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:45,574
whichever one costs more.

31
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:48,902
We have to explain to them
how we can help them spend that money.

32
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:51,488
Well, it certainly would
behoove us to find out...

33
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,074
Campbell, you do the talking.
Kinsey, you do the listening.

34
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,412
Don, you wanted me to remind
them about the congressmen.

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,998
We know. They control
the purse strings.

36
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:04,169
No, they are the customer.

37
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:08,454
They want aerospace
in their districts.

38
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:10,765
Let them know that we can help them

39
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:12,969
bring these contracts home.

40
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,682
Did you read anything
that she prepared?

41
00:02:21,716 --> 00:02:23,598
Maybe I should send her.

42
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,701
You know I'll stay out of your way.

43
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:39,297
Of course.

44
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,435
Lounging at the pool.

45
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:44,124
They'll think you're
a young Barbara Stanwyck.

46
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:46,363
Doesn't that sound like fun?

47
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:50,425
If you're there, it will make me look
less serious in the office.

48
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:52,326
Next time.

49
00:02:53,074 --> 00:02:54,424
It's a week, Tweet

50
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,221
I suppose I can go to my
parents' place in Rehoboth.

51
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,835
Now you're making me feel bad.

52
00:02:59,955 --> 00:03:01,433
Is that the only alternative?

53
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:04,474
They keep asking to
spend time with me...

54
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:05,772
us.

55
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:09,175
They're concerned.

56
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:10,636
About what?

57
00:03:12,264 --> 00:03:13,714
Nothing's happening.

58
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:18,392
Why do you insist on making
me angry before I go to bed?

59
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,962
There are some
very reputable agencies.

60
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,999
- We can't even talk about this?
- Do I have to put my foot down?

61
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,750
What's wrong with it?

62
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:28,761
It's someone else's child.

63
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,448
Once you see

64
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:35,642
a beautiful little baby,
you'll fall in love.

65
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:38,305
- You know you will.
- It's not natural.

66
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:39,700
I felt that way,

67
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:42,204
but it changed.

68
00:03:44,018 --> 00:03:45,668
We would have our pick.

69
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:47,708
We are ideal candidates.

70
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,886
We have means,
and we've been to doctors,

71
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,720
so it's on the record
that it's something

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,903
we've been wanting for a long time.

73
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:02,745
Do your parents just think
I say no to everything?

74
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,264
We're not related by blood,
and you love me.

75
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:21,263
Hello.

76
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:22,764
It's me.

77
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,020
- What time is it?
- It's 10:00. Are you sleeping?

78
00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:29,825
No.

79
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:31,827
William called.

80
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:34,037
My father had a stroke.

81
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:38,572
Jesus.

82
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,264
Three days ago.

83
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:43,892
Gloria didn't even call me.
She had William call.

84
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:45,012
<i>Is it bad?</i>

85
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,287
She said he's up
and around, talking,

86
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,252
but she wouldn't
put him on the phone.

87
00:04:52,762 --> 00:04:55,207
- I'm coming to get you.
- No.

88
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,800
Bets, it's not up for discussion.
Take the kids to Francine.

89
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,389
I don't want to wake them.

90
00:05:01,016 --> 00:05:02,016
Fine.

91
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,973
I'll be by in the morning.

92
00:05:04,326 --> 00:05:05,326
God.

93
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:09,051
You know, I've been
dreaming about a suitcase?

94
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,605
Everything's going to be okay.

95
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:14,201
Sure.

96
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:16,360
Everything's perfect.

97
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:19,453
I'll be by at 8.

98
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:22,391
Good-bye.

99
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,477
- Hello, Betty.
- Hello, Gloria.

100
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,015
Hello, Don.

101
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,271
Look at the two of you.

102
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,413
I swear to you,
the doctors say it is not serious.

103
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:45,565
We can get a room down
the road at the William Penn.

104
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:46,685
Nonsense.

105
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:50,003
Where is he? Can I see him?

106
00:05:50,123 --> 00:05:51,563
He's getting dressed.

107
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:54,233
They said he should
do things on his own.

108
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,433
Come, sit.

109
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,363
Don't do that.

110
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:05,034
We're supposed to keep it dim.
I don't know why.

111
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:08,774
Let me check on him.

112
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:11,941
William. I wasn't expecting you.

113
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:14,011
- Good morning.
- Look who's here.

114
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:19,814
He doesn't seem that bad.

115
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,484
Don, good to see you.

116
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:23,566
Sorry about your dad.

117
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:25,136
We'll get by, right?

118
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,932
Judy's coming later. She's dropping
the girls off at her mother's.

119
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:30,144
Gloria, everything is copasetic.

120
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:32,937
It'll be nice to see her.

121
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:41,452
It's an angel.

122
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,253
Hi, Daddy.

123
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:45,123
That's what I needed.

124
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:47,284
Hello, Don.

125
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:51,502
- Get that look off your face.
- Good to see you, Gene.

126
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:54,511
I'll take a visit from you two
anyway I can get it.

127
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:57,901
Where are the munchkins?

128
00:06:58,021 --> 00:06:59,498
With a neighbor.

129
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,467
Hey, Pop, did you see don's car?

130
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:05,564
You finally step up to a Lincoln?

131
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:08,291
Coupe De Ville.
Ice-blue. White top.

132
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,059
Very nice.

133
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,316
How you feeling, Daddy?

134
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:15,386
That's a tempest in a teapot.

135
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,564
You should of seen her
in the ambulance.

136
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:20,126
We were halfway to the hospital

137
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:22,596
before I noticed
I was in my nightie.

138
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:25,739
A woman my age
should not travel that way.

139
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,754
Wish you'd called earlier.

140
00:07:27,874 --> 00:07:30,577
The other partners at Don's firm
know all kinds of doctors.

141
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:33,706
In New York. Right.
Where everything's better.

142
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:39,288
Always with her brow
in a knit, my Ruthie here.

143
00:07:40,263 --> 00:07:42,548
Ruthie, my love, have you
offered everybody coffee?

144
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:45,747
I'm Betty.

145
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:48,412
Of course you are.

146
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:50,389
Gene, this is Betty, your daughter.

147
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,143
It's not Ruth. Ruth is dead.

148
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,521
Nobody wants coffee, Daddy.

149
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:05,186
Don, you were able to get off work?

150
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:06,812
I'm here.

151
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,723
- You want a drink?
- I'll get some ice.

152
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:15,812
What did the doctors say?

153
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:17,374
It's just like last time.

154
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:18,937
What?

155
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,337
Last time? This happened before?

156
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:25,048
Don't get mad at her.
It's a couple little strokes.

157
00:08:25,654 --> 00:08:26,884
Runs in the family.

158
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:28,566
You know Gene.

159
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:30,930
Always has to be the one
taking care of things.

160
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:39,063
So, Don, how did you come?
Did you take the Turnpike?

161
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,187
Yes.

162
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,331
Look at this. It's my lunch date.

163
00:08:58,436 --> 00:09:00,186
Hello, baby. You're early.

164
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:03,265
You remember Ken and Pete?

165
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:04,772
Hello, Sheila.

166
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:08,175
Want to get in a few more meals
before you lose him to the Golden West?

167
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,819
- What are you talking about?
- We're going to Los Angeles together.

168
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,806
It's horrible,
but somebody has to go.

169
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:16,126
Where?

170
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:19,002
- Californ-I-A.
- Thank you, Pete.

171
00:09:20,138 --> 00:09:21,253
Come on, Campbell.

172
00:09:21,373 --> 00:09:23,566
Time to put something
else in that mouth.

173
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:24,936
Nice to see you.

174
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,007
I was going to tell you at lunch.

175
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:31,277
Why are you going to Los Angeles?

176
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:33,701
Come on. Not here.

177
00:09:39,118 --> 00:09:40,368
It just came up.

178
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,878
The election's not for months.
We can register voters in October.

179
00:09:44,038 --> 00:09:46,548
It has nothing to do with the election.
You know that.

180
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:48,444
If you don't mind,

181
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:51,693
I'd rather face Mississippi
and those people screaming at me

182
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:54,848
and maybe getting shot
after I go to California.

183
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:56,314
Are you scared?

184
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:58,976
Don't pretend like it's not scary.

185
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,624
- Look, I have to go.
- Why? What is so important?

186
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:05,913
It's a convention.

187
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:09,213
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

188
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,006
Hello, Mr. Kinsey.

189
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,929
Please, Hollis. It's Paul.

190
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,750
This is Sheila, my girlfriend.

191
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,727
Nice to meet you.

192
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,813
Did you ever really plan
on going down South?

193
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:36,152
How could you ask that?

194
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,101
This just came up.

195
00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:44,555
You can always get another
job at a grocery store.

196
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:47,025
I can't just walk
into an ad agency.

197
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:50,374
I can't believe you.

198
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:53,713
All you do is complain about that place
and those people.

199
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,361
That's not true.

200
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:56,737
Well, I'm going.

201
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,756
I guess I'll just hop
in Billy Kaplan's bus

202
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:00,191
with ten strangers.

203
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:01,961
Why can't it wait?

204
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:07,536
19th Street.

205
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:11,882
This was all supposed to be ours.

206
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,837
I keep thinking what would have happened
if Dad had lived.

207
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:16,845
He'd be on his knees to us.

208
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:20,306
What about all that money
Dad gave to Lincoln Center?

209
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:21,576
Get that back.

210
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:24,144
You can't take a donation back.

211
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:27,370
Listen, I'm as upset as you are.

212
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,608
We're about to finally
buy in Millbrook.

213
00:11:30,362 --> 00:11:32,412
How long can she afford to live?

214
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:35,531
By golly, Pete, maybe we can
get rid of her tonight.

215
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:37,053
RemberRope?

216
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:44,618
Well, look, all we have to do
is go over there, get her signature,

217
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,459
mourn over the loss of our birthright,
and move on.

218
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,430
I hate going there.

219
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,550
The smell.

220
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:53,257
To the end of the line.

221
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:00,938
Does Judy want kids?

222
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:04,358
We have a five-year plan,
although secretly I think Judy hopes

223
00:12:04,478 --> 00:12:06,895
we're that childless couple
people invite over.

224
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:09,930
Trudy?

225
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:12,662
We've tried.

226
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,738
That must be disappointing.

227
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,014
Adoption.

228
00:12:23,113 --> 00:12:24,363
People do that.

229
00:12:25,987 --> 00:12:26,987
They do.

230
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:34,590
So the Yankees are having
a hell of a year.

231
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,528
Do you take Bobby?

232
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:38,184
All the time.

233
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:41,121
We really thought you were going
to make it to Cape May.

234
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:44,129
Although, without Betty there,
everyone had a turn at winning.

235
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:46,435
Elizabeth's got a mind for cards.

236
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:00,950
Where were you?

237
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:04,402
I was hiding in the tree house.

238
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:06,416
It's like a tomb in there.

239
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,248
I don't know how Don's standing it.

240
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:11,378
Is this the last picture
of her in the house?

241
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:12,697
I don't know.

242
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:17,353
- Where's the ottoman with the birds?
- I don't know, Betty.

243
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:20,162
I mean, can you blame her?

244
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:22,012
I wouldn't want
to live with Mom's ghost.

245
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:26,558
She's a silly woman.
All that talk about her underthings.

246
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,854
Daddy used to fine us
for small talk, remember?

247
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,296
Conversation is an art.

248
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:35,585
Well, it is.

249
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:42,574
How long has he been like this?

250
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:46,479
He was acting queer
on the golf course last month.

251
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:48,914
Let one of the colored
caddies really have it.

252
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,376
Look, Gloria's helping us.

253
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:54,091
I don't want to get stuck with him

254
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:56,255
just because I cared
enough not to move away.

255
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,560
Don works in Manhattan.

256
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,959
You know I wish I could be here.

257
00:14:01,614 --> 00:14:03,012
You only have two kids.

258
00:14:03,173 --> 00:14:05,187
Lord knows Don could afford
to build him a house

259
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:07,104
in his backyard if he wanted to.

260
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:08,892
Stop counting other people's money.

261
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:13,689
And the jardinire.

262
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:15,566
The what?

263
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:17,276
It used to be right there.

264
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:19,320
The ceramic thing?

265
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:24,325
I think we have that.

266
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:27,790
Do I have to go around and write my name
on all t things that I want?

267
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,645
Bets, you're drunk.

268
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,099
Well, I hope everybody's hungry.

269
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:34,797
We're minutes away.

270
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:36,936
Why is that window open?

271
00:14:45,142 --> 00:14:47,139
Look at that. You found a corner.

272
00:14:47,785 --> 00:14:49,435
You're pulling your end.

273
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,800
Can't say the same about him.

274
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,355
Don's helping.

275
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:56,175
Who know what he does,
why he does it?

276
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,526
I know more about the kid
who fixes my damn car.

277
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:02,113
Dad, you're hurting Don's feelings.

278
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:04,574
It's okay.

279
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:07,725
Nobody has what you have.

280
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:10,164
You act like it's nothing.

281
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:13,189
My daughter's a princess.
You know that?

282
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:14,524
Dinner time.

283
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,036
What's going on?

284
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:21,840
He has no people!

285
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,598
- You can't trust a person like that!
- Daddy.

286
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:34,052
Fine. Let's go eat.

287
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:46,849
Come on.

288
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:49,176
I have no appetite.

289
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:51,525
Birdy, you should eat.

290
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:52,812
Stop it, Don.

291
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,452
Nobody's watching.

292
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,323
And here, Mother.

293
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:10,598
How many of these are there?

294
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:12,851
Hello, all.

295
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,603
I brought my pen.
Hope I didn't miss anything.

296
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,669
Other than dinner, no.

297
00:16:18,349 --> 00:16:19,499
Hello, Mother.

298
00:16:22,943 --> 00:16:24,069
I think it's nice

299
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,656
that even though you've
let Bud do all the work,

300
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:29,116
you found time to grace us
with your signature.

301
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,474
Yes, well, anything I can do.

302
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,539
I just hope you don't
get too used to this.

303
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,161
To what?

304
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:38,587
This family.

305
00:16:39,704 --> 00:16:41,605
It has come to my attention
that you and Trudy

306
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:43,979
are considering a child
that's not your own.

307
00:16:44,099 --> 00:16:45,249
Is this true?

308
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:49,053
It just came up.

309
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:50,917
How is that possible?

310
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,545
I would hate to have to exclude you

311
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:56,615
from what is rightfully yours.

312
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,270
You have to keep at it.

313
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,591
You know what, Mother?

314
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,152
This is not a topic
of conversation.

315
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:07,364
I think you know how your father felt
about the whole idea.

316
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:10,313
It's suitable for some.

317
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:13,410
But really,
you're pulling from the discards.

318
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,854
- My father?
- Yes.

319
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:22,920
Your husband spent
everything you had.

320
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,815
Spent it with strangers.

321
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:28,789
All of it.

322
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:31,418
What are you talking about?

323
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,847
I'll messenger these
to your office tomorrow.

324
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:35,489
That's a swell idea.

325
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:38,769
The tone of your voice...
I don't like it.

326
00:17:39,914 --> 00:17:41,064
Oh, that, too?

327
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,380
Stop being dramatic.

328
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,668
Bud, what is my fiduciary estate?

329
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:49,478
Tell her.

330
00:17:55,415 --> 00:17:58,539
We had to liquidate your holdings
to ensure your future comfort.

331
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:01,500
Why? Who asked you to do that?

332
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:04,128
The market took a turn
for the worse.

333
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:08,507
Real estate? I think I would have
heard about that.

334
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,039
Yes, well,

335
00:18:11,728 --> 00:18:14,278
don't forget to send
those by my office.

336
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,732
Do you want me to
lay everything out for you?

337
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:35,602
It's been a day.
I just want to go to sleep.

338
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:07,719
You're smoking like a chimney.

339
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,855
It gives you wrinkles, you know.

340
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,355
Good morning, everyone.

341
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:17,071
- Gene.
- Morning, Don.

342
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,671
I have some batter left.
Would you like some waffles?

343
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:23,601
No. This will be fine.

344
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:25,160
And coffee.

345
00:21:26,091 --> 00:21:28,122
Morning, everybody.
Do you want breakfast?

346
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:29,083
No.

347
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:30,513
I had no idea.

348
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:36,025
- Please, Judy, it's okay.
- No, it's yours. I feel terrible.

349
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:38,770
I didn't know
your mother promised it to you.

350
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:42,084
Really, Judy, it's okay. I wish
he hadn't brought it up with you.

351
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:43,597
I'm putting it over here.

352
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:48,147
Isn't Viola coming today?

353
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:49,104
Later.

354
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:51,650
There's no chance she'll miss you.

355
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,768
- Leave the dishes.
- Nonsense.

356
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,504
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

357
00:21:57,624 --> 00:22:00,155
Now that you've fed me,
why don't we go upstairs?

358
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:03,582
I'm fine.

359
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,713
I don't know what to say.
He's so mixed up.

360
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,209
- Gene, you are mixed up!
- You're mixed up.

361
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:14,211
He's tired.
He didn't sleep last night.

362
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:15,767
Of course.

363
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,647
Dad, you have to go
back to the doctor.

364
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,847
I already have
an appointment for Monday.

365
00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:31,645
So...

366
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,642
Daddy, what would you
like to do today?

367
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:36,594
Finish that puzzle?

368
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,083
Sure.

369
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:40,923
And maybe drive into town.

370
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:42,906
Get you a milkshake.

371
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,969
That's a grand idea.

372
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:02,956
Come in.

373
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:06,833
Finally.

374
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,669
I told her to call you.

375
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:12,394
- You should have called me.
- Hello, Viola.

376
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,137
And you two look good, considering.

377
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:20,360
- How are the children?
- They're good.

378
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:24,145
I'm gonna make some calls.

379
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:29,161
You should be here every day.

380
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:30,996
That's not up to me.

381
00:23:31,157 --> 00:23:33,920
Why not? You've been
here longer than her.

382
00:23:34,834 --> 00:23:37,836
- He needs you.
- I don't know about that.

383
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:41,185
And you let Gloria
and Judy ransack the house.

384
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:43,882
You want to give me your temper?

385
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:55,646
He doesn't know who I am.

386
00:23:56,397 --> 00:23:57,947
He's very, very sick.

387
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:06,084
You don't know how nice it is
to hear someone say that.

388
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,571
Is he dying?

389
00:24:18,721 --> 00:24:20,840
I was at Elkins Park
Hospital on Sunday

390
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,610
when they talked to her.

391
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,718
It's just going to get worse.

392
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:30,934
I don't know how much more
I can take.

393
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:34,523
Well, this day comes eventually,
like it or not.

394
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,170
I'm an orphan.

395
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:44,672
You are supposed
to take care of your husband

396
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:46,825
and your beautiful children now.

397
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:48,956
They are yours.

398
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,329
You'll see.

399
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,184
The minute you leave, you'll rember him
exactly the way he used to be.

400
00:25:00,781 --> 00:25:02,945
It's all good outside that door.

401
00:25:12,841 --> 00:25:14,058
Want these upstairs?

402
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:17,144
No. I have to put it
all in the wash.

403
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:19,772
I'll go get the kids.

404
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:22,083
Francine promised them
the pool tomorrow.

405
00:25:22,203 --> 00:25:24,276
Carla will bring them home later.

406
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:28,572
I'm gonna take a shower.

407
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:32,209
What?

408
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:35,019
I think you should leave.

409
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:37,958
Really?

410
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,519
Yes.

411
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:45,302
- You're upset.
- I am.

412
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:48,781
And I know how you feel
about grieving.

413
00:25:50,893 --> 00:25:53,013
I think I should be here for you.

414
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,470
That's your reason.

415
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:59,144
What do you want me to say?

416
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:02,745
I want to be here.

417
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:05,182
You need me here.

418
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,580
Why?

419
00:26:08,581 --> 00:26:09,931
Nothing's changed.

420
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,420
We were just pretending.

421
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:37,961
Good afternoon, Mr. Draper.

422
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:39,231
Hello, Donna.

423
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:40,811
Allison.

424
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:42,396
Of course.

425
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:08,932
Surprise!

426
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:24,064
And this beautiful layette.

427
00:27:24,224 --> 00:27:26,449
We've also attempted
to fortify your castle.

428
00:27:26,815 --> 00:27:28,943
Lucky Strike, Martinson Coffee,

429
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,987
Pampers, and some Clearasil,
for when it gets bigger.

430
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:35,052
You raided the storeroom for me.

431
00:27:35,815 --> 00:27:38,442
Well, Daddy-o, we've given
this a lot of thought.

432
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:41,632
You are going to be blessed
with a stinking miracle.

433
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:42,820
Stop it!

434
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,334
So, in assessing the damage
to your private life,

435
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,822
we've gotten you
some reading material.

436
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:51,336
What do you get for the man
who's about to have nothing?

437
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:53,174
- No, no, no, no.
- Speech, speech.

438
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,723
- I'm very touched by this party.
- That's the whole point.

439
00:27:59,885 --> 00:28:01,591
You're not going to be touched.

440
00:28:02,513 --> 00:28:04,463
I got it, Paul. Knock it off.

441
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,356
I want to toast all of you.

442
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:11,321
And let's hope when this baby comes
that he likes Luckys.

443
00:28:11,604 --> 00:28:14,268
Here's to the little one,
whatever it may be.

444
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:16,431
- Cheers.
- Salut.

445
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:21,871
I just wanted to say
Happy Birthday.

446
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:30,946
What's this?

447
00:28:31,693 --> 00:28:32,693
Tiffany's?

448
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:35,698
Who's it from?

449
00:28:35,818 --> 00:28:36,818
From Jane.

450
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:38,705
And Roger, I'm sure.

451
00:28:42,836 --> 00:28:44,410
Will you cut the cake, dear?

452
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,945
Mr. Draper.

453
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,364
I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.
How is everything?

454
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:53,191
About how those things are.

455
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:56,322
Joan, if you don't mind,
can I borrow you for a moment?

456
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:57,991
- Of course.
- Thank you.

457
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Thank you.

458
00:29:09,954 --> 00:29:12,555
And you have your meeting
with Mr. Odino at 10 tomorrow.

459
00:29:12,675 --> 00:29:15,825
And then Lee Garner, Jr.
And the TV Department at 3.

460
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,384
Cancel everything.

461
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:18,989
Yes, of course.

462
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:20,596
Reschedule for Friday?

463
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:22,993
No. Clear the week.

464
00:29:24,171 --> 00:29:25,060
So,

465
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:28,146
how was your family emergency?

466
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,357
Memorable. Thank you.

467
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,608
I assume that means
everything's okay?

468
00:29:34,354 --> 00:29:37,112
I'm leaving for California tomorrow
for the Rocket Fair.

469
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,825
Good for you.

470
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:40,818
Sunshine, bikinis.

471
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:45,179
But, uh, didn't we already
send a couple men?

472
00:29:45,556 --> 00:29:47,006
Campbell and Kinsey?

473
00:29:47,677 --> 00:29:48,677
Not yet.

474
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,940
Well, Campbell has got to go.

475
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,048
I've held his hand
through 30 phone calls.

476
00:29:57,877 --> 00:29:59,870
Very good, then.
Bring me a bag of oranges.

477
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm sure Joan here
can hold down the fort.

478
00:30:03,175 --> 00:30:05,015
She's been doing it so far.

479
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:08,227
Told you you'd be in good
hands with Miss Holloway.

480
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:17,530
I'll need you to send
a memo to Mr. Kinsey

481
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,799
explaining this change in plans.

482
00:30:20,553 --> 00:30:22,103
I'll take care of it.

483
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,703
You look like you didn't
get any sleep last night.

484
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,180
I did.

485
00:30:29,554 --> 00:30:32,241
Go ahead. Lay down.
I'll keep the drunks away.

486
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,370
I heard it's very hard
to get anything done there

487
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,807
because of the weather, you know?
People don't work.

488
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,123
Sounds good to me.

489
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,649
I'm sure I'll be going
sometime in the next few months.

490
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,256
All the networks keep saying

491
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:51,604
how I need to come out
and shave my face.

492
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,417
I mean show.

493
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:55,176
What's in this?

494
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:58,402
You're just gonna fly off
and leave your wife and newborn?

495
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:07,644
I just want to say
that I am so happy for you

496
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:10,496
and that you're
gonna be the best father

497
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:12,876
and that I'm really happy for you.

498
00:31:13,927 --> 00:31:14,835
Thank you.

499
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:27,621
- Mr. Kinsey?
- Yes, Joan.

500
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:30,795
Mr. Draper wanted you to be informed
that he will be going to Los Angeles

501
00:31:30,915 --> 00:31:32,192
for the convention.

502
00:31:32,312 --> 00:31:34,563
Great. We won't
have to fly tourist.

503
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:37,358
No. It's just he
and Mr. Campbell going.

504
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,486
- What?
- Don's going with Pete?

505
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:42,593
He can't do that.

506
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:45,997
I'm sure it must be disappointing.

507
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:48,246
I'll need your tickets
and your badges.

508
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:50,454
That's not right.
Why can't we all go?

509
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:54,128
I really need everything right away.
Or are they at home?

510
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:03,425
Is there any cake left?

511
00:32:04,307 --> 00:32:05,857
Hey, Sheila. It's me.

512
00:32:08,084 --> 00:32:11,872
No, I know that. And I want you to know
I've thought about it...

513
00:32:11,992 --> 00:32:13,142
Let me finish.

514
00:32:14,346 --> 00:32:16,480
I'm going to stand there
arm-in-arm with you

515
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,939
and make a stand.

516
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:22,676
It's not just about you and me.

517
00:32:24,556 --> 00:32:25,606
I know that.

518
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:30,792
No one's been shot lately, okay?

519
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,730
I love you, too, baby.

520
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:52,914
May I speak with you?

521
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,179
- Heck of a party, huh?
- Yes.

522
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,242
- I'm going away, you know.
- Of course.

523
00:33:04,931 --> 00:33:05,931
On a plane.

524
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:10,117
What do you want me to say?
That I wish I was going?

525
00:33:11,117 --> 00:33:12,183
Everybody does.

526
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:14,330
I've never even been on a plane.

527
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:15,645
Well, I have.

528
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:18,756
But not since my father died.

529
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:23,744
I'm sorry.

530
00:33:24,622 --> 00:33:25,872
I'm not scared.

531
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:28,302
It just seems significant, is all.

532
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:31,247
Statistically speaking,
it's very unlikely

533
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,705
that it will happen to two people
in one family.

534
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,169
That's true.

535
00:33:39,314 --> 00:33:41,231
Besides, it wouldn't
be the worst thing.

536
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:44,662
- Excuse me?
- I hate my mother.

537
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:47,446
What do you think of that?

538
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,574
Come on, you must have an opinion.

539
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:53,285
I don't know the circumstances.

540
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:55,749
I don't know what
I should expect from her.

541
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,666
- I don't know her.
- Like Bud and I turned out so great.

542
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:03,182
Who's to say it wouldn't be better?

543
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,464
So it's not yours.
That could be good.

544
00:34:05,932 --> 00:34:08,382
I don't know what
you're talking about.

545
00:34:09,286 --> 00:34:11,636
But I think your flight
will be fine.

546
00:34:13,162 --> 00:34:14,612
You should go home.

547
00:34:17,328 --> 00:34:19,360
Everything's so easy for you.

548
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,025
It's not easy for anyone, Pete.

549
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:30,138
Have a great trip.

550
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:21,938
What's there?

551
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:33,202
Glen, what are you doing?

552
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:36,165
Nothing.

553
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:40,851
How long have you been out here?

554
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:42,816
I don't know.

555
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
A few days.

556
00:35:48,289 --> 00:35:49,439
What happened?

557
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,296
I didn't know if I was
going to see you again.

558
00:35:57,012 --> 00:35:59,036
And then you weren't even home.

559
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:02,638
Did you run away?

560
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:05,851
So?

561
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:19,974
I think you should
tell me what happened.

562
00:36:20,353 --> 00:36:23,203
My dad wants Charlotte
and me to live with him.

563
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:24,917
My mom doesn't care.

564
00:36:25,037 --> 00:36:26,647
I'm sure that's not true.

565
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,090
She just wants to be
with her boyfriends.

566
00:36:30,915 --> 00:36:33,065
Does she have a lot of boyfriends?

567
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:35,543
I guess.

568
00:36:35,663 --> 00:36:37,113
They give me things.

569
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:41,868
I haven't seen you in so long,

570
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:43,747
except driving down the street.

571
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,812
I know. I know.

572
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,798
Can I use the bathroom?

573
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:55,134
Do you want me
to wash your clothes?

574
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,669
Is that shirt okay?

575
00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:22,339
That almost fits you.

576
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,480
Go ahead.

577
00:37:41,103 --> 00:37:42,753
Why are you alone here?

578
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:46,017
It's the middle of the day.

579
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:47,665
It's lousy.

580
00:37:51,542 --> 00:37:54,109
You understand why your
mother was mad at me, I hope.

581
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:58,656
Because she doesn't understand.

582
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:01,973
That's true.

583
00:38:06,796 --> 00:38:08,246
I'm not going home.

584
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:12,054
Because I know
I'm a problem for them.

585
00:38:13,164 --> 00:38:15,839
I know I am because
they keep saying I'm not.

586
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:18,008
Did you do something?

587
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,358
No. But my mom is never home.

588
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:24,637
My dad has another baby.

589
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,699
His wife is pretty mean.

590
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:29,936
Where's your mother?

591
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:32,449
I don't know.

592
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:34,525
Writing pamphlets
and handing them out.

593
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:38,448
I'm pretty responsible.

594
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,448
I brush my sister's teeth
and put us both to bed.

595
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:43,489
That's very sweet of you.

596
00:38:49,438 --> 00:38:51,261
Aren't you going to eat?

597
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,343
Can I tell you something?

598
00:39:18,058 --> 00:39:19,058
Of course.

599
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:21,594
I don't like ham.

600
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:24,122
I don't like meat at all, actually.

601
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:31,093
I'm sorry. Do you want me to make you
some macaroni and cheese?

602
00:39:58,181 --> 00:39:59,731
I came to rescue you.

603
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:04,468
Did you bring your cape?

604
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:06,121
I'm not joking.

605
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:08,832
We can go anywhere. I have money.

606
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,441
Mommy! I missed you!

607
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:28,285
I missed you, too.

608
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:30,308
How is he?

609
00:40:30,748 --> 00:40:32,233
Who? Your father.

610
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:34,595
He's not good.

611
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,689
Carla, this is Glen Bishop.

612
00:40:38,365 --> 00:40:40,641
Sally, Bobby, you remember
Glen from down the street.

613
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:41,770
Hi, Glen. Hi.

614
00:40:43,558 --> 00:40:46,758
Why don't you take Glen upstairs
and show him the trains Daddy got you?

615
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:49,123
You can use the controls.

616
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:52,946
Go ahead. It's okay.

617
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:02,631
What's he doing here?

618
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,745
Glen, can you come in here?

619
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,036
Glen, get over here now.

620
00:41:41,737 --> 00:41:43,340
I was worried sick.

621
00:41:44,073 --> 00:41:45,716
Glen, you have to go home.

622
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,501
You can't do things like this.

623
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,692
Let's go. Your father's on his way.

624
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:06,237
I hate you.

625
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:09,573
- Apologize right this minute.
- No, it's true.

626
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:11,051
I hate you.

627
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:14,432
I know.

628
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:19,735
I'm sorry.

629
00:42:38,986 --> 00:42:41,136
Come on. Let's wash up for dinner.

630
00:42:44,325 --> 00:42:47,319
Advertising, if anything,
helps bring on change.

631
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:50,557
The market... and I'm talking
in a purely Marxist sense...

632
00:42:50,677 --> 00:42:53,127
dictates that we must
include everyone.

633
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,552
The consumer has no color.

634
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,620
Betty, I'm sorry.
But we really need to talk.

635
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:20,019
There's nothing to talk about.

636
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,623
I don't know why he was over here,

637
00:43:23,173 --> 00:43:24,747
but this has to stop.

638
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:31,484
Nothing's going on.

639
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:35,671
Except that Glen feels alone.

640
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:38,382
Honestly, I don't blame him.

641
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,624
What did he say?

642
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:42,970
Nothing.

643
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:45,259
But it's obvious.

644
00:43:46,898 --> 00:43:48,923
He depends on you for everything.

645
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:52,468
You're supposed to be
taking care of him.

646
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,011
You're his mother.

647
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:55,921
And he gets nothing.

648
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,700
I thought with Dan out of our lives,
it would be different.

649
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:06,140
Glen's right.

650
00:44:07,223 --> 00:44:09,473
I'm not a very good mother anymore.

651
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:22,649
Don isn't living here.

652
00:44:28,178 --> 00:44:29,660
I'm sorry.

653
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:34,921
We haven't told the children.

654
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:37,416
Is it... over?

655
00:44:40,099 --> 00:44:41,649
I... I don't even know.

656
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,822
That's the worst.

657
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:47,649
Do they see him?

658
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:50,683
He takes them to dinner.

659
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,824
They don't know what made them
so special all of the sudden.

660
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:58,311
I don't know.

661
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:02,113
For me, it wasn't that different
without him there.

662
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:09,946
Sometimes I feel
like I'll float away

663
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:12,672
if Don isn't holding me down.

664
00:45:19,036 --> 00:45:20,286
The hardest part

665
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:23,237
is realizing you're in charge.

666
00:45:35,962 --> 00:45:36,977
<i>As you can see,</i>

667
00:45:37,097 --> 00:45:39,743
<i>the pilot has turned off
the "No Smoking" sign.</i>

668
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:43,641
<i>We're expecting clear skies
en route to Los Angeles today.</i>

669
00:45:43,922 --> 00:45:45,357
<i>It should be a pleasant day.</i>

670
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:48,710
<i>82 degrees and clear,
with a light Santa Ana wind.</i>



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
