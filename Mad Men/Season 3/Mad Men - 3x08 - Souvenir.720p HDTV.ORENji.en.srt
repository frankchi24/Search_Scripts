4
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,800
I've prepared all of your correspondence
And the summaries are here for you to go over.

5
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,300
You can put them down.

6
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,600
Well, it's just--

7
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,400
- It's 5:00.
- Sorry about that.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
You probably want to be leaving.

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,300
What are you up to?

10
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,500
Well, some of the girls from here And
the traveler's insurance got a place in saltaire.

11
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,900
- Mosquitoes.
- They don't bother me.

12
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,900
Some people they bother.
Some people they don't.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,900
- I'm just one of those people.
- A thing like that.

14
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,600
Is he making you work
because he's got no place to go?

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,600
No.

16
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,700
Have a wonderful weekend, dear.

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
Why is it that a man on
his own is an object of pity

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,900
When she's the one you
should really feel sorry for?

19
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,700
I don't feel sorry for her.
Those girls do whatever they want.

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Still working, campbell?
There's no reason to show off.

21
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,900
Cooper's in montana,
sterling's in jane

22
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,600
- And draper's on vacation.
- He's not on vacation.

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,500
He's been in dallas,
denver or something.

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,700
Hilton sent him
to every armpit that he has.

25
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,600
I'd like to get out of town
in august once-- Even for work.

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
I love this time of year.

27
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,100
It's quiet.

28
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,900
It used to be like this
When i was a kid all the time.

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,400
I'd lie in bed at night,
hear horses going by.

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,000
New york in august--
It's like a great big melting wax museum.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,100
Nothing but those fat girls with the hairy
armpits Putting their feet in the fountain.

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,700
You know what? My weekend
doesn't look so bad now.

33
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,200
I'll take anybody
for a drink who wants one.

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,900
I poured you a beer.

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
If you were wondering,
there's a hathaway in there.

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
The hotel gave me
someone else's shirt.

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,000
Then you should complain to mr. Hilton.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,700
They should be paying you for this.

39
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,200
There's a hearing, And i'm
paid well enough already.

40
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,700
What are they doing out there?

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,600
Catching lightning bugs.

42
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,700
You should join them.

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,500
Yes, this is elizabeth draper From the junior
league of tarrytown Calling for mrs. Howard englewood.

44
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,800
We're trying to save
The pleasantville road reservoir.

45
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,400
When do you expect them back?

46
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,300
Oh, that's no good.

47
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,500
Yes, have a good evening.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,500
Uh, draper residence.

49
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Just a minute. Don.

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,100
Come on, don. It's for you.

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,500
It's mr. Hilton's office.

52
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,300
This is don.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay. When?

54
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,100
Tuesday night.

55
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,700
Pan am.
Sure, send it to my office.

56
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,000
You as well.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
Where are you going now?

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,800
He wants me to fly out tuesday night
And join him in rome.

59
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,100
Rome?

60
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,200
Well, that's a lot
better than dallas.

61
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Not for two days, it isn't.

62
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,500
I'll see the coliseum from a taxi cab.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
We should've gone to
the beach for the summer.

64
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
You've been gone the whole time anyway.

65
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,400
First of all, that's not true.

66
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,300
Second, there's nothing
stopping you from coming with me.

67
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,800
You have a passport.

68
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,000
I guess our two-Month-Old isn't an issue.

69
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,300
We can stay at the waldorf
anytime we want.

70
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Because that's just like rome.

71
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,300
Sorry.

72
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,800
I've gotta catch up on my sleep.

73
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,500
Are you okay?

74
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,300
Are you trying to get that in or out?

75
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,600
It's stuck.

76
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,400
You work for the lawrences, right?

77
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,900
I'm very sorry.

78
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,900
You're their au pair, aren't you?

79
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,800
Yes, but they will send me home.

80
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,100
First of all, let's take care of this.

81
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,800
Oh. What happened?

82
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,200
I can't tell you.

83
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,600
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

84
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,300
What's your name?

85
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,000
- Gertrude.
- My name is peter.

86
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm in 14g.

87
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,300
And i'm not going
to get you in trouble.

88
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,000
I have this party, i borrow
her dress And this happened.

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No one can clean and she's coming home.

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,100
So you thought you would throw it away?

91
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,400
They're just going to think you stole it.

92
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,900
Whoa whoa, wait.
Hold on.

93
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,500
I don't think you're thinking clearly.

94
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
You could put it back in the closet

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,600
And when she takes it out,
blame it on the little kids.

96
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,500
- They have a girl, right?
- I would never do this.

97
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,800
When are they coming home?

98
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,900
Uh, thursday.

99
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,600
- Give it to me.
- For what?

100
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,700
Just give it to me.

101
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,300
- Let me see what i can do.
- Are you sure?

102
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,700
And people say new york's not friendly.

103
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,400
Thank you.

104
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,100
I'm not promising anything.

105
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,600
I'll do my best.

106
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Good night.

107
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,800
We've read your statement, mrs. Gumport,

108
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,700
And we appreciate your concern.

109
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,200
So where is he? We're next.

110
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,300
- I don't know.
- Did he say he was coming?

111
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,400
I didn't speak to him exactly.

112
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,100
Maybe he sent a letter,
a proclamation or something.

113
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,200
I believe that completes our old business.

114
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,100
We'll move onto
the new business on the agenda.

115
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,200
We will begin with addressing
the gas station signs On south water street.

116
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,700
Um, excuse me.

117
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,900
I believe there's been a request for discussion
Of the pleasantville road reservoir.

118
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,300
- It's on the agenda.
- Oh.

119
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,900
Somehow that got shifted into new business.

120
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,700
That's definitely old business.

121
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,600
- Who are you exactly?
- She's with me.

122
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,700
I'm mrs. Jack farrelly And we're
representing the junior league of tarrytown.

123
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,800
- Would the trustees please locate the--
- There should be two petitions there.

124
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
- Am i late?
- No, you're just in time.

125
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,800
We have someone who would
like to speak on our behalf.

126
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,800
Yes.

127
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes. Mayor, trustees.

128
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,800
I'm henry francis, governor rockefeller's
Director of public relations and research.

129
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,800
And i've been sent here to deliver this
request On behalf of the governor's office.

130
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Really?

131
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a request that further study is needed,

132
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Because as you know, this project
was initiated Based on an assumption

133
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
that the water quality of
the reservoir is lacking.

134
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,700
I don't think that was
an assumption. There was a study.

135
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,000
With all due respect,

136
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,800
The governor's office believes
that was not conclusive.

137
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,100
- May i see that letter?
- I've brought copies for everyone.

138
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,600
Very well, mr. Francis.

139
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,800
We appreciate
the governor's interest in our hamlet And

140
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,700
do hereby order that development Of the pleasantville
road reservoir be suspended Until further notice.

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,500
Calm down, ladies.

142
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,000
I believe that completes our old business.

143
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We'll move onto
the new business on the agenda.

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
I am so impressed.

145
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,600
- So how long will that report take?
- i have No idea,

146
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,500
But there's a saying in politics--

147
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,100
"When you have no power, delay."

148
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,400
Betty says you're from around here.

149
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Yeah, about three miles that way.

150
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,400
I have to get out of here before Florence esterhazi
comes out and reiterates the financial report.

151
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,200
Oh, i should be getting back as well.

152
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,700
- Are you driving to albany?
- No.

153
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,500
Well, i'm this way.

154
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,500
They say you can't fight city hall.

155
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,200
Good night, francine.

156
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,300
Well, this is me.

157
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,900
No station wagon for you, i guess.

158
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,200
Oh, i have one.
It's just this was my father's.

159
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
I thought it would be good luck.

160
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,500
So.

161
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,600
"So" what?

162
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,800
Nothing.

163
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,300
I'd love to buy you some coffee,
But i don't think there's anyplace open.

164
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,400
I appreciate the offer,
but i should be getting home.

165
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,200
I just wanted to say thank you.

166
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,300
You really...

167
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,000
You really did everything we wanted
And i know how busy you must be.

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,500
Well, i think you'll find that i put my heart
into things When something's important to me.

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,300
Or someone.

170
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
That is a beautiful car.

171
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,700
He loved it.

172
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,400
I saw how happy you were in there.

173
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,300
I was.
I-- I am.

174
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,600
And i thought,

175
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,500
"dear god. Did i have anything to do with that?

176
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Because that would make me happy."

177
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,000
You did.

178
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,900
good night.

179
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,800
??

180
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,600
Do you know what happened
to the hilton cufflinks?

181
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,400
They're little stetsons, sterling silver.

182
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,500
They're in my top drawer.
Bobby was playing with them.

183
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,700
They're fine.

184
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,300
Look at that. How'd it go?

185
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,500
It went very well. We won.

186
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,900
We won, we won, we won.

187
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,300
What time are you leaving?

188
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,000
The car comes at a quarter to 6:00.

189
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,500
- You're leaving from work?
- Yes.

190
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,000
- So they just killed the whole development?
- Not exactly.

191
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,300
We had completely forgotten this, But
there's a man from the governor's office

192
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,100
And he had pointed out
something we had forgotten,

193
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,500
Which was that the whole project was based on
the idea That the water's no good up there anymore,

194
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,300
Which is a lie.
It's not true at all, Not even a little.

195
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,700
They just made it up.

196
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,000
So he ordered another study, You know,
like a chemical analysis of the water.

197
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,700
And that could take years,
So i think they'll move on.

198
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,400
They should just do it up in newburgh.

199
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,200
It's already disgusting.

200
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,100
That's real politics.

201
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Well, you know, when you don't
have any power, You have to delay things.

202
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
Don.

203
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,200
Don.

204
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,500
I'm up. I'm up.

205
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,400
No, it's not time to wake up.

206
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,100
I want to come with you.

207
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,600
Is it too late?

208
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
What? No.

209
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,800
I can buy you a ticket at the airport.

210
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,500
Carla can watch them for a few days.

211
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,900
Sure, why not?

212
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,700
I know you'll be working the whole time,
But i just want to get on a plane.

213
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,700
Pardon me.
Do you work here?

214
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,000
The men's room is exactly here,
one floor down.

215
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,700
No, i don't need the men's room.

216
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,000
I, uh...

217
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,900
I can't return this.
It has this stain here.

218
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,500
I spilled wine on it
and my wife hasn't forgiven me,

219
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,800
And i'd really appreciate
if you could get me out of the doghouse.

220
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm sorry,
but anyone could've sewn a tag on this--

221
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,400
Do i look like someone
who wants to steal a dress?

222
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,200
- I'll pay for it.
- And i was going to say

223
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,300
??? It would be from last season and

224
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,000
i don't know that we still have it.

225
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,500
Let me speak to the manager.

226
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,800
Of the entire store?

227
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,700
Of the republic of dresses--

228
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,600
Whoever can help me with this,
because you're falling short.

229
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,400
Just a minute.

230
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,300
- May i help you?
- Yes, i--

231
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,900
Joan! Is that you?

232
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Yes. Yes, it is.

233
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
How are you?

234
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm well. Thank you.

235
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,000
I was asking for the manager.
I had no idea.

236
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,400
Well, i'm just filling in.
They needed some extra help.

237
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
I get my pick before they get put out.

238
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,400
Isn't that smart?

239
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,500
So how can i help you?

240
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,200
Well, i don't mean to be a bother,

241
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,300
I was just hoping someone could--

242
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,300
It's this dress.

243
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,100
Trudy spilled wine on it.
She's beside herself.

244
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,400
I may have spilled the wine.

245
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,600
I was hoping to exchange it
or replace it,

246
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,200
Whichever will get me out of
the ladies' dresses department.

247
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
May i?

248
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
It is our merchandise.

249
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,100
This one's small.
I don't see trudy in a 10.

250
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,600
It doesn't fit great,
But she loves it.

251
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,500
- It's very--
- It's very summery.

252
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,600
Give me a moment.

253
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,900
Take this down to customer service.

254
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
They'll send someone to the stockroom.

255
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,800
It'lbe boxed up,
but i'm sure we have it.

256
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,900
- I'm willing to pay for it, of course.
- It's all taken care of.

257
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,700
Well, that's very generous.

258
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,400
Thank you.

259
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,500
So how are you?

260
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,800
Never been better.
How are things at the office?

261
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,900
Moneypenny hasn't self-Destructed,
But it's just a matter of time.

262
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,800
And how are you?

263
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,500
I think i told you already.

264
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,600
I'm very well.
Greg is just finishing up his residency.

265
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,400
He's actually thinking
about a new specialty.

266
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,800
You know doctors--
Whatever's the latest thing.

267
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
And what would that be?

268
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,000
Psychiatry.

269
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,100
I'll take the dress and you take that.

270
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,200
Thank you so much
for getting me out of a scrape.

271
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,100
And i'd appreciate it If you should
happen to run into trudy That you be discreet.

272
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,600
The whole incident was
fraught with drama.

273
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,000
Of course.

274
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,100
This never happened.

275
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,300
Nice to see you again.

276
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,400
Wow.

277
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,400
It's beautiful.

278
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,300
What is that smell?

279
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,200
Which one?

280
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,100
It's like rubber and diesel.

281
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,900
I can barely stand up.

282
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
Let me see what's going on.

283
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,600
Grazie.

284
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,600
"I hope you find everything
to your liking, madame.

285
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,800
Your italian is very good."

286
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,700
"Thank you very much.
It's a lovely room."

287
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,800
Sorry. I haven't changed my money yet.

288
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,700
Oh, no, signore. Thank you.
American dollar is very good.

289
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,900
Thank you.

290
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,400
$2, don? That's what
he makes in a week.

291
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,100
Oh. Don, look.

292
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,000
???

293
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm sorry. Is this the drapers' room?

294
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,600
- Yes, this is mrs. Draper.
- Is it?

295
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,400
Well, it's high time i got to meet you.

296
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
This must be mr. Hilton.

297
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,000
Connie. Please.

298
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,000
- Welcome to rome.
- Thank you. I'm happy to be here.

299
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,300
I want you to put my staff through its paces.

300
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,900
No complaint's too small.

301
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,400
I'd kick you up to a suite,

302
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,300
But i want don to see the way
this works for most people.

303
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,100
- It's lovely.
- When i see you tonight,

304
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,100
I want to hear all about it.

305
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
"Good morning.

306
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,500
No, of course.
Good afternoon.

307
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,100
I'd like to get an appointment
at the beauty salon."

308
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,000
I so so appreciate this.
It's an hour or two at the most.

309
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,300
The board is trying to
jap us with a sudden meeting.

310
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,500
Ernie, i'm leaving!

311
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
"One asti spumante, please."

312
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,400
Oh, you're drinking alone.

313
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,300
This is in rome.
Not in the law, eh?

314
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,600
"But it's legal to bother a woman?"

315
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,700
- "You speak italian very well."
- "Thank you."

316
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,100
"What are you doing tonight?
I'll show you the city."

317
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,900
"He'll show you the city.

318
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,800
He's not roman. He's a bumpkin."

319
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,000
- "Where are you from?"
- "Naples."

320
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,400
"It's so beautiful. Like you."

321
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,500
"Thank you."

322
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,400
"If i were that cigarette in your mouth,

323
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I would die of happiness."

324
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,300
"You are not a gentleman."

325
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,900
Whiskey, neat.

326
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,500
- May i join you?
- Hey, yankee.

327
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,000
Hey, go home.

328
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,000
It's an american millionaire.

329
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,400
"He's old. And he's ugly."

330
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,800
- Are they making fun of me?
- A little bit.

331
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,700
I'm only in rome for one night.

332
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,400
I won't have my heart broken.

333
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,400
Room 763.

334
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,600
That's right near my room.

335
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,300
Good night, signorina.

336
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,800
To whatever they were saying.

337
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,700
They said you were ugly.

338
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,700
Does that bother you?

339
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,300
You think because of the way
i'm dressed That i'm shallow?

340
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,600
I was just hoping you were easy.

341
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,100
They said that too.

342
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,400
What brings you to rome?

343
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,000
Seen anything interesting?

344
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,300
I could take it or leave it.

345
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,900
Well, look at the lovebirds, will you?

346
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,900
Connie, this is my wife betty.

347
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,000
By golly, you are an indecently lucky man.

348
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,300
By golly, he's nutty.

349
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,800
He's something.

350
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,900
He adores you.

351
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,100
You're tiny.

352
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,700
He does.

353
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,600
Now i can see
what all the fuss has been about.

354
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,700
He sees great things in you.

355
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,200
- Where are we going?
- We're going for ice cream.

356
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,000
That's a grand idea.

357
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,900
Close your window.
My hair is getting mussed.

358
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,400
- How was your day?
- Okay.

359
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,400
- Do i look pretty?
- I guess so.

360
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
- Hey, what are you doing?
- * sally and ernie sitting in a tree *

361
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,400
- * k-I-S-S-I-N-G... *
- Shut up!

362
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
- I mean it!

363
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,900

364
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,000
- Stop it!
- Ow!

365
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I said shut up!

366
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,400
Hey hey hey!
That's enough!

367
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,100
- She hurt me.
- He hit me first.

368
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,500
- She was kissing ernie.
- I was not!

369
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,100
All right!
Both of you-- Separate rooms.

370
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,500
I'm not gonna let ernie
and jessica visit anymore.

371
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Well, aren't you a lucky girl?

372
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,700
Go ahead. Open it.
Make sure it's right.

373
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,500
- It's like new!
- They just exchanged it.

374
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,200
No questions asked.

375
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,100
Thank you. Thank you,
mr. Peter, from my heart.

376
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,400
I promise i never do this again.

377
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,500
It's all right.
It never happened.

378
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,600
We should celebrate.

379
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,500
- I don't know.
- What do you like to drink?

380
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,100
You're german, right?
I can get us some beer or riesling.

381
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,700
Schnapps?

382
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,100
Oh, you are so nice,

383
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,400
But i have my boyfriend.

384
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,700
Oh.

385
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,600
Thank you so much
to do this for me.

386
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,000
Glad i could help.

387
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,200
Good night.

388
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,800
Oh, i woke you.

389
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,300
What do you want?

390
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,800
Well, i went to a lot of trouble
To solve your dress problem

391
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,500
And i think i at least
deserve to see it on you.

392
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
Okay, but you have to be very quiet.

393
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,600
- This is cozy.
- I'll go get the dress.

394
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,000
??

395
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,700
- Hello?
- Did i wake you?

396
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
No. No, i'm up.

397
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,100
Can i interest you two
in some breakfast?

398
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,500
Breakfast?
Sure, let me just--

399
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,000
Stay.

400
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,300
You know, connie,

401
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,700
betty's telling me She already
ordered breakfast up to the room.

402
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,000
- Can i meet you afterwards?
- Of course.

403
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,400
You let me know how
you like the room service.

404
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,600
Did you hear the bells this morning?

405
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,800
I did.

406
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,600
I like sleeping on this side of the bed.

407
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,700
- I have to get up.
- Tsk. Aww.

408
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,400
Order something.
He wants a full report.

409
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,900
Well, hello.

410
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,900
Welcome home.

411
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,400
How was everybody?

412
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,700
Everyone's fine.
How was your trip?

413
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,100
It was short but sweet.

414
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,500
Well, good.

415
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,600
I'm going to get my things.

416
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,300
Just one more thing--

417
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,600
You might want to talk to sally.

418
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
- Why?
- She'll tell you.

419
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,800
Carla, you brought it up.

420
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,400
I keep talking to her
about that temper.

421
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,300
I'm gonna go check the mail.
Do you want anything?

422
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,300
She kissed ernie hanson,
bobby was teasing her

423
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,800
And she really went after him.

424
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,900
Okay. It's okay.

425
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,100
Thank you for telling me.

426
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,000
I think they just missed you.

427
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,000
Wouldn't that be nice?

428
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,200
Well, i missed you.
You know that?

429
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,300
Mr. Campbell.
Ed lawrence. 14c.

430
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,700
Yes, of course.
How are you, ed?

431
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,400
Is your wife at home?

432
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,100
No.

433
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,700
Can i come in for a minute?

434
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,800
Of course.

435
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
What are you drinking, ed?

436
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,500
Oh, i have a martini waiting next door.

437
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,300
Let me make this quick.

438
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,200
You know we have this
german au pair working for us?

439
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,900
No, i didn't know that.

440
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Yes, you do.

441
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,400
- I don't know what she said--
- Please, just relax.

442
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,100
I know it's august
and all the cats are away,

443
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,200
But i just spent one of my precious
vacation days Refilling the kleenex boxes.

444
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,200
- I don't understand.
- Would you drop it?

445
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,200
I've had four months without any tears,
mr. Campbell-- Four quiet months.

446
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,100
You know how hard it is to find
someone my wife can get along with?

447
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,600
And now this.

448
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,700
Look.

449
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,200
There are plenty of nannies
in this neighborhood.

450
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,600
Stay away from her.

451
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,800
In fact, be smart--
Stay out of the building.

452
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,100
- I'm very sorry.
- It'll be fine.

453
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,300
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

454
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,700
- Bobby, sit down.
- Mayday mayday.

455
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,700
Daddy doesn't know,

456
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,800
But carla told me you were
fighting while we were gone.

457
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,300
Sally.

458
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,700
Carla was very upset.

459
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,800
It's not fair.
I didn't do anything.

460
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,500
That's it. You apologize to bobby
And you learn to control your temper,

461
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,600
Or i'm going to have to
start taking things away.

462
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,200
I'm sorry i hit you.

463
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,900
That's okay.

464
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,100
I called the office. Hilton sent
a packet over before we even left.

465
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
I'm sorry.

466
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,500
- Going swimming?
- Are we?

467
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Yes.

468
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,500
See you tonight.

469
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,100
Yes, but what you really would've enjoyed
Was watching my father struggle with the sailboat.

470
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Oh. Well, hello.

471
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,200
Hello.

472
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Is everybody having a good summer?

473
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,600
Very nice.
Very hot.

474
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,900
I see marta came.

475
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,500
Or did you keep it
this way yourself?

476
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,300
I did my best.

477
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,500
My little bachelor.
Come over here.

478
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,600
I missed you.

479
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,300
I missed ever part of you.

480
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,400
- Trudy, i have to get to work.
- Oh, i don't care.

481
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,200
Oh. Peter.

482
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,900
You always get that guilty look on
your face When we see little children.

483
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,400
I told you--

484
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,300
I don't care.

485
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,800
You're my husband, I want what you want.

486
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,000
Did you miss me?
A little?

487
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,400
What's wrong?

488
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,100
I can't.

489
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,500
Peter.

490
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,600
Look at me.
Did something happen?

491
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,300
- Sally, get down here.
- Coming.

492
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,700
I want you to know that i think
ernie hanson is a very nice little boy,

493
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,400
But i don't want you running
around Just kissing boys.

494
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,200
- I wasn't.
- And you don't kiss boys.

495
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,700
Boys kiss you.

496
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,300
The first kiss is very special.

497
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,900
But i already did it.
It's over.

498
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,000
You're going to have
a lot of first kisses.

499
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,700
You're going to want it
to be special, So you remember.

500
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,400
It's where you go from being
a stranger to knowing someone,

501
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,200
And every kiss with him after
that is a shadow of that kiss.

502
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,800
Do you understand?

503
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,900
I think so.

504
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,100
Go play.

505
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

506
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,100
I made some cold salads--
Hearts of palm, Tomatoes, olives.

507
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,700
Wonderful.

508
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,100
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

509
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,800
I walked down lexington
and they opened a new fruit market,

510
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,200
But other than the melons,
most of it was unremarkable.

511
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,200
So i stopped in butterfield market
And they had all of the stone fruits,

512
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,500
And beautiful cherries and i thought...

513
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,200
- Trudy
- ...maybe i'd make a fruit salad for dessert.

514
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,600
What?

515
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,500
I don't want you to go away
anymore without me.

516
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,200
Good.

517
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,500
I won't.

518
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,400
Tell me--
What happened at work today?

519
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,300
Well,

520
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,900
kinsey invented some contraption That
can shoot a water balloon across the office.

521
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,500
We filled it with ketchup.

522
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Did you?

523
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,700
I have $5 for carla.

524
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,300
She watched the kids for me.

525
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,000
The board called a secret meeting
about the reservoir.

526
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,100
- I think they reversed us.
- Really?

527
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,600
We'll see.

528
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,900
So... did you go to the catacombs?

529
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,300
No.

530
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,900
Throw a coin in the fountain?

531
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,700
You did have a good time, didn't you?

532
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,500
Do you want some?

533
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,800
The kids didn't eat it at all.
I put them to bed.

534
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,800
Hm-Mmm.

535
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,600
Carlton and i went to lake george
for a week after jess was born.

536
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,400
No problems, no kids.

537
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,100
It was magical.

538
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,600
We have to do that again.

539
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,400
I'm afraid we may have to
be vigilant About the reservoir.

540
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:38,300
Although it'd be an excuse For you
to get more help from high places.

541
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,900
I'm done with that.
We made our stand.

542
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,200
Mmm, sunny madrid.

543
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,700
Doesn't that sound like
it would do the trick?

544
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,600
I've never been.

545
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,500
- Welcome home.
- Hello, francine.

546
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,400
Well, i should be going.

547
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,300
From what i hear,
you two must be very tired.

548
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,000
Good night, francine.

549
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,600
Hey.

550
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Don't.

551
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,400
- What's wrong?
- "What's wrong?"

552
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,700
I hate this place.
I hate our friends.

553
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,400
- I hate this town.
- Oh, betts.

554
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,200
We'll go away again.
You know we will.

555
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,500
Do me a favor--
Look on your pillow.

556
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Open it.

557
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,700
I saw it in the gift shop

558
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,200
But we were leaving,
so i had connie send it.

559
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,400
It's lovely.

560
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,900
I'll have it put on your bracelet.

561
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,100
And i can have something to look at

562
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,200
When i tell the story
about the time we went to rome.
