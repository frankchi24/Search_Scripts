00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:06,033
<i>muter for bierdopje.eu</i>

2
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,912
- Aww.
- Is there more?

3
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:13,182
- I love her.
- I saw susan watson do it on broadway.

4
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,051
She was great, but she didn't have that.

5
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,988
Well, it's not going to be her, but they
want that scene frame for frame, as they say.

6
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,292
So something about how
desperate she is for a pepsi?

7
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,477
It's for pepsi, but it's not for pepsi.

8
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:30,582
It's called patio and it's a dieter's
kind of pepsi to help women reduce.

9
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:35,170
<i>It's pepsi's diet-rite cola and there's
claims that their lawyers went over--</i>

10
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,172
Calories, etcetera,

11
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,841
If we do it right, we land patio.

12
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,444
And if we land patio, I'll
be at lunch with pepsi.

13
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,580
I think pete campbell just broke a sweat.

14
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,465
I'm coming to casting.

15
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,100
We're going right to casting?

16
00:02:48,184 --> 00:02:50,569
You don't have to if you don't want to.

17
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:53,405
I understand why you like
this, but it's not for you.

18
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:54,957
I'm the one who would be buying patio.

19
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:56,475
You're not fat anymore.

20
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,894
Thank you.

21
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:01,763
Let's assume we can't
talk them out of the name

22
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:03,532
And let's assume we can get a girl

23
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:06,501
Who can match ann margret's
ability to be 25 and act 14.

24
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:08,003
Is that what she's doing?

25
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,240
Is it just a knock-off?

26
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,442
Are we allowed to make fun of it, at least?

27
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:15,327
She's fun and sexy. Don't be a prude.

28
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,547
Would you say that to me?

29
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:20,766
It's sexy, and it's what they want.

30
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,619
Clients don't always know what's best.

31
00:03:23,653 --> 00:03:26,822
When we land them, you can
start talking to them that way.

32
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,008
Pick it up.

33
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,793
Bobby, back away from the stove.

34
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,033
We're out of melba toast.

35
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,335
Well, jesus, betts,

36
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,304
Have some oatmeal. That
baby's gonna weigh a pound.

37
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:45,474
Carla must have had some, because
I would have thrown the box away.

38
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,045
Are we gonna collect the whole set?

39
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,097
I thought you didn't mind
her doing the legwork.

40
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:53,966
You didn't need a decorator last time.

41
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,934
I'd like to feel like
I'm paying for something.

42
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:58,153
These are $3 apiece, you know.

43
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,955
And I can't really judge by a picture.

44
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,594
- I'm late.
- We should really spend a day in tarrytown.

45
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:07,980
- It'd be so easy.
- No.

46
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,066
- Those stores smell bad.
- We are going to tarrytown...

47
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,870
And you're going to stare at
some antique chair for so long

48
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,390
The buttons are gonna seem interesting,
and then we'll go to carvel.

49
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,412
See you tonight.

50
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,598
What are you doing?

51
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,068
I hope you received the
package showing our campaign

52
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,854
To ease the way for the
ravenswood nuclear power facility.

53
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,790
Kinsey was responsible for that.

54
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:37,759
Almost a year and nary a peep of opposition.

55
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:41,530
- It was very impressive.
- I've told paul that you're facing an onslaught

56
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:44,283
Of negative public opinion
in your attempt to demolish

57
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,752
The pennsylvania railroad station this year

58
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:49,371
And replace it with the
new madison square garden.

59
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:52,407
We should've torn the damn thing
down during the newspaper strike.

60
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,543
No one would have noticed.

61
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:57,045
Now let's take a look at
the landscape, as it were.

62
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:00,582
"Save penn station."

63
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,021
"Save penn station."

64
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,342
"Rape on 34th street."

65
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,212
"Stop fascism!"

66
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,234
"How to kill a city. Architects' inhumanity

67
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:21,737
To architects surpasses understanding.

68
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:24,006
The new design is also ambitious,

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,791
Pedestrian and dull."

70
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,261
Ada louise huxtable is
as green as that folder.

71
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:31,680
People know that she's an
angry woman with a big mouth.

72
00:05:31,714 --> 00:05:33,515
Who writes for "the new york times."

73
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,784
I don't care if she wrote
for the 10 commandments.

74
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,855
She's trying to sell papers doing what
they always do-- making people miserable.

75
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,458
My great-great-grandfather, silus
stagman, would have turned his boat around

76
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:46,461
If he had known that this city would
one day be filled with crybabies.

77
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:51,466
So what's your best weapon against lunatics?

78
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,869
15 stories, vaulted ceilings,

79
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:55,821
Pink milford
granite columns--

80
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:59,624
I don't think it's crazy to be
attached to a beaux-arts masterpiece

81
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,309
Through which teddy roosevelt came and went.

82
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:04,579
I've met the opposition. I know crazy.

83
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:08,500
Do you know where the
greatest roman ruins are?

84
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:11,086
They're in greece, Spain,

85
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,555
Because the romans tore theirs all down.

86
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:16,424
They took apart the coliseum
to build their outhouses.

87
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:19,161
This is the coliseum.
Have you seen the plans?

88
00:06:19,195 --> 00:06:21,129
In "the new york times."

89
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,665
Do you have a problem, buddy?

90
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,133
He's looking for an angle.

91
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:29,237
You know those snide ad
men you see in the movies?

92
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:31,039
Right here.

93
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:34,876
Well, I've got a mailbox
full of death threats

94
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,145
From beatniks like him who'd
rather live in a teepee.

95
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:39,247
This is the greatest city in the world.

96
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:40,449
If you don't like it, leave.

97
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,006
Well, we'll let you know.

98
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,828
You have no problems with an atom plant

99
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:54,463
On the east river, but this bothers you?

100
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:58,833
It's penn station. This city has no memory.

101
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,019
Out with the old, in with the
new-- who says that's a good idea?

102
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:03,271
I'm going to have to talk to don about this.

103
00:07:05,307 --> 00:07:07,109
Don't do that.

104
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:12,080
Look.  Now they'll trust me more

105
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:13,548
When I help them.

106
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,817
Do you ever listen to yourself?

107
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,204
I hate you. You know that.

108
00:07:19,288 --> 00:07:20,855
Other than wilma flintstone,

109
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,491
I haven't seen anyone carry so well.

110
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,161
It's smoke and mirrors.
I've busted plenty of seams.

111
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,430
Well, it makes me optimistic.

112
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:30,498
Greg has made it perfectly clear

113
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,935
That come July 1 and he's chief
resident, I'd better watch out.

114
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,572
- Hello, mrs. Draper.
- Can you get mrs. Draper a glass of water?

115
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:40,208
Why don't you tell me first
how long I'm going to be here?

116
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:43,812
What's so urgent? London bridge falling down?

117
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:45,647
In a manner of speaking.

118
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,568
I appreciate you stopping by.

119
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,953
Didn't you just call us to your office?

120
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:54,890
Well, yes. I thought it
best if I told you in person.

121
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,725
I just heard
from london--

122
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,577
We've been sacked by
campbell soup, great britain.

123
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:00,829
I don't want to have to walk down here

124
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,831
Every time we lose an account.

125
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:05,217
This is an advertising agency.

126
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,801
I'll wear out the carpet.

127
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,242
It's not so much the account we lost

128
00:08:14,276 --> 00:08:16,544
As the account we failed to gain.

129
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,847
So now b.B.D.O. Has all of campbell's soup?

130
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:20,649
Why didn't we have a meeting with them?

131
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:23,118
Perhaps I should drag burt
peterson in and fire him again?

132
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,354
Obviously don would've loved the shot.

133
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,423
How did this slip through the cracks?

134
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,526
I don't usually set meetings, I attend them.

135
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,161
Well, if this is where we wanted to end up,

136
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:34,796
We all did everything perfectly.

137
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,299
You ever get three sheets to
the wind and try that thing on?

138
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,287
<i>Mrs. Pryce is here.</i>

139
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:44,439
Nothing to fret about as
long as there's new business.

140
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,041
Five minutes?

141
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:56,351
It's definitely side to side.

142
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:57,986
Is that a boy or a girl?

143
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,938
I'll call my mother.

144
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:04,326
Oh, look. Princess grace
just swallowed a basketball.

145
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,162
- How are you, roger?
- It's not hard to adjust to happiness.

146
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,631
Shall we?

147
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,849
Good night, mrs. Harris.

148
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,821
I'm in a foul mood.

149
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:38,310
Chateau lafite rothschild '49.

150
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,545
I'm very impressed that you have this.

151
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,364
Not bad at that.

152
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:49,187
- Where are you living?
- Oh, we have a finished flat in sutton place.

153
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:51,856
Three bedrooms, spectacular
view of the river.

154
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:55,327
And we're near the u.N., so
there's plenty of africans.

155
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:02,851
Like the bourdeaux grape, may
we all get better with time.

156
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,841
This is delicious.

157
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:13,594
Rebecca was curious if you
knew anything about schools.

158
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,498
In the city, I'm a little out of touch.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,267
How long have you been together?

160
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,802
- 10 years.
- Nine years.

161
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,189
15 for us.

162
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,795
- Do you miss london?
- God, yes.

163
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,765
But what we lost in london
we gained in insects.

164
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:41,172
J walter thompson is
opening an office in caracas.

165
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:43,391
I don't know if the ladies
want to talk about that.

166
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,894
No, of course not.

167
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,782
Ah, the cookie. Brilliant.

168
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:56,721
Look, I didn't want to be
there any more than you did.

169
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:59,474
It was just the cherry on top of my sundae.

170
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,514
What?

171
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,850
Tell me now and not three
seconds after I've dozed off.

172
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,988
I've been trying to get
my father on the phone.

173
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,563
Of course I called william
and, again, something's wrong.

174
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:27,085
- Another stroke?
- Gloria left him.

175
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:28,903
Can you blame her?

176
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:30,972
Yes, I can blame her.

177
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:33,241
She came into his life,

178
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,276
He suddenly takes ill and she abandons him.

179
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:39,247
Maybe she realized he's a son of a bitch.

180
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:43,651
Don, I'm worried about him.

181
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,121
He doesn't sound right,

182
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:48,656
And I can't take a car trip now.

183
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,646
I think william and judy should
bring him up this weekend.

184
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:57,282
Great, more antiques.

185
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,968
It's spring break. It'll
be nice for the kids.

186
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:02,520
Those girls are a nightmare.

187
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,472
They'll leave by Saturday at the latest.

188
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:11,012
Why did you even bother asking me?

189
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,084
She's really kicking.

190
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:27,328
<i>Mr. Sterling, your family is here.</i>

191
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,297
Send them in.

192
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,435
If it isn't fall bride.

193
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,607
- Where's brooks?
- He'll be along.

194
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,510
- Would anyone like anything? Coffee or
- It's 10:30.

195
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,065
Sherry if you have it.

196
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,985
I told brooks to come late.

197
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,037
I don't want him to be embarrassed.

198
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:55,473
By what, that I'm paying for anything?

199
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:57,559
You just tell him...

200
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,661
That's the way it's done.

201
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,046
No, roger, it's about jane.

202
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:05,750
What about her? It was her
idea to take you to dior.

203
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:08,303
Why haven't you returned her calls?

204
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,605
You're hurting her feelings.

205
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,274
I know what you think.

206
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:16,628
You think it's so uncomfortable
that I won't even bring it up.

207
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,414
Well, you're being very dramatic for a
girl who didn't want a wedding at all.

208
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,966
Do you want me to say
it? Do I have to say it?

209
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,737
- Say what exactly?
- I suggested to margaret a compromise.

210
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:27,755
You and jane host your own table

211
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:29,090
And I'll be at the hargroves'.

212
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,092
So you get the in-laws and I get siberia.

213
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:35,780
Are you worried about an odd number?

214
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:37,966
- Because I'll get your mother a date.
- I have a date.

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,335
- Who?
- Bruce pike.

216
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:42,470
What does that old saddlebag want?

217
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:45,023
I didn't want to go to
her wedding, but I did.

218
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:47,642
The least she can do is not come to mine.

219
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,979
- Not come?
- That's why I suggested a compromise.

220
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,947
You're not even giving jane a chance.

221
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,233
Seeing her on my wedding
day is gonna ruin it.

222
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:57,819
She's young enough to be my sister.

223
00:13:57,853 --> 00:13:59,187
<i>How does it look?</i>

224
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,340
- Sweetheart.
- Brooks!  Thank god.

225
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,708
Mom.

226
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:09,230
- How are you, sir?
- Not great, brooks. Not great.

227
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,816
Can I get you something?

228
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:14,769
- Uh, no.
- That's okay. I'll have yours.

229
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,372
- Roger.
- We're not married anymore, you know.

230
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,842
I like the silver and the bells.

231
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,681
Go with the bells.

232
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,000
November 23rd.

233
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,885
I'll tell jane.

234
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,892
<i>Mr. Pryce is here to see you.</i>

235
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,947
<i>Send him in.</i>

236
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,768
Your wife is charming.

237
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,472
She lifted rebecca's spirits inestimably.

238
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:54,475
I'm glad to hear it. They really hit it off.

239
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:58,112
Uh, I hate to send you into the lion's den,

240
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,048
But I think it best you take the gentleman

241
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:02,617
From madison square garden
to a nice lunch today.

242
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,303
Peter and paul rubbed him
very much the wrong way.

243
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,789
I told you before roger's the lion tamer.

244
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,507
Roger will join as well.

245
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,676
It will help if you tell
me who these people are.

246
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,779
All I could secure was edgar raffit,

247
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:17,248
Vice president of madison square garden,

248
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,002
- And he's irate.
- What does he want?

249
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,172
A cyrano de bergerac to make
new york fall in love with him.

250
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:28,109
- Today?
- Do you have plans?

251
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,081
Have campbell send over the folder.

252
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,659
Wild indians.

253
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,495
They've been cooped up since woodbridge.

254
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,430
I fixed some lunch.

255
00:15:51,466 --> 00:15:53,451
Cold roast chicken or I have cold cuts.

256
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,370
We went to pat's steaks.

257
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,873
I got you a half.

258
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,508
Have you all already eaten?

259
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,428
No, we waited.

260
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,864
I even got gloria a chicken parmesan.

261
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:09,617
Well, great. We'll mail it to her.

262
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,055
She's in boca raton. She's not coming back.

263
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,945
He understands completely.
He's just playing it up.

264
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:26,017
- How was the drive, daddy?
- In the lincoln?

265
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,405
You should take your
coumadin with your sandwich.

266
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:42,734
So I said to them, "it's so crowded
in here I feel like I'm on the subway."

267
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:45,586
I've never seen anyone like you on the train.

268
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,022
<i>Well, my husband won't let
me. It's a figure of speech.</i>

269
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,925
Have a seat and I'll let mr.
Pryce know that you're here.

270
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,810
Sorry about that.

271
00:17:08,844 --> 00:17:11,179
- I got tied up.
- What else do you have to do today?

272
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:12,964
What else do you have to do all week?

273
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:15,116
I barely made it here.

274
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:17,685
Ginger presses the buzzer,
says "your family's here."

275
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,304
Terribly silly. Gibson, up.

276
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:23,524
Like that's gonna help.

277
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,878
To my knees, don. They're
bringing me to my knees.

278
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:29,230
Sorry to hear that.

279
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:31,999
I made my bed, I should lie in it, right?

280
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,335
Your words, not mine.

281
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:41,476
Like it's not hard enough losing
my little girl to that kid.

282
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,747
I've got her mother
pouring poison in her ear.

283
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:47,582
There's a land grab going on.

284
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:55,623
I blame mona.

285
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,660
All of a sudden, I could give
two craps about that wedding.

286
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:01,929
All I want to do is win.

287
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,264
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

288
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,152
A pleasure to meet you. Roger sterling.

289
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,805
- Ed raffit.
- Our creative director don draper.

290
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,073
- Edgar.
- Have a seat, please.

291
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,675
Let's get you fixed up.

292
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,346
I only have a minute.

293
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,148
Edgar, please.

294
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,866
Eat our sweetmeats, drink our wine.

295
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,538
I understand one of our copywriters

296
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:30,174
Took a yetta wallenda
- sized misstep.

297
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:35,113
The girl, the tightrope walker.

298
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,697
They got her off the sidewalk
with a hose last week.

299
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,102
The point is we completely
understand your problem.

300
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:43,121
All we want to know is how we can help.

301
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,639
You're supposed to tell me.

302
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,359
Well, I've done all I can.  Don?

303
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,330
In the interest of time,

304
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,665
You want to demolish penn
station and new york hates it.

305
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,218
Not all of new york, a vocal minority.

306
00:18:57,252 --> 00:18:59,187
Can they stop it?

307
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:02,406
Well, I think all the hubbub
is making it unpleasant for--

308
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,192
But they can't stop it, can they?

309
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:09,330
Why do you people insist on
making us sound like villains?

310
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,550
Your concern over public opinion
shows a guilty conscience.

311
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:14,835
Now what good is that serving you

312
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:17,071
If what is to be done is already underway?

313
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:18,773
Leave those.

314
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,660
Bring a couple of iceberg wedges,

315
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,078
Bleu cheese, bacon.

316
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:28,566
So let's say I don't
have a guilty conscience.

317
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,787
Good.  And let's also say that
change is neither good or bad,

318
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,856
It simply is.

319
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,208
It can be greeted
with terror or joy--

320
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,294
A tantrum that says "I
want it the way it was"

321
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:44,098
Or a dance that says
"look.  It's something new."

322
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,134
Would you draw the line at 50%?

323
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:48,936
I'm not drawing a line at all.

324
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:51,238
P.R. People understand this,

325
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,807
But they can never execute it.

326
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:54,425
If you don't like what is being said,

327
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,112
Change the conversation.

328
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:08,723
What is that conversation?

329
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:13,961
I was in california.

330
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,263
Everything is new and it's clean.

331
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,616
The people are filled with hope.

332
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,802
New york city is in decay.

333
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:25,473
Madison square garden

334
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,393
Is the beginning of a new city on the hill.

335
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,246
- Just like that?
- It's true, isn't it?

336
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,483
If I were to come to you,

337
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,753
I don't want that
kid on my account--

338
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,671
The communist, the radical.

339
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,757
I will handle it personally.

340
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,244
<i>What's the matter, poko?</i>

341
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,862
Grandpa gene is gonna watch his program now.

342
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,433
I just want to catch the end of the game.

343
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,218
<i>Bleach, poko?</i>

344
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,554
Move.

345
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:59,390
<i>Now the 2-2 delivery is high
and away and it's ball three.</i>

346
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:03,027
<i>A full count 3 and 2.</i>

347
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,753
Daddy seems well. He has an appetite.

348
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,222
Oh, he eats constantly.

349
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,025
When I found out gloria was
gone, I was hoping he ate her.

350
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:20,995
How could you not know about that?

351
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:22,930
I went by, but he lied to me.

352
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:26,017
Then finally, when I let
myself in, he went bananas.

353
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:28,335
He's ashamed.

354
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:31,489
- Judy can get through to him.
- He's down in the dumps,

355
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:33,741
But he seems very clear-headed.

356
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,409
That's not true, judy, and you know it.

357
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:38,412
He's angry and he's in and out.

358
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,819
There is this place--
the parker home.

359
00:21:44,853 --> 00:21:47,355
It's midway between us in new brunswick.

360
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,092
And what happens there?

361
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:54,995
He lives there. It's got
everything, plus doctors.

362
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:59,266
It's expensive, but I thought
maybe we could sell our house.

363
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,370
That would give him enough to live on.

364
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,405
That's very generous.

365
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:09,427
Do you think he belongs in a home?

366
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:12,897
- Betty, I know I don't get a vote.
- Neither does don.

367
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:14,932
All you care about is the house.

368
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:17,068
You want to walk in there,

369
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:18,903
See daddy on the bottom of the stairs

370
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:21,839
And have his last words be "take the house."

371
00:22:27,863 --> 00:22:30,614
Fine, betts. What's the solution?

372
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,667
Those homes are for people who
don't have families, william.

373
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:36,220
He's a lonely old man and he's not well.

374
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:38,205
He's your father.

375
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:05,132
- Gene.
- Thanks for the ritzy accommodations.

376
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,367
You're an army man, gene.

377
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,588
Drop your socks and grab something.

378
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:27,855
Lights out at 8:15. I'm impressed.

379
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:29,723
I wish you would hang
your coat up downstairs.

380
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,991
It's covered with soot.

381
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,102
How bad is he?

382
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:43,187
He's not the problem.

383
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:45,806
What am I saying? He's
the whole problem--

384
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:48,843
That and william's never-ending bullshit.

385
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,744
What now?

386
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:52,880
He wants to put him in an old folks home.

387
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:54,548
Well, I understand it's not ideal,

388
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:57,118
But it is the next logical step.

389
00:23:57,152 --> 00:23:59,286
Don, he just wants the house.

390
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,822
<i>He keeps nailing himself to the cross.</i>

391
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,824
For all I know, judy's pushing him.

392
00:24:07,593 --> 00:24:10,446
Cut it out.

393
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:16,537
What do you want to do?

394
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:21,475
How can he talk that way to
me in the condition I'm in?

395
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:26,347
- Do you want anything?
- Just throw it on the chair and stay here.

396
00:24:35,323 --> 00:24:37,341
Be careful.

397
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:39,593
I'm fine.

398
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,193
It's so funny--
how she is.

399
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:59,413
My father and her fought constantly.

400
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:01,982
She never remembers that part.

401
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,635
Family is important to her.

402
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,453
I care about family.

403
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:09,190
You know, don had nobody at their wedding.

404
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:11,025
Nobody at all.

405
00:25:14,462 --> 00:25:16,630
Why can't we just move in with him?

406
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:18,666
I'll take care of him.

407
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,667
It's bad enough to work for him.

408
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,053
I'm a
30-year-old man.

409
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,773
I don't want to have somebody
tell me I have the wrong tie on.

410
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:44,385
Raffit is sending over every piece
of paper they have on the new garden.

411
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:46,687
He wants you to see these new drawings.

412
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:48,656
Apparently they're right out of "metropolis."

413
00:26:48,723 --> 00:26:51,358
- Did he talk about television?
- I have a meeting on the books.

414
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:54,328
He talked a lot about radio... And kinsey.

415
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,829
You're gonna have to keep
a low profile on this,

416
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,297
But it doesn't mean you're not working.

417
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,066
<i>Mr. Pryce is here to see you.</i>

418
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:05,489
Oh, I didn't realize you were
in the middle of something.

419
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:07,791
Did you come to treat us to
a little new-business lunch?

420
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,044
May I speak with you in private, don?

421
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,937
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

422
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,707
Bad news, I'm afraid.

423
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,576
I just got off the phone with london.

424
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,379
There's a problem with madison square garden.

425
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,464
Did their check bounce already?

426
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:32,483
Unfortunately, there's a conflict.

427
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,486
Did you tell them it's a stadium
in the middle of new york city?

428
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,938
- It's one of a kind. - They
know exactly what it is--

429
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,324
A project-- and they
told us to turn it down.

430
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,712
- I'm confused
- It's a question of economics.

431
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:49,316
Servicing madison square garden
will require an account man,

432
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:53,153
At least two copywriters, two
artists, an ombudsman to city hall--

433
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,673
All against 200,000 in billings.

434
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,258
- That's for right now.
- Precisely.

435
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,678
From what I understand,
groundbreaking is two years away.

436
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,647
Madison square garden is our
way into the world's fair,

437
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:05,599
The largest trade show in history.

438
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:07,818
<i>Plus there's the
garden itself--</i>

439
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:12,456
Hotels, concerts, sports. This
could mean 30 years of business.

440
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,343
They're not interested. I'm sorry.

441
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,481
You told me to go out and get this account.

442
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:22,232
I did. I did my job.

443
00:28:22,317 --> 00:28:23,734
And now you're telling
me it's all for nothing

444
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:25,719
because you forgot to
check with your boss first?

445
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,104
Who's running this place?

446
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:31,058
I know this is difficult.
I take full responsibility.

447
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:33,026
Why the hell did you buy
us in the first place?

448
00:28:35,663 --> 00:28:37,364
I don't know.

449
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,246
Tell mr. Campbell madison
square garden is dead.

450
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,181
Do you have a second?

451
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:56,417
- Can it wait?
- No.

452
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:04,258
Sal sent up the storyboards.

453
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:06,927
What is this?

454
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,062
It's patio, the diet drink for pepsi.

455
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,999
Yes. Everyone wants a drink
that sounds like a floor.

456
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,552
- This is chinese.
- It's all one shot,

457
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:17,421
Like the beginning of "bye bye birdie."

458
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,224
- I haven't seen it.
- Well, this is an Ann Margret type.

459
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:21,809
Fine.

460
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:26,046
You really haven't seen
it? You see everything.

461
00:29:47,668 --> 00:29:49,903
We have a few versions of a song,

462
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:52,772
And the boys are very excited
about finding this girl.

463
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,774
I'm sure.

464
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,127
Don't you find her voice shrill?

465
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,248
Just throw yourself at the camera.

466
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:03,317
It's pure.

467
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:05,769
It makes your heart hurt.

468
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,855
No one seems to care that it speaks to men,

469
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,624
Not the people that drink diet drinks.

470
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:13,961
What do the geniuses at patio want?

471
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:19,950
Maybe we should be talking about how
this is better than coffee or dexedrine.

472
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:22,119
It's not about making women feel fat.

473
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:27,257
This is "look how happy
I am that I drink patio.

474
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:29,927
I'm young, excited and desperate for a man."

475
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:34,781
I don't mind fantasies, but
shouldn't it be a female one?

476
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:36,783
Peggy, I know you understand how this works.

477
00:30:36,817 --> 00:30:38,919
Men want her. Women want to be her.

478
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:41,338
- Even if that's
true-- - it is.

479
00:30:42,724 --> 00:30:44,892
I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.

480
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:49,196
Well, you know if we were
making a movie or a play,

481
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,064
We'd be embarrassed to do this.  It's phony.

482
00:30:53,668 --> 00:30:56,503
You're not an artist,
peggy. You solve problems.

483
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:01,642
Leave some tools in your toolbox.

484
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:09,917
<i>Could you hold that?</i>

485
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:23,664
- Heading home?
- Yes.

486
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,921
Let me ask you something.
You're a young girl.

487
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:34,057
- Excuse me?
- You're the only one around here

488
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,943
Who doesn't have that
stupid look on her face.

489
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,363
What does that mean?

490
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:41,381
What would your father have to do

491
00:31:41,415 --> 00:31:44,301
For you to not want him at your wedding?

492
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:46,637
My father passed away.

493
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:49,873
There you go. You'd do anything.

494
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,266
Hello.

495
00:32:49,083 --> 00:32:51,418
It's so crowded in here. I
feel like I'm on the subway.

496
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,890
Where's your drink?

497
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:14,607
Don.  Don't worry about this.

498
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,126
It's under control.

499
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,373
Hey, where's mom?

500
00:33:29,457 --> 00:33:31,091
She's upstairs.

501
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:46,907
- I'm going out for a bucket of chicken.
- What's the matter?

502
00:33:48,543 --> 00:33:51,928
- I'm a horrible daughter.
- No, you're not.

503
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:53,847
William says these are the options:

504
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:55,866
We put him in a home

505
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,535
Or they move in with him
and judy is his nurse.

506
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,021
- Judy.
- William says?

507
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:04,841
He's probably right.

508
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:07,677
- William!
- Yeah, Don?

509
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,980
I'll go get the chicken in a minute.

510
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:15,669
Can I speak to you a minute?

511
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,399
Jesus.  What year is this from?

512
00:34:30,752 --> 00:34:32,686
I don't care.

513
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,555
Look, don,

514
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,974
We're all upset.

515
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:39,726
One thing I've
learned from this--

516
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,561
Don't get old.

517
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,331
- About your father.
- It's a real jackpot.

518
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:47,200
He always said he didn't want to be a burden,

519
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,636
And yet here we are.

520
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,139
This is what's going to happen.

521
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,610
You're going to explain to
your sister and your wife

522
00:34:56,644 --> 00:34:58,745
That we have reached an understanding.

523
00:34:58,779 --> 00:35:02,766
You are going to support
your father financially

524
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,602
And I am going to take him into my house.

525
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,388
His house will remain untouched.

526
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,557
I appreciate the advice, don.

527
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,659
I'll take it under consideration.

528
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,961
You're gonna go out there and
you're gonna tell your sister

529
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:17,214
That this is what you want.

530
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:19,633
We'll pretend that you did
the right thing on your own.

531
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,935
- He's my father!
- And he's in my home.

532
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,790
I want you to leave tonight and
I want you to leave the lincoln.

533
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,209
- I can't have him here without a car.
- Are you kidding me?

534
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,547
How are we supposed to get home?

535
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,384
New york
central--

536
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:39,419
Broadway limited from penn station.

537
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,354
It leaves in two hours.

538
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:47,327
You want him? You got him.

539
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,979
<i>You're it!</i>

540
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:28,118
We'll leave dad's house as is,

541
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:30,904
And I think it'd be a good idea...

542
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,098
Dad, we have to talk.

543
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:44,751
- I could eat.
- No.

544
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:47,137
Daddy, william has something to say.

545
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:52,525
All of us-- we've been
trying to figure out a way

546
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:54,194
We can help you live better.

547
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:56,696
I'd be doing all right
if people left me alone.

548
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,666
Daddy...

549
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,501
Don and I want you to live here with us.

550
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:04,854
Elizabeth.

551
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:06,973
Honey, I'm not that blue.

552
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,142
Just for a while.

553
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:10,977
I think you need a little vacation.

554
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:18,068
So the animals are running the zoo?

555
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,954
We're not selling the house,
and you're gonna have your car.

556
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,593
The plans, the plans, the plans you make.

557
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:34,401
You know you want to get out of town.

558
00:37:34,468 --> 00:37:37,070
You'll be with the kids.

559
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:40,407
Betty is a better cook. You always say that.

560
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:48,081
Well, I should've been the first to go.

561
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,618
Daddy, don't talk like that.

562
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,356
We should go pack.

563
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,825
Girls, start getting your things together.

564
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:09,686
<i>It's nice, right?</i>

565
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,688
It's called a stinger.

566
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:14,774
- I don't know what's in it.
- It's delicious.

567
00:38:20,448 --> 00:38:22,866
I'm graduating from
brooklyn college next month.

568
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,784
What are you studying?

569
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:27,837
- What?
- What are you studying?

570
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:30,140
Do you want one?

571
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,309
I'm afraid you're gonna bite my hand.

572
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,293
I'm sorry.

573
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,396
I just need to eat.

574
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,733
My mom says I'm still growing.

575
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,404
I've got to work on my manners.

576
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,258
I started pre-law, but
switched to engineering--

577
00:38:48,342 --> 00:38:51,077
- More jobs.
- Really?

578
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,431
- Those are so different.
- You've gotta figure--

579
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:56,216
If we're all gonna be replaced by machines,

580
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,901
Might as well be a guy
that makes them, right?

581
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:00,887
Or you could just become a robot.

582
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:03,189
Are you in school?

583
00:39:03,223 --> 00:39:05,442
I work at an ad agency,

584
00:39:05,526 --> 00:39:07,693
- Manhattan.
- Wow.

585
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,913
I don't know how you
girls do all that typing.

586
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:14,834
And I work for a jerk.

587
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:17,003
We're hitting the road. You got cab fare?

588
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,689
What are you talking about?
I live around the corner.

589
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,891
Oh, that's right. He does.

590
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:36,756
You're funny.

591
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,634
Do you have, you know...

592
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,938
- What?
- ...A trojan?

593
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:12,625
Oh.

594
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,244
Oh.  No.

595
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,793
I can't.

596
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:33,396
I can't.

597
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,407
Jeez.

598
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:47,210
It's getting pretty late.

599
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,514
Well...

600
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,050
There are other things we could do.

601
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,582
Did you hear that?

602
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,061
Gene.

603
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,065
The heat is on. We've
gotta get rid of this stuff.

604
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,106
You got anything else around, go flush it.

605
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,239
- You're leaving?
- I have to work tomorrow.

606
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,507
You want to get breakfast?

607
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:43,660
It's the middle of the night.

608
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,698
- Where do you work again?
- Madison avenue.

609
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:50,133
Oh yeah.

610
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:56,005
Well, you know, I hang
out at that place a lot.

611
00:42:58,592 --> 00:43:01,678
Oh.  Okay.

612
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:14,691
It's the bottom one.

613
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:18,695
Thanks.

614
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:22,498
This was fun.

615
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,293
Parents, friends and family,

616
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,261
I'd like to welcome you all to field day.

617
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,964
I hope you can appreciate

618
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,183
How hard the children have prepared

619
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,521
Scott?

620
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:55,898
The tradition of the maypole dates back over
500 years and is celebrated all over the world.

621
00:43:55,932 --> 00:44:02,188
<i>We erected our maypole for
ossining's sesquicentennial.</i>

622
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:07,910
We dance around the pole in a timeless
celebration of the renewal of springtime."

623
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,788
<i>Okay, ribbons up.</i>

624
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:33,079
Daddy! Did you see me dance?

625
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,664
I did. You were great.

626
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:38,835
<i>Hey, drapers.</i>

627
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,090
Cindy's dad wants to take our picture.

628
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,909
Okay, say "cheese!"

629
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,846
<i>Cheese!</i>

630
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:09,532
- How was your morning, mr. Draper?
- Fine.

631
