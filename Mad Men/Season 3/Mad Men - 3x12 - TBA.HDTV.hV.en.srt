1
00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:01,897
Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:03,577
I wanted you to come to me.

3
00:00:03,612 --> 00:00:05,737
- And why is that?
- Because you're married.

4
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:08,341
- So you're missing here?
- Are you asking if I miss you?

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,750
- What's your name?
- It used to be Dick Whitman.

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,457
I didn't want to go to her wedding,
but I did.

7
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:16,009
The least you can do
is not come to mine.

8
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:17,824
You're not even giving Jane a chance.

9
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,382
I wanna take you in that bedroom,

10
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:21,457
And give you a go round
like you never had.

11
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:25,126
I wanted to inform you that 
you're now the head of accounts.

12
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:26,152
Excuse me?

13
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:28,115
We're making you head of accounts.

14
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:29,803
Spectacular.

15
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:36,420


16
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:41,518


17
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:11,433
Mr. Campbell.

18
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:13,584
Mr. Campbell.

19
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:16,518
I've got your hot cocoa.

20
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:21,892
Wonderful.

21
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:25,039
I just got back from lunch,
and Mr. Pryce wants to see you.

22
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:30,012
- It's instant.
- It's from the diner.

23
00:01:30,188 --> 00:01:31,514
I don't know how you can tell.

24
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:34,727
You can tell because they use
water instead of milk.

25
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:39,341
It's warmer outside.
It's ridiculous.

26
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:43,083
The building will take care of it.
They always do.

27
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:46,204
Sorry about that.

28
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:48,918
This really is hitting the spot.

29
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:57,547
Come in.

30
00:02:00,873 --> 00:02:02,646
Have a seat.

31
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:09,526
I believe I have what is
rather disappointing news.

32
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:13,707
It's been decided that Mr. Cosgrove 
will be made Senior vice president

33
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:18,950
In charge of account services and 
you will
be made head of account management.

34
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:22,307
Really?

35
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,320
This is not to 
ignore that you've

36
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,793
Distinguished yourself and been 
of great service to the company.

37
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,060
What is it based on?

38
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:32,149
Our billings are neck and neck.

39
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:34,380
In fact, i think I've done a lot

40
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,497
With what i was given
in this arbitrary scheme.

41
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:43,054
It's become apparent that you are
excellent at making the clients feel 

42
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:47,781
Their needs are being met,
but mr. Cosgrove has the rare gift

43
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:51,022
Of making them feel as 
if they haven't any needs.

44
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:56,277
- I see.
- I improved your title.

45
00:02:56,944 --> 00:03:00,817
And you tell your clients there'll 
be no need to be deprecating.

46
00:03:00,885 --> 00:03:04,561
- Bert and Toger know about this?
- This is under my authority.

47
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:08,463
And i have to commend you
on taking it as well as you have.

48
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:19,238
I hope this was
a difficult decision.

49
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:20,868
It was.

50
00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:36,154
There you go.

51
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:50,885
- Where are you going?
- I don't feel well.

52
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:56,521
Why did you pick that place?
I don't know why a lunch counter is

53
00:03:56,522 --> 00:04:00,224
- any better than eating at your desk.
- Well, you could've joined me for a drink.

54
00:04:00,337 --> 00:04:03,192
I can drink at my desk if i 
want to, and i'm not out $1.25.

55
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:07,525
I'm sorry I'm not asstimulating
a lunch companion as doug,

56
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:10,732
It's duck, and i work most lunches.

57
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,473
Well, i don't like his aftershave.

58
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:15,720
I can smell it on you and i can smell
it in the bathroom in the morning.

59
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,383
What's wrong with him?

60
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,458
Nothing. I don't even know why i'm
weighing in on men right now.

61
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:24,513
I think it's good that
you're being picky, finally.

62
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:29,588
Well, there's nothing around but married ones, I
mean, we can't all throw caution to the wind.

63
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,849
Duck's not married.

64
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,565
Oh. Then why are you with him=

65
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:41,197
Well, this is me.

66
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,503
- Are you working late tonight?
- I don't know yet.

67
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,231
Bye.

68
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,000
Wow. Van Cleef.

69
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:52,431
How very Janie Siegel-Sterling.

70
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:55,777
They're blue and they're new.

71
00:04:55,998 --> 00:04:59,981
- She's trying.
- You always take her side.

72
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:06,732
- I do not.
- She started giving me advice--

73
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:11,065
"Don't go to bed angry.
Let them do what they want.

74
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:13,072
Dress sexy"--

75
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:15,872
And all i kept thinking 
about was daddy.

76
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:20,294
It's disgusting doesn't 
she know that?

77
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:22,660
That she ruined my life?

78
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:26,323
Your father had a part in it.

79
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:29,783
You don't think I know that?

80
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:33,424
Brooks is different 
than your father.

81
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:36,215
I don't want to get married.

82
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:42,694
Everything's pointing to the fact that 
I Shouldn't and everybody knows.

83
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:45,818
Brooks knows.
His mother knows.

84
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,536
Do you know what she said to me?

85
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:55,175
She said in India if the wedding
doesn't take place at the appointed hour,

86
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:58,559
- They burn the bride.
- Just because she went to India,

87
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,673
Doesn't mean she's not an idiot.

88
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:02,261
And jane--

89
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,338
If she's coming,

90
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,119
I'm not going.

91
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,380
She's coming because your father's
coming and he paid for everything.

92
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,533
You're having the wedding.

93
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:15,624
The bride will not be burned.

94
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,110
Turn those earrings into
a tea service or something.

95
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,831
- Aren't you listening to me?
- I am and you're babbling like a little fool.

96
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:23,328
- Go to your room.
- What?

97
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:26,883
You heard me. You want to act like
a child I'll treat you like one.

98
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:35,223
Would somebody get that?

99
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:44,890
- Hello.
- Daddy.

100
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:47,259
Are you alone?

101
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,786
- Yes, what's wrong?
- Nothing's right.

102
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:53,755
My bridesmaids are supposed to give me
something blue and something new--

103
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:56,210
Or mommy. She should know that.

104
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:57,474
Who?

105
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,671
I don't like her, daddy, and i've told
you I don't want her to be there.

106
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:05,394
- Honey, put your mother on the phone.
- He wants to talk to you.

107
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:14,512
You have to keep Jane under control.

108
00:07:14,513 --> 00:07:16,945
Well, first of all, tell the 
bride that everything is copacetic.

109
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:20,030
We both agree that she's 
nuts and she should shut up.

110
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:23,555
Your father said that he's sorry,
that Jane will stay

111
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:25,729
Out of your way And that 
we're both tired of the drama.

112
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,961
- He said all that?
- I'm not playing chicken anymore.

113
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:31,436
If she wants to cancel the wedding,
I'll take the deposit out of her inheritance.

114
00:07:31,607 --> 00:07:33,500
He said the wedding's off.

115
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:37,302
- Fine.
- You mean that? You're not 
worried about India?

116
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:41,077
- Why are you doing this?
- Do you want to cancel it or not?

117
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,713
No.

118
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,063
Then go eat something.
I'm not taking that dress in again.

119
00:07:54,148 --> 00:07:57,657
Why did Jane get her
such an expensive gift?

120
00:07:57,955 --> 00:07:59,687
I didn't even know they saw each other.

121
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,844
Of course you didn't.

122
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:04,744
- I forbid it.
- I can't wait to get her out of here.

123
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,545
Is everything okay?

124
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:09,067
Goodbye.

125
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:12,275
Yeah, goodbye.

126
00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:14,912
Jane!

127
00:08:14,913 --> 00:08:16,559
Get in here now.

128
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,465
I didn't know you were home.

129
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:22,650
You were home. I overdid it at lunch,
as did you, i heard.

130
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:26,164
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I just wanted to make amends.

131
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:29,185
- I got her a beautiful present.
- Why the hell are you even talking to her?

132
00:08:29,186 --> 00:08:31,216
You're screwing things up!

133
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:33,472
I'm tired of the awkwardness

134
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:35,761
And i'm trying to be nice.

135
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:41,167
I don't know what kind of world you live
in, but i am the good person here.

136
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:44,899
You're not good because you didn't
listen to me and you really upset her.

137
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:53,399
Everything you do is for her.

138
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:58,374
I'm your wife. And guess what--
I live here and i get to do what i want to do,

139
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,887
So stop trying to tell me
that you know better.

140
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:07,611
You'd better not have
locked that door.

141
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:09,242
Go away!

142
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:11,802
Or what? You'll commit suicide?

143
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,852
Peter, what are you doing home?

144
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,278
I got fired.

145
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,993
What happened?

146
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:35,343
Lane told me Kenny
is senior something

147
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:37,950
Of something accounts and i'm not.

148
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,405
I'm account something.

149
00:09:41,806 --> 00:09:43,597
I couldn't even hear him.

150
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:47,248
All i saw was his
froglike mouth flapping.

151
00:09:47,612 --> 00:09:51,194
- So did he ask you to leave?
- No.

152
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:57,027
I have to ask this, but 
did you lose your temper?

153
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,368
No, i didn't.

154
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,745
That's good.

155
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,728
That's verygood.

156
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:08,046
Do you remember if he said anything
about how much they want you to stay?

157
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,932
- No.
- That's good too. So it didn't come up.

158
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:16,167
Trudy, stop it with 
the ellery queen.

159
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:20,988
I'm going to call Duck.

160
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:25,181
No, you're not. They would have 
fired you if they wanted to fire you.

161
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:27,823
You need to wait and see how it goes.

162
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:32,408
He basically said I care too much
about my clients and they notice it.

163
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,386
How could that be bad?

164
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:40,851
Peter, you hold all the cards.

165
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,587
It's going to be fine.

166
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:10,013
I thought you had left.

167
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,533
I'm here.

168
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,418
I see.

169
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,551
Well, thank you.

170
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:20,676
I've done it before.

171
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,372
Go back to bed.

172
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:35,414
Do you want anything?

173
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:37,545
No. I'll be in in a bit.

174
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:47,271
Oh, it's got to be 100 in here.

175
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,344
You ask the building 
for heat, you get heat.

176
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,065
Mr. Herman on line one.

177
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:58,221
Hello. Can you give me a minute?

178
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,216
No.

179
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,371
I'm right around the corner
at the elysee, room 531.

180
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:05,464
I'm in the middle of something.

181
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:08,153
Peewee sweetheart, it's been three weeks.

182
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:10,174
You can get room service.

183
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,922
I think they have a Monte
Cristo sandwich. You love that.

184
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,430
I'm having lunch with Kurt and Smitty.

185
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,944
They're a couple of homos.
Tell them you have plans.

186
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,306
It's kind of short notice.

187
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,438
Come on, creative, be creative.

188
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:38,681
I have to go to the printer.
I know a nooner when I hear one.

189
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,195
You're disgusting.

190
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:43,125
No, Bob did.

191
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:45,068
Bob?

192
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,397
I was hoping to catch you on your way to lunch.

193
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:48,796
Too late.

194
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:55,002
I must say I'm surprised.

195
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:58,395
Frankly, I was a little suspicious... I found out yesterday
that  head of accounts is going to Kenny and his haircut.

196
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,279
I heard.

197
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:02,486
Can you turn that off?

198
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,383
Not really.

199
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:13,829
Did you ask him why he invited her?

200
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:15,586
He said something about not wanting her
to actually have to get involved.

201
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:21,437
What does it mean?
It's not good.

202
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:24,164
I know it's not good.

203
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:27,067
There's no future for me her

204
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:29,982
How did you do it?

205
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,621
You made your job u

206
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:33,191
I didn't. I looked at other agencies,

207
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,795
saw that they had Tv departments

208
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,996
and wondered why we didn't.

209
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:38,860
Oh. There's no such thing in the accounts field.

210
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:40,667
There's marketing.

211
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:42,501
That's a research job.

212
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:46,272
Is this official?

213
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:47,481
Yes.

214
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:49,639
I'm afraid we can't hire Mr. Charcot.

215
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,993
Well, at least you had the guts
to send me a memo.

216
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:54,604
He's far too expensive.

217
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:56,422
Salvatore Romano is gone.

218
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:58,595
There is no one in charge
of the art department.

219
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:00,697
I haven't heard a complaint
from any of the clients.

220
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,428
Jesus! It's hotter in here than in my office.

221
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:05,585
That's because you're overexcited.

222
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:08,014
Do you want me to walk you
through a delivery schedule?

223
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:14,725
This is Walter Cronkite in our newsroom

224
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:18,637
and there has been an attempt,
as perhaps you know now,

225
00:14:18,672 --> 00:14:20,291
on the life of President Kennedy.

226
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,673
He was wounded in an automobile
driving from Dallas airport

227
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,317
into downtown Dallas along with
governor Connally of Texas.

228
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:30,092
They've been taken to Parkland
Hospital there where their condition

229
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:31,921
is as yet unkn...

230
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,686
My God, how much have
you been smoking in here?

231
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:42,623
Sorry about that.

232
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,306
I'm, uh, glad you ran over.

233
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:52,998
Me too.

234
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:56,233
I don't understand.

235
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:58,690
I can't run my department
without an art director.

236
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,244
Do you want to call Saint John?

237
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:03,102
Bert Cooper still has a say around here.

238
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:14,345
Hello. What?

239
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,693
If they wanted to fire you,
they would've fired you.

240
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,509
I'm gonna die at this desk, unnoticed.

241
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,405
Do you have any idea what
I've done for this company?

242
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,269
- What are you doing??
- They shot the president.

243
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:26,487
What?

244
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:31,464
... top of the President's car
was down they drew their pistols,

245
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,754
but the damage was done. The
President was slumped over

246
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:36,250
in the back seat of the car, face down.

247
00:15:36,638 --> 00:15:39,478
Then Governor Connally, after
slumping to the left for a moment,

248
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:41,936
lay on the floor of the rear seats.

249
00:15:41,971 --> 00:15:43,097
Oh my God.

250
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:44,508
- Dear God.
- Is he dead?

251
00:15:57,574 --> 00:15:59,282
What the hell is going on?

252
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,728
Every person listening at this
moment has flashed back

253
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:14,537
to that day in April, 1945,
when Franklin Delano Roosevelt...

254
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:17,454
Excuse me, Chet, here is a flash
from the Associated Press,

255
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:18,526
Dateline Dallas.

256
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,695
Two priests who were with
President Kennedy say he is dead

257
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:23,283
of bullet wounds.

258
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,892
There is no further confirmation,
but this is what we have...

259
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:28,812
Is he okay?

260
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,225
They just said he died.

261
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:33,924
Two priests in Dallas who were
with President Kennedy

262
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,582
say he is dead of bullet wounds.

263
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:37,170
- Oh, lord.
- There is no further confirmation.

264
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,901
This is the only word we have
indicating the President may,

265
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:42,422
in fact, have lost his life.

266
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:45,515
It has just moved on the Associated
Press wires from Dallas.

267
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,634
The two priests were called to the
hospital to administer the last rites...

268
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:52,100
- Oh my goodness.
- I know.

269
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:55,122
And it is from them we get the word
that the President has died,

270
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:58,571
that the bullet wounds 
inflicted on him as he rode 

271
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:00,896
in a motorcade through downtown
Dallas have been fatal.

272
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:03,828
We would remind you there is no official confirmation of this from

273
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:05,767
any source as yet.

274
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,392
Bill, just moments before
you brought the flash, I had

275
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,409
word from the hospital

276
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:12,894
that the vice President, Lyndon Johnson,
and his wife had just left the hospital,

277
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:14,547
been rushed away into a motor...

278
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:17,384
Did you give me a hickey?

279
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:20,803
- I don't think so.
- I told you I don't like that.

280
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,595
I get questions from my mother.

281
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:30,117
Listen. There was a news story that
was on right before you came in.

282
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:33,165
It's been distracting me.

283
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:36,291
You didn't seem distracted.

284
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:40,425
I just want to see what's going on.

285
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,546
What's going on?

286
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:50,196
... It was only on October the
24th that our ambassador

287
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,205
to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson,

288
00:17:52,422 --> 00:17:56,389
was assaulted in Dallas leaving
a dinner meeting there.

289
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,595
From Dallas, Texas, the
flash, apparently official:

290
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:07,897
President Kennedy died at
1:00 p.m. Central standard time,

291
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,073
2:00 eastern...

292
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:11,759
- Jesus.
- Oh my God.

293
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,606
What happened

294
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:22,394
Vice President Lyndon Johnson has
left the hospital in Dallas.

295
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:24,305
I've gotta call my kids.

296
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,182
We do not know to where he has proceed.

297
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:29,055
Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly

298
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:33,833
and become the 36th President of the United...

299
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,399
President Johnson is under heavy guard...

300
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,252
it's ruined.

301
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:43,426
It's over.

302
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:47,647
It's gonna be ruined.

303
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:53,435
Five-year- old boy and myself were by
ourselves on the grass there on Palmer Street.

304
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:55,716
and I asked Joe to wave to him.

305
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:57,287
Betts?

306
00:19:08,991 --> 00:19:10,504
Where's your mother?

307
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:12,018
She's not feeling well.

308
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:21,140
I can't stop crying.

309
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,298
Why are the kids watching this?

310
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:34,325
What am I supposed to do, Don?

311
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,755
Am I supposed to keep it from them?

312
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,206
Take a pill and lie down.

313
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,751
I can handle the kids.

314
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:56,071
Turn this off. I'll make us some dinner.

315
00:19:56,886 --> 00:20:00,104

by another witness,

00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:02,203
Mary Norman of Dallas, showing the
President slumped over in the car.

317
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:06,722
Just as Mary started to take
the picture, the President came

318
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:08,694
right even with us, two shots...

319
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:10,671
You two, look at me.

320
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:14,575
Two shots rang out and he grabbed his chest.

321
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,395
Everything is going to be okay.

322
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:22,917
We have a new President and we're
all gonna be sad for a little bit.

323
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:26,789
And then on Monday there's gonna be a funeral.

324
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:29,474
Are we going to the funeral?

325
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,447
... shots rang out, but by that time
the motorcade had sped away.

326
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:19,106
... Fair play for Cuba,

327
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:22,353
a pro-Castro organization,
where he had been arrested

328
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:26,100
on disturbance of the peace charges.

329
00:21:26,135 --> 00:21:27,629
He denied he was a communist,

330
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:29,713
said he was a Marxist and claimed there was quite a difference

331
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:33,928
between the two. Police in Dallas 
have just announced...

332
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:36,271
you should get ready. It's almost 2:00.

333
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:39,081
Really, Don?

334
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,524
... Gunpowder traces on both hands,

335
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,797
indicating he'd recently used a rifle...

336
00:21:43,832 --> 00:21:46,036
the type of weapon that killed
Mr. Kennedy yesterday.

337
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:48,943
As we told you a short time ago,
Oswald has refused...

338
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,080
He's 24 years old.

339
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:56,127
In Washington, the body
of the late President

340
00:21:56,162 --> 00:21:58,671
lies in the east room of the White House...

341
00:21:58,706 --> 00:22:00,093
Come on, Betts.

342
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,787
Are you sure they haven't canceled it?

343
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,587
It said in "The Times" 
they were doing that.

344
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:07,234
I'm not gonna call Roger to find out.

345
00:22:08,686 --> 00:22:11,781
If we go in and it's off,
we'll grab dinner or something.

346
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,596
I can't sit in front of the tv all day.

347
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,530
Fine.

348
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,176
Just stay here until Carla comes.

349
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,381
After the terrible news had reached us...

350
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,549
Can you see bags?

351
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:40,060
I don't understand this.

352
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,908
And here we are...

353
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:44,957
Lyndon Johnson, more of the same.

354
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,924
Nobody voted for him.

355
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:49,978
It felt for a second like everything
was about to change.

356
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:52,759
You should get your coat and your scarf.

357
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:55,048
I know it's far, but I
really feel like walking.

358
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:57,985
Why are we going?

359
00:22:58,247 --> 00:23:00,821
Because it's your boss's daughter's wedding.

360
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:03,396
It's business, Pete, and there
a system. You always say that.

361
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:07,642
It's one thing to go to this wedding
and act like I don't hate them.

362
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:11,484
It's another thing to go and act
like the President hasn't been murdered.

363
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:15,172
Maybe they'll cancel it,
but we have to show.

364
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:29,185
- Have you been drinking?
- The whole country's drinking,

365
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:33,675
and not to celebrate some
spoiled brat's wedding.

366
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:37,314
We are mourning together with his widow...

367
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,887
They'll never cancel.

368
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:40,576
You know why?

369
00:23:42,176 --> 00:23:43,800
Because they're happy.

370
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,562
You should've heard some of
the things people said yesterday.

371
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,601
Like what? What did they say?

372
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:54,125
"The man made a lot of enemies," things like that.

373
00:23:54,593 --> 00:23:56,143
That's awful.

374
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:59,495
I don't care what your politics
are, this is America.

375
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,680
You don't just shoot the President.

376
00:24:04,613 --> 00:24:07,308
Chet Huntley was talking about
Jackie and those kids,

377
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:10,417
how she just lost that baby, and Harry Crane was

378
00:24:10,452 --> 00:24:16,062
looking at his paperwork, calculating how many
commercials weren't going to be aired.

379
00:24:18,513 --> 00:24:20,056
I'm not going.

380
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:23,551
You can go and say I'm sick
if you think it's that important.

381
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:27,509
"... Demonstrates the internal threat
that can never be underestimated."

382
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:29,244
No, you're right.

383
00:24:29,304 --> 00:24:31,082
"Our sympathy for the Kennedy family

384
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:34,036
is no less that it is for the millions
of people who have sustained 

385
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:36,561
equal losses in the fight for freedom."

386
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:46,658
I got a call from Leona, this girl I used
to work with at the phone company.

387
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:48,777
My friend Francine called me.

388
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:50,364
Don couldn't get through.

389
00:24:50,677 --> 00:24:52,634
The system was completely overloaded.

390
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,012
It's annoying that people think the
operators were watching tv.

391
00:24:56,047 --> 00:24:57,763
They were as frustrated as anyone.

392
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,216
The maitre d' has reorganized the seating.

393
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,659
If you are at an even-numbered
table, take these first six.

394
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:08,273
If you are at an odd-numbered table,
the left side of the room.

395
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,601
Maestro, do you mind?

396
00:25:10,905 --> 00:25:11,782
Thank you.

397
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:15,001
Look, everybody, grab your plate
and come on up to the front here,

398
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:17,229
sit wherever you feel like.

399
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:21,582
And please feel free to have the
prime rib and the fillet of sole.

400
00:25:21,617 --> 00:25:22,718
Help yourself.

401
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:25,347
I mean that. There are no waiters.

402
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:31,256
Three months after Roosevelt
died, we bombed Hiroshima.

403
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,970
That's how we got over it.

404
00:25:33,358 --> 00:25:36,557
I say we hang Lee Oswald and
then we take care of Texas...

405
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:38,509
Hell, the whole south.

406
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:42,727
What did everyone think of the sweetbreads?

407
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:46,510
You were right, mommy. Okay?

408
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:51,425
Problem solved.

409
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:52,609
Hardly.

410
00:25:52,644 --> 00:25:54,764
They just told me the cake's not coming.

411
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,156
Shit.

412
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:30,157
I have to say on some level Harry has a point.

413
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:31,956
I think he wanted attention.

414
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:34,050
He obviously didn't fit in.

415
00:26:34,568 --> 00:26:36,293
Congratulations.

416
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:38,613
You are so beautiful, like Natalie Wood or something.

417
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,771
Daddy, I really wish you could've
gotten to see the ceremony.

418
00:26:44,158 --> 00:26:45,619
It's okay. We understand.

419
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:47,164
We're honored you're here.

420
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,756
I heard the church was packed.

421
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,272
Those weren't our guests.

422
00:26:51,614 --> 00:26:52,564
Have a seat.

423
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,212
Just sit anywhere.

424
00:26:57,848 --> 00:26:59,411
I'm so happy for you.

425
00:27:05,843 --> 00:27:08,851
I would like some legal representation,
but these police officers

426
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:11,143
have not allowed me to have any.

427
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,183
I don't know what this is all about.

428
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:16,269
- Did you kill the President?
- No, sir, I didn't.

429
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:18,053
People keep asking me that.

430
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:21,450
How would you know that's
what a monster looks like?

431
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:24,742
Naturally, if I work in that building, yes, sir.

432
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,035
Did you see "The Times"?

433
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,294
He lived in Russia.

434
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,618
I thought he just visited.

435
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:30,255
Would you visit?

436
00:27:31,252 --> 00:27:32,825
I'm just a patsy.

437
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:37,787
There you are. What are you doing here?

438
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:39,703
They're about to interview Oswald.

439
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:41,894
Hey, somebody go buy a cake.

440
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,883
Has the gentleman been identified?

441
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,248
I need you out there. I'm about to give my toast.

442
00:27:51,777 --> 00:27:53,993
I've heard your toast a million times.

443
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,853
The President is dead.

444
00:27:55,888 --> 00:27:58,517
And I'll tell you... something else...
our table has no one at it.

445
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,600
I consolidated the tables.

446
00:28:01,752 --> 00:28:03,173
Would you keep an eye on her?

447
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,029
Absolutely.

448
00:28:10,894 --> 00:28:12,405
We'd better get back in there.

449
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,082
Jane.

450
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,271
That this investigation has
been carried on jointly...

451
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:23,793
This toast is going to be much
shorter than it was supposed to be.

452
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:26,628
Obviously, we're all in a different mood.

453
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:30,451
Can someone please get my
wife out of the kitchen?

454
00:28:30,486 --> 00:28:32,514
I have something very nice
to say about her.

455
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:34,760
But while we're alone...

456
00:28:36,723 --> 00:28:39,051
...I want to say something
nice about my ex-wife.

457
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:43,086
Mona, you're a lioness.

458
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:46,978
And thank you for resisting
the urge to eat your cub.

459
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:53,609
This could've been an awful
day, but here we are...

460
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:58,023
Not watching tv but, together,
watching the two of you.

461
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:02,213
To Margaret and Brooks Hargrove.

462
00:29:06,646 --> 00:29:10,261
The adults... we all wanted to be
strong for you, but your spirit

463
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:13,576
your love, your hope is giving us strength.

464
00:29:14,864 --> 00:29:15,957
And I promise you now... 

465
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:18,103
if you can make it
through a day like today,

466
00:29:18,138 --> 00:29:20,199
marriage is a cakewalk.

467
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:22,702
To many years of happiness.

468
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:24,020
Cheers.

469
00:29:26,782 --> 00:29:29,999
We invite the father of the bride and
the bride to share the dance floor.

470
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,883
Sorry about that.

471
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:39,236
Now if there are any other
fathers and daughters... 

472
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:42,779
You know what? Everyone, please, join them.

473
00:29:49,516 --> 00:29:50,623
Do you want to dance?

474
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,058
I don't know.

475
00:30:06,422 --> 00:30:08,236
Want me to teach him how to dance?

476
00:30:08,922 --> 00:30:10,767
He's a great dancer.

477
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:16,905
She's happy.

478
00:30:18,002 --> 00:30:20,590
That's because she doesn't know his
net worth just dropped by half.

479
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:23,388
Stop it, daddy.

480
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:40,577
Everything's gonna be fine.

481
00:30:42,978 --> 00:30:44,707
How do you know that?

482
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,953
You'll see.

483
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,009
Why do you keep
looking at that woman?

484
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,847
What are you talking about?

485
00:31:50,286 --> 00:31:51,316
- are you ready?

486
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:53,990
- did jennifer fall in?
- she'll be right out.

487
00:31:54,909 --> 00:31:56,262
- see you tuesday.

488
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,646
He was so handsome, and now i'll never get
to vote for him.

489
00:32:36,418 --> 00:32:38,497
You want me to cut you out
of that dress?

490
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,091
I'm making a phone call.

491
00:33:01,223 --> 00:33:02,244
- hello.

492
00:33:03,312 --> 00:33:04,638
- so what's new?

493
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,382
It's incredible, isn't it?

494
00:33:08,974 --> 00:33:10,289
Yes.

495
00:33:11,143 --> 00:33:12,954
Margaret got married today.

496
00:33:13,273 --> 00:33:15,487
That's right. I forgot.

497
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:17,220
Poor thing.

498
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,898
Joanie, i wish you could've seen it.

499
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:23,058
Oh my god, what a disaster.

500
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:26,327
I'm sorry.
Yeah, she pulled through.

501
00:33:26,362 --> 00:33:27,477
They pulled through.

502
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:28,993
I pulled through.

503
00:33:33,522 --> 00:33:35,526
I can't believe how 
quiet it is out there.

504
00:33:35,561 --> 00:33:37,126
Not everywhere.

505
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,689
Greg just called. He's working the night shift at the E.R.

506
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,665
People are still getting sick.

507
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,434
Car accidents are happening.

508
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:48,041
Babies are are being born.

509
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:50,331
Well, i'm glad he's not home.

510
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:53,138
I had to talk to you.

511
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,023
Nobody else is saying the 
right thing about this.

512
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:02,747
My god, you're really upset.

513
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:05,184
What's that about?

514
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,334
Because there's nothing 
funny about this.

515
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:17,622
Well...

516
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:20,160
Hang in there, red.

517
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:21,939
You too.

518
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,252
Bye-Bye.

519
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,084
Goodbye.

520
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:37,725
Put him on a standby of 
indeterminate length, will you?

521
00:34:46,895 --> 00:34:50,656
Clearers are pushing.
There is Lee Oswald.

522
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:54,353
He's been shot.

523
00:34:54,388 --> 00:34:56,882
- Oh my god. Oh my god.
- What happened?

524
00:34:56,939 --> 00:34:57,941
Lee Oswald has been shot.

525
00:34:57,976 --> 00:34:59,222
They shot him.

526
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:01,176
The police were walking him 
through the building

527
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:03,031
And some man ran up and shot him.

528
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:04,277
What?

529
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:07,770
What is going on?!

530
00:35:10,056 --> 00:35:12,639
Oswald has been shot.
There is no question about it.

531
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:14,187
Don, please leave me alone.

532
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:15,983
Betts?

533
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:18,385
Pandemonium has broken loose  here in the
basement of dallas police headquarters.

534
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,846
What happened?

535
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:28,316
Nothing.

536
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:30,078
Go upstairs.

537
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:39,956
The family, incidentally, asked
that there be no flowers

538
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:42,627
But there nevertheless
have been flowers.

539
00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:46,001
And one room or two rooms 
in the white house

540
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:50,668
Have had to be set aside to-- 
To host.

541
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:59,066
I'm going out.

542
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:04,650
Where?

543
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:06,243
For a drive.

544
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:07,794
Let me drive.

545
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:10,705
I'll get the kids. We'll all go somewhere.

546
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:13,544
- That's a good idea.
- No. 

547
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,883
I need to clear my head.

548
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:47,892
I'm so glad you could see me.

549
00:36:49,014 --> 00:36:50,817
Where does your husband think you are?

550
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:52,450
I don't care.

551
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:55,111
He's been lying to me for years.

552
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:56,673
I couldn't be in that house.

553
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,792
Then I saw you yesterday.

554
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:04,322
I didn't know you were going to be there.

555
00:37:05,602 --> 00:37:07,439
I hoped you would be there.

556
00:37:08,548 --> 00:37:10,140
Derby day...

557
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:13,842
It seems like 100 years ago.

558
00:37:16,973 --> 00:37:20,312
And then this morning, seeing that
man shot to death...

559
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:24,413
what is going on?

560
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,416
It will be okay.

561
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,161
We've lost a lot of presidents
and we're still standing.

562
00:37:30,092 --> 00:37:31,870
I wish I could believe you.

563
00:37:33,256 --> 00:37:35,224
I can't believe anything right now.

564
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,218
Have you thought that there are
other ways to live?

565
00:37:42,074 --> 00:37:45,334
Listen. I'm not in love with 
the tragedy of this thing.

566
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,388
It's not "Romeo and juliet."

567
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,213
I want it to happen.

568
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:52,341
I have three children.

569
00:37:53,176 --> 00:37:56,079
I'll know more when the primaries 
start to shake out in spring,

570
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:59,110
But i can leave the campaign right now.

571
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:01,422
I don't want you to do that.

572
00:38:09,669 --> 00:38:11,417
You don't have to answer me now...

573
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:14,915
But i want to marry you.

574
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:21,620
I don't know what to say.

575
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,378
You don't have to say anything.

576
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:24,767
I told you.

577
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:26,919
But if you search your heart,

578
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:31,058
You'll know that I 
can make you happy.

579
00:38:51,216 --> 00:38:52,646
I should go.

580
00:38:54,688 --> 00:38:56,779
I wish i could take you to the movies right now,

581
00:38:58,624 --> 00:39:01,614
Some theater that's playing
your favorite movie.

582
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:06,356
"Singing in the rain."

583
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,537
Well, just think about that.

584
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,641
...it was made possible
by a special equipment,

585
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:38,208
it will move at one fourth speed,

586
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:42,662
so we would like to show you in slow
motion the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald now.

587
00:39:45,562 --> 00:39:47,385
They just stood there.

588
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:50,570
No security for the most wanted man
in America.

589
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,136
He didn't even have a trial.

590
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:55,279
Just throw him over the mob.

591
00:39:55,746 --> 00:40:00,320
You can see the two detectives, 
one in a light suit, one in a dark,

592
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:01,843
bringing Oswald out.

593
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:05,028
The camera changes its length,
for a close up of Oswald.

594
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,992
The shot has been fired, you cannot 
hear it in this version of the tape.

595
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:13,950
Oswald falls and the man with the hat moves in
on him and he's grabbed by the man in light.

596
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:18,104
Do not go in to work tomorrow.

597
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:19,664
No, of course not.

598
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:22,080
It's a national day of mourning.

599
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,839
You're going to go on Tuesday.

600
00:40:25,752 --> 00:40:27,605
That's another happy thought.

601
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:31,814
Those people don't care about you.

602
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:33,956
And honestly, what's the difference?

603
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:35,962
What are you saying?

604
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,426
You did everything they asked you to do,
but...

605
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:41,600
You don't owe them anything.

606
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,922
You should start gathering your clients.

607
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,379
They'll follow you
wherever you go.

608
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,543
The only other president buried there
is William Howard Taft.

609
00:41:02,578 --> 00:41:07,100
Though of course, there are many 
other heroes of perhaps lesser renown.

610
00:41:15,789 --> 00:41:17,793
Francine has the kids.

611
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:23,296
I don't know where to begin.

612
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:25,657
What?

613
00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:30,250
I want...

614
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:32,469
To scream at you.

615
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:34,969
For ruining all of this.

616
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,161
But...

617
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,353
Then you try to fix it and...

618
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:44,278
There's no point.

619
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:47,132
There's no point, Don.

620
00:41:52,021 --> 00:41:54,041
You're very upset, I understand.

621
00:41:56,444 --> 00:41:58,519
I know it's painful.

622
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:01,047
But it's going to pass.

623
00:42:03,512 --> 00:42:05,446
I don't love you.

624
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:07,413
Betts, don't.

625
00:42:08,833 --> 00:42:10,112
You're distraught.

626
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:11,777
It's true.

627
00:42:12,608 --> 00:42:15,183
But I don't love you anymore.

628
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:18,839
I know that.

629
00:42:18,874 --> 00:42:20,156
Stop it.

630
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:22,124
I kissed you yesterday.

631
00:42:23,781 --> 00:42:26,192
And I didn't feel a thing.

632
00:42:32,465 --> 00:42:34,047
You'll feel better tomorrow.

633
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:35,960
You'll see.

634
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:38,613
You can't even hear me
right now.

635
00:42:39,646 --> 00:42:41,264
You're right.

636
00:44:00,956 --> 00:44:01,911
Morning.

637
00:44:01,946 --> 00:44:04,115
- Morning, daddy.
- Morning.

638
00:44:09,218 --> 00:44:10,410
Where are you going?

639
00:44:10,653 --> 00:44:13,009
I have to go to work, I'm sorry.

640
00:44:13,044 --> 00:44:14,255
It's cold outside.

641
00:44:14,711 --> 00:44:16,039
I'm fine.

642
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,215
Peggy.

643
00:44:53,772 --> 00:44:55,131
What are you doing here?

644
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,218
I don't know. Aqua Net.

645
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:09,982
It doesn't shoot till after
Thanksgiving.

646
00:45:12,148 --> 00:45:13,667
We'll be ok.

647
00:45:22,432 --> 00:45:24,171
What do you have?

648
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:25,994
What are you doing here?

649
00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:27,783
The bars are closed.

650
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,199
My roommate invited over half the
building so they can watch TV

651
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,456
and write condolence letters
to Jackie.

652
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:39,496
Then I went to my sister's and
my mother was crying...

653
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:41,825
and praying so hard.

654
00:45:42,755 --> 00:45:45,377
There wasn't room for anyone else
to feel anything.

655
00:45:50,198 --> 00:45:51,945
The funeral has already started.

656
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:54,937
I was gonna watch it in Cooper's office.

657
00:45:54,972 --> 00:45:56,406
Is it ok?

658
00:45:57,614 --> 00:45:58,903
Yeah.

659
00:46:05,757 --> 00:46:07,575
Are you coming?

660
00:46:32,343 --> 00:46:37,767

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
