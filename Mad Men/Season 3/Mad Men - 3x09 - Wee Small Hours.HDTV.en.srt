1
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,400
Hello?

2
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,700
Do you ever pray
on a difficult problem?

3
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,800
Connie.

4
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,000
I had this revelation--

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,400
New york city is not
a domestic destination Like say dallas.

6
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm sorry. What?

7
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
You know, god speaks to us.

8
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,400
We have an impulse
and we act on it.

9
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,400
- That's very interesting.
- How do we know to do it, don?

10
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,600
How do we know
too something?

11
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,800
Instinct.

12
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,600
So you're just like a dog?

13
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,000
I knew the patina of the waldorf
Would shine over all my domestic properties,

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But it hasn't worked abroad.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,300
I know i just gave you new york,
But can you help me with that?

16
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,800
You want me to take
your international business, connie?

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,700
I want you to earn it.

18
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,600
A little bit of "wow,"
As a lady friend of mine used to say.

19
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,600
Let me think on that.

20
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,700
It sounds like pride,
but i want hiltons all over the world,

21
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
Like missions.

22
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
I want a hilton on the moon.
That's where we're headed.

23
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,300
Okay.

24
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,600
America is wherever we look,
Wherever we're going to be.

25
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,600
That's very good, connie.

26
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,200
You're the one who said that to me.

27
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,500
Well, i guess it's not that memorable.

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Write up a proposal for the new york hiltons
as convention spaces

29
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,000
And send it over
to me by noon.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
- I'll take it on the plane.
- Done.

31
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Goodbye.

32
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,700
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.

33
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,100
I don't think the 4:00 a.M.
Feedings are over yet.

34
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,800
"I want what i want when i want it,"

35
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,700
And you don't care
what it does to the rest of us.

36
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Like someone else i know.

37
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,700
The baby's up every three hours.
Hilton only calls every four.

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,900
I think you like it.

39
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,400
What are you doing?

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,800
I can't sleep.
I'm going in.

41
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,300
What are you doing?

42
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,900
- I'm running.
- In the dark?

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,800
It's cool,
it's quiet

44
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,400
And no one bothers me.

45
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,300
You're wrong about that.

46
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,100
Let me give you a ride.
Where are you going?

47
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,200
I'm going home,
And the whole idea is to run there.

48
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,200
Well, take a break.
Do you smoke?

49
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Take me up to ross lane.

50
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't.

51
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,800
When school starts, I'm going to
read it to the kids the first day.

52
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,600
Do you think
they can understand it?

53
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,000
I think they already know it

54
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
And it'd be nice for them
to hear an adult say it.

55
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,200
Who are you?

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I mean...

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,400
Dumb or pure?

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,800
Running out here in the middle
of the night and i run into you.

59
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,600
How did that happen?

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,700
What are you doing on the road?

61
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,400
I don't know.
I can't sleep.

62
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,800
- Right or left.
- Just let me out up here.

63
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,700
It's a nice house.

64
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,600
I rent the apartment over the garage.

65
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,700
- Have coffee with me.
- You'll be late for work.

66
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm always late.

67
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,800
It's coffee.

68
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,400
Uh-Huh.

69
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,400
Maybe that's why you can't sleep--

70
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,700
Too much coffee.

71
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,400
- Good morning.
- Oh.

72
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,300
Sorry.

73
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,600
How long have you been there?
I had no idea.

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,400
Can you get me
some coffee, please?

75
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,400
And i need you to type this up And
get it to hilton before he leaves for europe.

76
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,500
Actually, he's going to california.

77
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,400
He already left two messages on the service.
Do you want me to get him?

78
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,900
This. Coffee. Hilton.

79
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,500
Of course.

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,900
Mr. Draper usually brings this in.

81
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,000
He left early.

82
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,600
- Can we go outside now?
- It's raining. Go upstairs.

83
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,400
I did not sleep last night.

84
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,900
Go take a nap.
I'll shop in the afternoon.

85
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,500
??

86
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,200
It could either be
the view of the acropolis,

87
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,400
Or just these big columns,
like you're standing there.

88
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,600
Then below it
"your window on the world.

89
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,500
Hilton, Period."

90
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,200
That window looks as old
to me as those columns.

91
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,300
Did anybody look at a picture
of the athens hilton?

92
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,500
Sliding doors
don't read as windows.

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,800
And believe it or not,
we're not allowed to pretend that

94
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,600
That's the view from the window
of the hilton, because it's not.

95
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
Other than that?

96
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,500
The tag is flat.

97
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,700
Well, that one's yours.

98
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,800
That doesn't make it good.
If it's bad, don't use it.

99
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,300
- What else?
- Uh...

100
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,200
There are 16 graphically perfect Reduced
photographs of hilton hotels all on a grid,

101
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,500
A simple headline.

102
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,800
"You go. We'll meet you anywhere."

103
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
Now that i can finally understand you,

104
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,100
I am less impressed
with what you have to say.

105
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
That's your work too.

106
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,300
- Who is "we"?
- "We" are hilton.

107
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,400
And how do i know that?

108
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Take out a magnifying glass
and look at one of those tiny hotels?

109
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,600
I write "hilton" very big under this greek.

110
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,200
There is no deadline.

111
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,100
I want to see work as you think of it.
Give me more ideas to reject.

112
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
I can't do this all by myself.

113
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,700
I'm telling you it's bad for me.

114
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,500
What's that supposed to mean?

115
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
And cut!

116
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
Well, i think we've finally got it.

117
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,100
I told you-- You had it the first time
if that's what you want.

118
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,400
And i told you
i want what you want.

119
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,300
- Where is he supposed to be looking?
- Onto the horizon.

120
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,700
We want people
to focus on the lucky.

121
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,200
This is what your father
signed off on.

122
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
- Let me see it again.
- Nathaniel, again, please.

123
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
Watch through the camera.

124
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
That's a good idea.

125
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,300
Action.

126
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,600
I just don't know what he's looking at.

127
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I want him staring
right at us at the end.

128
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,900
There's a style for
the draw on these spots,

129
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,800
And it's stop, inhale,
thousand-Yard stare.

130
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,800
Tell me what you think.

131
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,800
I think you're the client
and we should do what you want.

132
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,800
It can make people very uncomfortable.

133
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,700
Walter cronkite does it every night.

134
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,900
Now let's take a risk together,
shall we, sally?

135
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,600
Going again.

136
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,700
This time, nathaniel,
on the draw Look right in the lens.

137
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,900
We have to get a pencil case.

138
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
What's wrong with your pencil box?

139
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,900
How was the first day?

140
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,900
I wish i could've found the camera

141
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,400
Just so we could see
the difference on your face

142
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,000
From when you left this morning
to when i picked you up.

143
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,200
- So you like your teacher?
- She's okay.

144
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,900
It's mrs. Patton.
All they do is draw.

145
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,000
- Is this today's mail?
- Uh-Huh.

146
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,400
- I'll get him.
- Would you?

147
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,100
You're so quiet.
You must be tired.

148
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm not tired.

149
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,700
I really want a pencil case
To put in my loose-Leaf.

150
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,300
We'll see.

151
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,400
Cut.

152
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,300
- So it's a rhythm?
- That's true.

153
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
Obviously it'll sound better
with the announcer's voice.

154
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,200
It sounded like you had
half of a pastrami in your mouth.

155
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
It's a scratch track.

156
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,300
I didn't know you were
going to show it to the client.

157
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,200
I know i'm supposed to
stay away till the screening,

158
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,300
But i am fascinated by this process.

159
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,000
Oh, you're thinking about getting out
of cigarettes and into the movies?

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,700
Not while my father's alive.

161
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,500
Well, if we rerecord the sound tonight,
We can probably finish this.

162
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,000
I heard you the first time.

163
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll be in the booth.

164
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I'd appreciate it if you'd...

165
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,800
Forget all that nonsense
i was saying before.

166
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,600
What are you talking about?

167
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,700
The movies, my father.

168
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Forgotten.

169
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,000
Sorry, but i had a long, wet lunch.

170
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,400
Oh, really? Too much to drink?

171
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
And other things.

172
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,600
Secretaries nowadays,
they don't give you a choice.

173
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,900
You know what i mean?

174
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,300
I don't have a secretary.

175
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,900
- How'd my shot turn out?
- I'm not sure.

176
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,700
I think it's gonna feel strange.

177
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,100
Lucky strike has a way of doing things.

178
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,700
Look at this.

179
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,000
Hmm. Yeah, see?

180
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,200
I don't think that's so bad.

181
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,500
Come on. He's not
coming back for a while.

182
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
I'll lock the door.

183
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm married.

184
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,900
So am i.

185
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,200
There's been a misunderstanding.

186
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,900
I know what i know.

187
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,200
Jerry should have the tracks done.

188
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,300
You can see the whole thing
tomorrow or when it's done.

189
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,700
I'll probably be busy tomorrow.

190
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,900
I've got it. You're at work.

191
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
That's too bad.

192
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,700
"Henry, i'm so pleased there's
a place That i can write to you.

193
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,200
The children are
finally back in school now

194
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,500
And i must admit that i like the idea of
looking forward To the mail's arrival every day.

195
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,800
Well, not every day.
Ha ha.

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,500
I don't write many letters anymore,

197
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,800
So i apologize in advance If i'm
unable to accurately express my thoughts.

198
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,000
But i do have thoughts,

199
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,000
And i suppose i wonder too much
Where you are and what you're doing.

200
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,200
We've only met three times,
you know that?

201
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,000
Isn't that strange?

202
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,300
I wish i had a clearer
picture of you in my mind.

203
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,100
Anyway, that's all i have to report.

204
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,000
I hope to hear from you. B."

205
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,100
- Don't touch it.
- I've seen this one.

206
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,500
- It whitens.
- It's not about what you want to watch.

207
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
I have to make sure
they run every commercial.

208
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,600
My mother-In-Law says
i look like perry mason.

209
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,400
It's not a compliment.
It means she thinks you're fat.

210
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
- Crane.
- Harry,

211
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,100
it's lee garner.

212
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,900
I knew you'd still be there.

213
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,100
- You work hard, don't you?
- For you? You bet.

214
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,500
Look, i don't want to keep you,
But i have a bit of a problem.

215
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,700
What's wrong?

216
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,000
It's that salvatore fella, the director.

217
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,500
He's no good. I'd like him gone.

218
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,900
- Oh. What happened?
- I can't work with him.

219
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,400
Get rid of him.

220
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,400
- Well, i can't do that.
- Excuse me?

221
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,800
No, i'm not-- Really, i can't.

222
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,700
Pete and roger handle your account.

223
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,600
No no. No no no, harry.

224
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,800
I want you to take care of this

225
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,200
And i want you to keep it
just between us.

226
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,400
Crane, are you there?

227
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,100
Listen, lee.

228
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,800
I hope you know
the commercial's turning out beautiful.

229
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,400
You really have an eye, you know.

230
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,700
- I do, do i?
- Are you enjoying the city?

231
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,900
I am. Plenty to do.

232
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,800
Well, you have a good night.

233
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,800
- I should get back to work.
- Sorry to trouble you.

234
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

235
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,600
- What was that?
- You don't want to know.

236
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,900
I think i do.

237
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,700
I can't tell you.

238
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,700
Now i really do.

239
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
Lee garner jr.
Asked me to get rid of sal.

240
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,400
- What did he do?
- I didn't ask.

241
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,600
He was drunk as a skunk
and he's scary to begin with.

242
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,300
What are you gonna do, call campbell?

243
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,800
That's the other thing.
He said to keep it between us.

244
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,100
What are you gonna do?

245
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,400
I'm not gonna panic and do
something stupid like i usually do.

246
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,200
That's a good start.

247
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,900
I can't really do anything, can i?

248
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,700
He was really drunk.

249
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,900
The show's on.

250
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,600
Great, i missed all the commercials.

251
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,800
- Hello?
- Don, it's conrad hilton.

252
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,000
- Is it?
- Now don't be like that.

253
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
I know it's a privilege
to call you at home.

254
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,800
I don't think i've worn it out.

255
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,900
It's 11:30.

256
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,200
It's not a problem, connie.

257
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,500
Can you come have a drink with me?

258
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,500
Right now?

259
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,400
You can say no.
I've heard it before.

260
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,100
And for all you know,
you're not the first person i asked.

261
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,300
I'll be there.

262
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,700
Give me an hour.

263
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,400
Hello?

264
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,500
So what is that, moonshine?

265
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,900
No, but it is from prohibition.

266
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,900
I have two cases And they both
say "hair tonic" on the side.

267
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,900
I remember this.

268
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,600
I think you know
i'm in a bit of a crisis tonight.

269
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,100
I didn't know that.

270
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,500
I think about my business day and night

271
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,500
And i'm a harsh critic,
Especially of myself.

272
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,800
And sometimes it collects
And i feel bad.

273
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,200
And then i realize

274
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,400
Maybe that's the reason
i'm so lonesome.

275
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,500
You might be working too much.

276
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm not working enough.

277
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,100
It's my purpose in life
To bring america to the world,

278
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Whether they like it or not.

279
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,600
You know, we are a force of good, don,

280
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Because we have god.

281
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,500
The communists don't.

282
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,500
It's their most important belief.
Did you know that?

283
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm not an expert.

284
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,400
Generosity.

285
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,400
The marshall plan--
You remember that.

286
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,500
Everyone who saw our ways
Wanted to be us.

287
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm glad you're telling me this.

288
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,900
After all the things
we threw at khrushchev,

289
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,600
You know what made him fall apart?

290
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,400
He couldn't get into disneyland.

291
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,900
That's good.

292
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
You never heard that?

293
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,600
Well, i did, but when i hear you
say it It sounds beautiful.

294
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't want any politics in my campaign.
You know that.

295
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,800
But there should be

296
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,700
Goodness And...

297
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,400
confidence.

298
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,600
Thanks for listening to me, don.

299
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,600
You know, sometimes i look around here,

300
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,700
And i think

301
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,300
"By golly, I'm king midas."

302
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,000
Stop it.

303
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,600
You're not.

304
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,800
You're my angel, you know that?

305
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,500
You're like a son.

306
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,300
In fact,

307
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,800
Sometimes you're more than a son to me,

308
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,900
Because you didn't have What they had

309
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,900
And you understand.

310
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,300
Thank you.

311
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,800
I mean it.

312
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,100
Come in, come in, come in.

313
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,300
I drove all the way down to get the mail,
And then i turned around and i debated it.

314
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,400
I went past the exit a dozen times.

315
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,100
My girl is due back.

316
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,300
I know i shouldn't be here.

317
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,300
It's just i wanted to see you.

318
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,500
I wasn't thinking.

319
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,300
What do i say?
Why are you here?

320
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,700
Oh, there you are.

321
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
Carla, this is henry francis.

322
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,700
- He works for governor rockefeller.
- It's nice to meet you.

323
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,100
So anyway, i, uh--

324
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,800
I think this is an excellent venue
for a fundraiser.

325
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Oh. Good.

326
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,800
- I'll have to check with my husband.
- Of course.

327
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,700
Carla, will you show mr. Francis out?

328
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,400
I think i left the bath running.

329
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,500
A pleasure to meet you.

330
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,300
??

331
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,000
I-- I can't get this.
Lucy, do you mind?

332
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,000
Jesus. Knock it off.

333
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,000
It's a lucky strike commercial.
It's got three cuts in it.

334
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,800
So the hillbilly says,
"That ain't my finger."

335
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm gonna have to hear
the beginning of that joke.

336
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
Lee?

337
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Lee!

338
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,900
- What's going on?
- I-- I have no idea.

339
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,700
Does someone know
what's going on? Speak up.

340
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,900
I know.

341
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,800
Lee garner jr. Called me
a couple of days ago. I'm sorry.

342
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,200
Why is he calling you?

343
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
I don't know.

344
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,400
He did and he told me to get rid of sal.

345
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,300
What?

346
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,000
And you made an executive
decision to do nothing?

347
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
He was really drunk.
I thought it would blow over.

348
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,400
I didn't even think he'd remember.

349
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,600
When you get in trouble,
you call mommy and daddy.

350
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,000
He told me not to tell you,
so what was i supposed to do?

351
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,700
Everyone's an account man.
What exactly do you think we do here, crane?

352
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,500
We handle clients.

353
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
He wouldn't say a word.
He just left.

354
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,100
Sal, you're fired.

355
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,400
- Are you serious?
- Lee garner jr. Wants you fired.

356
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,900
We're gonna find out
what he wants to do with you, imbecile.

357
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,200
Oh god.

358
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,000
What the hell happened?

359
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,800
What is going on?

360
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Now you're gonna use your dying breath
To tell don to fix this.

361
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,200
Don?

362
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,800
Lee garner has a problem with creative,
Let don solve it. He does it all now anyway.

363
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,200
Now!

364
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,800
- What did lee say to you?
- Nothing. I have to talk to don.

365
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,300
- Let me talk to don.
- I'm doing as i'm told.

366
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Is he busy?

367
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,500
I can see you and i can hear you.
What do you want?

368
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,700
Who died?

369
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,700
I... screwed up with lee garner jr.

370
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,300
- What?
- How do i explain this?

371
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,300
- He told harry to fire me.
- Harry?

372
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,400
I didn't, but now roger did.

373
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,100
- Roger did what?
- He fired me.

374
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,000
Roger said to tell you to fix it.
Those are his words.

375
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,000
Fantastic.

376
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,500
That's a $25 million account
you stuck your nose in, crane.

377
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,700
Just get out.

378
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,800
What happened?

379
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,500
Lee garner got drunk
And he told harry to fire me.

380
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,400
Then roger got angry and he did.

381
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,300
I think if i get away from lucky strike

382
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,800
And lay low from roger for a day or two,
everything will be fine.

383
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,400
I understand what just happened.
What happened with the cut?

384
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,500
Oh, the commercial's fine.

385
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,600
Sal, something must've happened.

386
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,700
I can't help you unless you tell me.

387
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,200
We... had a misunderstanding.

388
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,500
Jesus. I'm not gonna ask again.

389
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,500
He was drunk

390
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,500
and he cornered me in the editing room.

391
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
- Cornered you?
- Yes.

392
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,300
And i backed him off,

393
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,300
I told him i was married,
He was embarrassed and he left.

394
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,100
You must've been really shocked.

395
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,300
I was, believe me.

396
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,400
But nothing happened

397
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Because nothing could've happened
because you're married.

398
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,500
Don, i swear on my mother's life.

399
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,300
Are you sure you want to do that?

400
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,200
Who do you think you're talking to?

401
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,500
I guess i was just supposed
to do whatever he wanted?

402
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,400
What-- What if it was some girl?

403
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
That would depend on
what kind of girl it was

404
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,000
And what i knew about her.

405
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,900
You people.

406
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,700
I didn't do anything
but turn him down.

407
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,100
He's a bully.

408
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,900
Lucky strike can shut off our lights.

409
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,600
I think you know that
this is the way this has to be.

410
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,000
You'll do fine.

411
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,900
Get me lee garner jr.

412
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,800
I said i don't want salad.

413
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,700
Watch your tone, young man.

414
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Carla works for me, not you.

415
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,000
What do you want instead?

416
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,700
You might as well call it a day.

417
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,500
Okay. Thank you.

418
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi.

419
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,800
How was your day?

420
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,500
Not good.

421
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,100
I didn't want to bother you with it,

422
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,600
But that man dropped by today
from the governor's office.

423
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,900
Carla met him.

424
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,000
Francine sent him over here.

425
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,300
They want to have a fundraiser,
but her house isn't big enough.

426
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,300
I don't care,
as long as i don't have to go.

427
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,000
- When is it?
- Well, i should be going.

428
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,200
Soon. Next week, i think.

429
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,100
A fundraiser for rockefeller.

430
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,900
For the campaign.

431
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,100
I'm gonna go lay down.

432
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,100
- Good night, carl
- Good night.

433
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,200
Good night, children.

434
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,100
- Good night.
- Bye.

435
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,700
Good night, mrs. Draper.

436
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,700
If you're here, do i have to be here?

437
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,100
Because i'm leaving.

438
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,000
No, go ahead.

439
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,900
Good night, boss.

440
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800
- Henry francis.
- Hello.

441
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,800
I thought i'd get the service.

442
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,500
This is betty... draper.

443
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,300
I know that.

444
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,900
Listen, i shouldn't
have come by like that.

445
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,100
I hope i'm not calling too late.

446
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,400
No, you're not.

447
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,100
I checked with my husband
about the fundraiser.

448
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,800
The fundraiser?

449
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,100
Yes, we'd be glad to do that.

450
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,500
How's tuesday the 17th?

451
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,100
Can you make it then?
Is that good for you?

452
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Okay.

453
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,300
I guess you're going through with this.

454
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,500
I had to.

455
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,400
I'll have my girl call you
tomorrow to make it official.

456
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,100
I look forward to it.

457
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Let me know what's
usually provided by the host.

458
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,900
Sure.

459
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,900
Goodbye.

460
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,400
??

461
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,700
Rome, tehran, tokyo
Are magnificent destinations

462
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,700
And that's really been the focus of almost
every campaign You've had up till now--

463
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,600
How to lure the american traveler abroad.

464
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,800
What more do we need than a picture
of athens To get our hearts racing?

465
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,600
And yet the average american
experiences a level of luxury

466
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,600
That belongs only to kings
In most of the world.

467
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,900
We're not chauvinists.

468
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,100
We just have expectations.

469
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:20,500
Well, now there's one word that
promises The thrill of international travel

470
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,700
With the comfort of home:

471
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,400
"Hilton."

472
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,800
"How do you say ice water in italian?

473
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,600
'Hilton.'"

474
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,800
"How do you say fresh towels in farsi?

475
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,000
'Hilton.'"

476
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,900
"How do you say hamburger in japanese?

477
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,800
'Hilton.'"

478
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
"Hilton."

479
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,400
It's the same in every language.

480
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,700
Maybe fried chicken.

481
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,600
I don't like the sound
of "hamburger" and "hilton."

482
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,700
Besides, "hamburger"
is already a foreign word.

483
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,300
We'll see.

484
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,000
It's good.

485
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,100
Very good.

486
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,300
It's clever, yet friendly.

487
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,700
It draws you in.

488
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,100
But what about the moon?

489
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,000
- Excuse me?
- There's nothing about the moon.

490
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,900
Well, right now,
that's not an actual destination.

491
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,500
That wasn't the point.

492
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,900
I said i wanted hilton on the moon.

493
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,800
I couldn't have been more clear about it.

494
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,700
Well...

495
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,800
I'll admit i misunderstood that.

496
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,700
I'm sure there's a way
to fit that into this.

497
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,300
Well, isn't this something?

498
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,300
I'd like to speak with don in private.

499
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,000
This is a good campaign--
One of the best.

500
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,800
It's modern, it's witty,
it's eye-Catching.

501
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,600
- It will change your business.
- Calm down.

502
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,700
I'm going to speak
very honestly with you.

503
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,100
I don't think folks do that often.

504
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,000
- Probably scared.
- Or they trust my work.

505
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,600
You want me to just
say yes to everything you do?

506
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,500
Most ad men believe That clients are
the thing that gets in the way of good work.

507
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,900
I've never experienced that.

508
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,400
You did not give me what i wanted.

509
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,200
I'm deeply disappointed, don.

510
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,700
This is a great campaign.

511
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,500
Fine.

512
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,300
What do you want from me? Love?

513
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,100
Your work is good.

514
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,000
But when i say i want the moon,

515
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,800
I expect the moon.

516
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,100
I said if he ran, i'd support him.

517
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,100
I haven't decided yet.

518
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,600
I voted for kennedy.
I'll probably vote for him again.

519
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,500
What a nice turnout.

520
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,300
Where's henry francis?

521
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,100
I don't know.
Someone's supposed to talk.

522
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,200
I don't know anything about rockefeller.
That's why i did this.

523
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,800
Well, i want to know how he's
going to deal with the south.

524
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,700
Do you know how bad it must be for the negroes
To descend on washington like that just to be heard?

525
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,700
Segregation is uncivilized.
It's that simple.

526
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,800
You know what my father
says about the south?

527
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,400
It's not 1963, it's 1863.

528
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,700
Oh, thank you.

529
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,700
Uh, mrs. Draper,
i'm elsa kittridge.

530
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,600
- I work with mr. Francis.
- Pleasure to meet you.

531
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,300
I assume he's been delayed.

532
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,000
Actually he asked That i address
the group on behalf of the governor.

533
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,100
Oh.

534
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,900
That's disappointing.

535
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,700
I mean, i don't think it's
going to help your fundraising

536
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,900
When you promise one thing
and deliver another.

537
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,900
Well, perhaps you're right,

538
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,100
But he seemed to think
i was a better match to the group.

539
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
And i am extremely informed.

540
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,100
In fact, i'm the person
who briefs mr. Francis.

541
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,900
I think you'll see i won't embarrass
you in front of your friends.

542
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,900
Please, begin whenever you want.

543
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,900
Oh no, you begin, dear.

544
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,900
Excuse me, my name is betty draper.

545
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,700
Welcome to my home.
We're going to listen to--

546
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,800
Elsa kittridge, associate in
the governor's information office.

547
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,200
First i would like to dispel the rumor
That there is a mandatory contribution tonight.

548
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,000
This is a taking of a pulse,
An exchange of ideas.

549
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,400
Please see that we're not disturbed.

550
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Hey!

551
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,400
Mr. Francis, do you need anything?

552
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,400
No, marjorie, i dropped something.

553
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,000
- Where were you last night?
- Calm down.

554
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,400
Why didn't you come?
Why did you send that-- That woman?

555
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,500
I watched the door
all night like a sap.

556
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm sorry,
but i wanted you to come to me.

557
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,500
Oh, the ego!

558
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,900
Would you listen to me?
You had to come to me.

559
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,600
And why is that?

560
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,600
Because you're married.

561
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,600
No, henry.

562
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,000
- What's wrong?
- Please.

563
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,500
We're locked in this office.

564
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,500
What? On the desk? On the couch?

565
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,300
- We should get a room somewhere.
- No.

566
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,900
It's tawdry.

567
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,500
I'm sorry.

568
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,700
I'm very sorry i started this.

569
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,500
I don't know what you want.

570
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,200
??

571
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,500
Mr. Sterling's here to see you.

572
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,600
Send him in.

573
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,700
I heard conrad hilton left
this building in a huff yesterday.

574
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,200
Who told you that?

575
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,600
You've got your face So deep in hilton's lap,
you're ignoring everything else.

576
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,500
Everything's under control.

577
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,600
You won't even let me meet the man.

578
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,700
What do you think accounts does,
Besides limit your brilliance?

579
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,600
I'd tell you, but i don't
want to hurt your feelings.

580
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,000
Keep joking about it.

581
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,700
We've had two clients in one week
leave here angry-- Important clients.

582
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Is that what you want
this place to be known for?

583
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,400
That and some guy
losing his foot in a lawnmower?

584
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,600
I want to put you on notice
you are in over your head.

585
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,300
These children--

586
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,400
Unoffending, innocent
And beautiful--

587
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,900
Were the victims of one of
the most vicious And tragic crimes

588
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,900
Ever perpetrated against humanity.

589
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,800
You can leave it on your station.
I don't mind.

590
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,500
- It's all right.
- What was that?

591
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,100
The funeral service for the
little girls in birmingham.

592
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,500
It's so horrifying.

593
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,100
Are you okay?

594
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,900
Do you need a day off?

595
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,400
No, i'm fine. Thank you.

596
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,800
I hate to say this,

597
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,500
But it's really made me
wonder about civil rights.

598
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,300
Maybe it's not supposed
to happen right now.

599
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,400
- Hello, mr. Draper.
- Hello.

600
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,200
You just missed bedtime.

601
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,300
They're probably still awake.

602
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,500
No, don't bother with dinner.

603
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,600
We've got chinese takeout.

604
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,000
Listen, marty needs me
to look over this work.

605
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,400
Don't wait up for me.

606
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
I love you too.

607
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,800
Betts.

608
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,800
What?

609
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,800
Hilton just called.

610
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,700
I'm going in.

611
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
I didn't hear the phone.

612
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,700
Go back to sleep.

613
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,000
- Someone's going to see you.
- Then let me in.

614
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,400
This is nice.

615
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,100
What can i do for you?

616
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,700
I don't know. I wanted to talk.

617
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,300
Right.

618
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,300
Says the man as he unbuckles his pants.

619
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,400
What do you want me to say?

620
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,800
You've been flirting with me for months.

621
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,800
So what?

622
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,700
So i can't stop thinking about you.

623
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Because i'm new and different.

624
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,500
Or maybe i'm exactly the same.

625
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,600
Tell me you've run past that stretch of highway
In the past two weeks and not thought of me,

626
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,500
Not looked for me.

627
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,100
But then i have the luxury
of that last half-Mile home

628
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,000
Where i go through every step
of the future until it ends.

629
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,500
I know exactly how it ends.

630
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,600
So what?

631
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,200
You live two miles from here.

632
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,900
Your daughter was my student.
I've seen your wife in the market.

633
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,000
I don't think you've
done this before this way.

634
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,600
I want you.

635
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,400
I don't care.

636
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,900
Doesn't that mean anything
to someone like you?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
