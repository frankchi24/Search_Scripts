1
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:20,295
I don't care if it's windy or rainy,
there's no reason for a shake roof to fail

2
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:21,713
If it's laid right--

3
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:24,282
Except that one.

4
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:28,220
No flashing around the
chimney-- that's gonna cost 'em.

5
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,527
Go around!

6
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:44,236
Now I'm gonna push it up

7
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,772
To 25mph. That's what
we're allowed to do here.

8
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:50,709
You've gotta really pay attention.

9
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:03,855
15 minutes of news and
nothing about the holy father.

10
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,458
He's still dead, ma.

11
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:09,177
<i>The shower cap pulled up?
- Yes.</i>

12
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,563
Piece of junk.

13
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,101
If you want, I'll have gerry
come over and fix your shower.

14
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:20,856
It was fixed, but I think ronnie
the super sneaks in and breaks it.

15
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,241
For all I know, he's going
through my things right now.

16
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:25,293
You don't like getting a
little bit of attention?

17
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,413
Anita, this man does not
look the way you want him to.

18
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,450
I'd offer you a room, but since
mom moved in, I don't have it.

19
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:35,237
I want to move to manhattan.

20
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,289
Really?

21
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,690
It's so far away.

22
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:40,492
It is far,

23
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:42,961
And I commute almost two
hours total every day,

24
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:44,563
Five days a week.

25
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,314
That's an extra week of work each month.

26
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,033
My goodness, I never thought of that.

27
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,836
Pegs, the rents there--
they're outrageous.

28
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:55,207
I know, but I'm already spending
a fortune between subway fare,

29
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,909
Cab fare on late
nights, pantyhose--

30
00:02:57,994 --> 00:03:01,380
If I can't find a newspaper, the
cane on the seats destroys them.

31
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:05,033
And it'll be easy with
that savings and a roommate.

32
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,836
Jeez louise, you've been
really thinking about this.

33
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,722
Ma! That's not good for it!

34
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,694
Why don't you move in here
and we send her to manhattan?

35
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,765
Are you going to be one of those girls?

36
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,503
I am one of those girls.

37
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:29,024
Well, ho-ho, I've observed
your wishes for secrecy,

38
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,809
But now is the time.

39
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,329
Gentlemen...

40
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,649
Imagine the perfect mixture

41
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,952
Of athletics, spectacle and speed.

42
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,589
Jai alai.

43
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,725
Jai alai is like handball,

44
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,894
Only you fling the ball and catch the ball

45
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,946
With this basket thing.

46
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,232
It's more complicated
than that... And dangerous.

47
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,801
<i>I'll leave the loose-leaf,</i>

48
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,136
But it shows the way jai
alai attendance is growing.

49
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:01,039
In seven years, it'll eclipse baseball.

50
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,508
Go ahead, you can laugh,

51
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:06,778
But it's got the same fingerprint
as baseball, only better.

52
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,881
A special stadium called a fronton

53
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:12,217
And you can sit real close, which is a thrill

54
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:14,820
Because the ball goes 175mph.

55
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,689
And it's got patxi.

56
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,258
He's babe ruth, only handsome.

57
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:25,113
This is patxi.

58
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,634
<i>I was looking for boxers, but
I bought his contract instead.</i>

59
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,336
He's the greatest player in the world.

60
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,071
Mel ferrer.

61
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,341
I'm terrified of him
catching balls in the face.

62
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:40,679
So let's say

63
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:42,947
There's enough money.

64
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:45,951
How would you chop it up?

65
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:48,220
Well, most of it's going
to end up in television.

66
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,272
Perfect, because I want a tv show.

67
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,324
- A sports show?
- Did you see patxi?

68
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,627
You don't see him flying around the world,

69
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,429
Solving crimes and banging broads?

70
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,583
Harry has excellent
relationships with the networks.

71
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,035
Well, it'll probably have to be abc.

72
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,937
No no.

73
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,223
<i>I want to be on all the networks,</i>

74
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:10,441
Like when the president addresses the nation.

75
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:13,411
Tuesday night, 8:30-9:00,

76
00:05:13,496 --> 00:05:16,214
All three networks--
the same show.

77
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,784
No one's ever done it.

78
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,570
Because...

79
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:25,223
That's true.

80
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,528
How about a star-studded

81
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,248
<i>Big musical special with a jai alai match.</i>

82
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:36,735
- Desi arnaz.
- What else you got?

83
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:39,371
- Well, there's print.
- Women's magazines.

84
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:41,923
A glamorous night in miami

85
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,943
- With a free admission.
- Tuesday night is ladies' night.

86
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,980
And of course newspapers are key, but you
can't limit yourself to less than 10 markets.

87
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,715
This is impressive.

88
00:05:53,085 --> 00:05:56,137
- Don't get up.
- Horace, this is don draper.

89
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,106
I told you he'd be stopping by.

90
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,857
Don't let me interrupt.

91
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,027
So far for the jai alai campaign:

92
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:04,296
<i>Sterling cooper will
produce an adventure program,</i>

93
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,848
Starring your handsome fella,

94
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:09,935
- A musical spectacular-- - on all
three networks and it has to be in color.

95
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,004
CBS doesn't have color.

96
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,743
Fine. I'd like to get the
ladies' magazines in color

97
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,630
And maybe a color page in the Sunday paper.

98
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,248
What about radio?

99
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,417
You'll have to take radio the way it is.

100
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,704
I don't think it's worth anyone's time

101
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,973
Unless you're willing to commit to at least

102
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,393
$1 million to start.

103
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:38,129
Sure, but that's a third of my ad budget.

104
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:42,801
Well, as they used to
say at the freshmen mixer,

105
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:45,487
"when you get a yes, you go home."

106
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,572
Only, humps, you never got one.

107
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,229
Listen, draper, I'd love to buy you dinner,

108
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,681
- Run some slogans by
you. - Actually, ho-ho,

109
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,233
We buy you dinner.

110
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,642
That was fun.

111
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,312
I'm going to have to buy
campbell a case of something.

112
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,114
Patxi.

113
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,667
During the depression, I saw somebody throw

114
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,502
A loaf of bread off the back of a truck.

115
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:19,688
It was more dignified.

116
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,340
Are you going to have
trouble sleeping tonight?

117
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,293
I've seen clients far
more defenseless than he.

118
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,679
Well, as the bible says,

119
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:29,981
"enjoy your fatted calf."

120
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,050
Campbell, did you tell him
who this idiot's father is?

121
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,588
He said he's a shipping
magnate, not a client.

122
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:40,125
Horace senior is connected to
bert cooper in a million ways,

123
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:42,594
And I don't know if he would
like what just happened in there.

124
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,929
You want to run it by his daddy?

125
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:48,166
He's my age. So he was
born with a lot of money.

126
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,702
He has a dream and it's our
job to make it come true.

127
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,273
Well, there you have it.

128
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,496
Nicely done, my boy.

129
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,184
Elizabeth.

130
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,737
Get off your feet. It's bad for the baby.

131
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,355
As soon as I finish the dishes.

132
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,257
Sit with me.

133
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,592
You're cleaning up for the maid.

134
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:16,194
You're just like your mother.

135
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,105
I don't like watching you commit suicide.

136
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:28,790
Neither do your kids.

137
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,977
What do you want, daddy?

138
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:39,551
It's-- it's all
laid out in here--

139
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:43,805
My arrangements. Just follow the directions.

140
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,423
I don't want to talabout this.

141
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,592
We talk about it now and
then we don't talk about it.

142
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,461
- That's the idea.
- Fine.

143
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,880
Jesus. Smoke your cigarette.

144
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,237
Funerals are a dishonest business.

145
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,756
People don't want to think about
it-- that's how they get you.

146
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,241
Remember what happened with your mother?

147
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:09,497
The will's translucent,
transparent or something

148
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:11,332
According to the lawyers. You run the show.

149
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,769
You took me in.

150
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,238
Anything else?

151
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:19,924
I want you to have your mother's coats.

152
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,294
I gave judy the hudson seal,

153
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,729
But I want you to have the chinchilla

154
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,265
And obviously the mink.

155
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,434
They're in the cedar closet.

156
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,736
They key's in gloria's end table.

157
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,605
Okay, daddy.

158
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,777
You don't want to hear about it,

159
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,779
Scarlett o'hara?

160
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,480
I have the folder.

161
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:47,001
Oh, you've always been sensitive.

162
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,087
That's my fault for shielding you

163
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,756
From all the dangers out there

164
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,975
That's probably why you married this joker.

165
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,897
If you'd even known what was possible...

166
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,269
But that's that. I wrote it down.

167
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,738
We never have to talk about it again.

168
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:10,208
I don't understand why
you like talking about this

169
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,278
When you can see so
clearly that it upsets me.

170
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,698
You're being selfish and morbid.

171
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:20,084
I'm your little girl.

172
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,720
And I know it must be horrible

173
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,422
To be looking at whatever you're looking at,

174
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,574
But can't you keep it to yourself?

175
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:33,598
What kind of mood is he in?

176
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:35,867
I'm never right.

177
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,419
- Has anybody been outside? Do I need a coat?
- I'd take it.

178
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,005
Don, george caan dropped out of patio

179
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,807
To direct a picture in l.A.

180
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,443
I look forward to his
average work. Replace him.

181
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,529
There's no time and there's no talent.

182
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,414
What were you going to
do if you had to fire him?

183
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:53,117
- Have sal do it.
- Are you serious?

184
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,436
- Sal, do you want to do it?
- Of course I do.

185
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,891
It sounds good, but it makes me very nervous.

186
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,559
It's lifted straight from "bye bye birdie."

187
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,895
It's a single shot. Sal did the storyboards.

188
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:05,964
I could go on, but I don't
think I should have to.

189
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:07,665
- Alison?
- Keen's chophouse.

190
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,333
Thank you, don.

191
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,388
Tag. You're it.

192
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,995
Hey. You don't want to cut towards yourself.

193
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,785
There we go.

194
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:03,338
I've got some great things in here.

195
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,292
This is an exact imitation

196
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,627
Of the gettysburg address.

197
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,413
- You know about honest abe?
- He learned to read by candlelight.

198
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,532
That's right.

199
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,202
Well, I'll be.

200
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,904
Don.

201
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,322
Look at this.

202
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,677
Victory medal, France.

203
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,531
I should have another for beating the clap.

204
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,722
Here we are.

205
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,158
Wow.

206
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,596
That spike--
it's prussian.

207
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:48,316
Germany's greatest soldiers.
You had to respect that.

208
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,370
That's where I got him.

209
00:12:52,454 --> 00:12:54,205
You see that?

210
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:58,009
- Dried blood.
- You shot him?

211
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,045
<i>I think so. I shot lots of them.</i>

212
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,131
They were trying to kill us.

213
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,683
- War is bad.
- Maybe,

214
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:08,519
<i>But it makes a
man out of you--</i>

215
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,621
Living off the land,

216
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,757
Battling the elements,

217
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:15,793
Standing alongside your brothers.

218
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,996
- Ask your pop.
- Gene.

219
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,799
- What?
- Gene, don't.

220
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,936
- Come on.
- Bobby, give it back.

221
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,622
Let him have it! That's why I got it!

222
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,675
- Can't I have it?
- There was a person in that helmet.

223
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,478
- An enemy.
- Bobby, it's a dead man's hat.

224
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:34,812
- Take it off.
- Keep it on.

225
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,850
<i>It's yours.</i>

226
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,574
There was this girl...

227
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:14,051
You like? It was on sale at a&s.

228
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,022
Looks like a lot more than 20% off.

229
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,598
Oh, kitty.

230
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,437
Kitty.

231
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:35,623
Mmm. I'm working.

232
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,817
Something's wrong, isn't it?

233
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,969
No.

234
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,771
No no no, don't say that.

235
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:52,590
Don't say that.

236
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:58,179
I'm not myself.

237
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:00,098
What does that mean?

238
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,038
Why are men so embarrassed
to share their emotions?

239
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,114
Please.

240
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,415
Sal...

241
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,385
The past
few months--

242
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,938
Something's wrong.

243
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:26,240
- That's not true.
- It is true.

244
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,728
You know, I don't need that much,

245
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,764
But I do need tending.

246
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:40,538
I'm so sorry.

247
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,224
Well, what can I do?

248
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:45,893
You won't even tell me.

249
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,280
Make some excuse.

250
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,417
For the last six months,

251
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,052
Maybe a year even,

252
00:15:55,103 --> 00:15:57,355
I've watched my job disappear.

253
00:15:57,422 --> 00:16:00,791
Nobody wants illustrations
anymore. It's all about photography.

254
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,563
And yes, I've been nervous.

255
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:08,783
And now I have this opportunity

256
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,736
To do something that
really does have a future.

257
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,421
So it's been building to this

258
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,407
And tomorrow you will triumph

259
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,843
And come home a conquering hero.

260
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,330
What's wrong with you?

261
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,533
Well, I do have one horrible flaw.

262
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,585
I love you.

263
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,291
I don't want to fail.

264
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,793
- Mmm.
- Just--

265
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:39,163
With a single mistake,
the entire shot is ruined.

266
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,599
So what? You've
seen the movies--

267
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,484
Take two. Take three. Do it again.

268
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:46,870
- Action. - It's one
shot-- the whole thing.

269
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,507
It's the beginning of "bye bye birdie."

270
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,043
Uh, I'm-- I'm
trying to remember.

271
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,278
She starts singing against a blue background

272
00:16:54,363 --> 00:16:56,948
- And her voice is very girlish.
- Oh, yes.

273
00:16:57,032 --> 00:17:00,868
- Yes, I remember that.
- She's offering us this can of patio

274
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:03,504
And she's on a treadmill,
but you can't see it.

275
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:05,389
- She's walking back and forth?
- No no.

276
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,024
She walks towards you.

277
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,245
The wind is blowing in her hair.

278
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,348
And she sings about how
patio is low in calories.

279
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,267
Then she extends her hand out

280
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,502
And she waves goodbye.

281
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,404
<i>Then we move back too,</i>

282
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:23,073
But she stops and she
takes her dress in her hands

283
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,843
And she runs forward as fast as she can.

284
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,596
But then she turns her back

285
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,184
And looks seductively over her shoulder.

286
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,453
The treadmill pulls her back again

287
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:38,339
And she comes towards you one last time,

288
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,591
Dancing right up to the camera.

289
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:42,777
She sort of pushes her shoulders together,

290
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,478
Leans over with the can

291
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:47,415
And she smiles. "hello, patio."

292
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,470
Something like that.

293
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,574
Sound good?

294
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,910
It-- uh, you're
gonna do great.

295
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,623
You really think so?

296
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,342
Yes.

297
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:25,736
<i>Don, I'd like you to meet Horace Cook.</i>

298
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:29,790
- We've met-- Lincoln
Center. - Of course.

299
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:33,510
Have a seat. Lane has
brought it to my attention

300
00:18:33,562 --> 00:18:36,013
That mr. Cooke's son has
approached us for work.

301
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:38,232
Actually, it was don who thought it best,

302
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,534
Out of deference, to include you.

303
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,920
We're not psychiatrists. There is no...

304
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:44,922
Confidentiality.

305
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,942
That's not strictly true, but you are family

306
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,062
And, well, it appears to be a lot of money.

307
00:18:51,129 --> 00:18:53,214
Bert seemed alarmed.

308
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,166
What exactly happened in this meeting?

309
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,186
Well, you know, your son has a dream.

310
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,655
Yes, jai alai.

311
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,458
When he first mentioned it
I assumed he was gambling,

312
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,677
But he seems convinced of
its financial potential.

313
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,963
And there's no reason to doubt that.

314
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,516
Are you drunk? It's like polish handball.

315
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:14,285
You can't even play it
if you're left-handed.

316
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,619
There's no wall on that side.

317
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,056
Well, then that's done
with. We needn't be involved.

318
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,393
Bert, you know that's not
the way the marketplace works.

319
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,162
A man comes through your door,

320
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,531
He knows what he wants, he's
got the money to back it up,

321
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:29,300
You do your best.

322
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,852
Perhaps I'm unclear

323
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,739
Because I'm childless, but they're not.

324
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,327
Well, should you be lucky
enough to strike gold,

325
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:44,148
Remember that your children weren't
there when you were swinging the pick.

326
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:48,619
I've seen his plan. It's gibberish.

327
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,671
But if you refuse him,

328
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,923
He'll only find someone else.

329
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:59,430
My son lives in a cloud of success,

330
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,116
<i>But it's my success.</i>

331
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,753
Perhaps when that evaporates

332
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,973
And his face is pressed against
the reality of the sidewalk

333
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:11,442
He'll be of value to someone.

334
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,148
"kill or be killed,

335
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,250
Eat or be eaten."

336
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,852
That's how I was raised.

337
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,456
So you want us to proceed?

338
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,561
When we put that money aside for him,

339
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:33,147
He was a little boy.

340
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:36,500
We didn't know what kind
of person we were making.

341
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,523
Don't be so hard on yourself.

342
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:46,310
Easy for you to say. He
doesn't have your name.

343
00:20:46,394 --> 00:20:49,497
You'll stay for lunch. There's no discussion.

344
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,216
A pleasure to see you again.

345
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,717
A pleasure.

346
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:59,390
- I'll sign him tonight.
- Very good.

347
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,745
These are ideas.

348
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:06,580
You can skip some if you want to,

349
00:21:06,664 --> 00:21:08,299
<i>But do not go out of order.</i>

350
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,642
Hello, this is Margaret.

351
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,929
Hello, my name is Elaine and I'm 22.

352
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:25,148
I have a good job and I'm
interested in a roommate too.

353
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,718
Well, it's nice to speak with you, elaine.

354
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,786
Where do you work?

355
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,256
Well, I live in teaneck, new jersey,

356
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,825
So I want to be in this
city to be near my job.

357
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,195
I work in a tannery on the west side.

358
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,831
Really? They make leather?

359
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,967
<i>I'm a secretary,</i>

360
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:46,604
But I am around animal skins
and carcasses most of the day,

361
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,405
So I don't keep pets.

362
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,207
<i>The smell makes them go crazy.</i>

363
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,093
Oh.

364
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:56,413
I don't know if the west
side is what I had in mind.

365
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,149
I need someplace near a major hospital.

366
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,486
<i>My face is very badly burnt</i>

367
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:06,223
And I need frequent prescriptions
for unguents and salves.

368
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,777
Oh.

369
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:13,497
<i>- It would have to be two bedrooms.
- Two bedrooms is good.</i>

370
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:18,552
Now... About the bathroom,

371
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:21,121
<i>I'm going to need some help there.</i>

372
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,292
Who is this?

373
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,045
You know something? You're a jerk.

374
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:40,824
Why do you do that?

375
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,459
I've got a salt tooth.

376
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,696
It's right here in the back of my mouth.

377
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,982
Grandpa.

378
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,067
It's getting harder to fool you.

379
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,270
I got two spoons.

380
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,607
Mommy doesn't let us have
ice cream before dinner.

381
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,393
Is she afraid you're
gonna be fat like she was?

382
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,915
Your grandma ruth used to
drive her to town to run errands

383
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,418
and make her walk herself
home. That put a stop to it.

384
00:23:07,502 --> 00:23:11,355
- You remember grandma ruth?
- She gave me a ukulele.

385
00:23:11,406 --> 00:23:12,990
- Did you learn it?
- No.

386
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:14,992
You can, you know. You're smart.

387
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,179
You remind me of your
grandma more than your mother.

388
00:23:20,682 --> 00:23:23,701
You know, she did drafting

389
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,904
In the '20s for
this engineer--

390
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,757
A little bald man. He wasn't a threat.

391
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,809
That's good.

392
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,832
You can really do something.

393
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,518
Don't let your mother tell you otherwise.

394
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,124
You know, she won't let me eat this either,

395
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:48,726
And I don't want to be the only one.

396
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:51,245
So I'll tell you what:

397
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,047
I'm gonna keep a lookout.

398
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:58,902
Okay. Go ahead. The coast is clear.

399
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,438
Oh, she's coming! Quick, hide it!

400
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:03,657
I knew you were gonna do that.

401
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,878
This tastes like chocolate,
but it smells like oranges.

402
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,430
You smell that?

403
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,255
A year from now there'll be nothing

404
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,474
But rum and mexican beer in this place.

405
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,060
- You ever have mexican beer, humps?
- I don't drink a lot of beer.

406
00:24:23,144 --> 00:24:24,728
You have to when
you're there--

407
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:26,814
Amoeba, dysentery.

408
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:28,782
Patxi caught a bug, lost 8 lbs.

409
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:30,634
That's a lot on his frame.

410
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:33,103
Ho-ho was saying a photo of jack kennedy

411
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,072
Enjoying jai alai would be
a tremendous endorsement.

412
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,158
My father hates kennedy,

413
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:40,110
Because he knew old joe when
they were criminals together.

414
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,079
Plus dad's against integration.

415
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,115
He called patxi a wetback.

416
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,502
Jack kennedy certainly ended up
with a better job than his father.

417
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,156
I know this idea sounds crazy,

418
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:53,891
But read your history.

419
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,160
I've got a 50% chance at least.

420
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,329
My father's dead,

421
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,331
But I know he'd be interested.

422
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:03,801
This is his kind of investment.

423
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:05,986
I think about

424
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,271
The way my father made his fortune,

425
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:12,375
Renting ships for troop
transport during the war.

426
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,511
He didn't care about the germans.

427
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,413
And then I think

428
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,816
<i>I could really do something.</i>

429
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,784
I might not be president,

430
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:22,920
But I could-- I
could build something.

431
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:25,089
People will like it.

432
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,024
I'm going to be the father of this sport

433
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,759
<i>And people are going to be
dying to do business with me,</i>

434
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,994
Even my father.

435
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:37,217
I have this image in my mind:

436
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:41,155
It's his 75th birthday

437
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,123
And I give him

438
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:44,975
A team.

439
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,984
I want to give you a piece of advice.

440
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,821
I've been doing this awhile

441
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,606
And I applaud your enthusiasm,

442
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,027
But I think you should take this
decision a little more seriously.

443
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,498
- What are you saying, don?
- No, let him-- let him talk.

444
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,716
You have a great fortune,

445
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,469
And that's not just
money-- that's the future.

446
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,842
We will take all of your
money, I promise you,

447
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,279
<i>But I think you should reevaluate
this particular obsession.</i>

448
00:26:23,698 --> 00:26:25,332
You can do better.

449
00:26:38,162 --> 00:26:39,897
That's a sales technique, isn't it?

450
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,183
You zig away from me

451
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,968
And I zag back into your arms.

452
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:47,654
You know, I've got the
galleys of this book by ogilvy.

453
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,273
I learned a lot about advertising.

454
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:53,126
Then why aren't you
eating dinner with ogilvy?

455
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,262
'cause campbell talked me out of it.

456
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,168
Now let's get one thing straight:

457
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,688
If jai alai fails,

458
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:06,557
It's your fault.

459
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,411
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

460
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,298
<i>Don't apologize. Everybody
thinks that. Nobody says it.</i>

461
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:29,546
Are you removing that or moving it?

462
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:32,432
Did everybody in manhattan decide
I'm not allowed to live here?

463
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:35,252
No. Actually, I think the right girl

464
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:36,953
Could have a very good effect on you.

465
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,624
I do, however, find your ad unfortunate.

466
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:43,560
It's perfect. I proofed it thoroughly.

467
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,297
"clean, responsible, considerate.

468
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:50,467
I have some nice furniture
and a small television."

469
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:53,237
It reads like the stage
directions from an ibsen play.

470
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:57,207
So what then? You'll give me some ideas,

471
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,710
I'll use them and you'll all
have an even bigger laugh?

472
00:27:59,794 --> 00:28:02,178
No, I thought I'd tell
you how to get a roommate.

473
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,847
This is not the way.

474
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:07,601
Fine.

475
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:12,656
Please, joan, tell me how to do it.

476
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:15,359
For one thing, why "margaret"?

477
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:18,562
It's my name and it's more adult.

478
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,915
But this is about two
young girls in manhattan.

479
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,784
<i>This is about an adventure.</i>

480
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,202
Am I wrong?

481
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:30,106
If this were me, I would say something like

482
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:34,278
"fun-loving girl, responsible sometimes.

483
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:37,047
Likes to laugh. Lives to love.

484
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,016
<i>Seeks size 6 for city living</i>

485
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,850
And general gallivanting.

486
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:43,387
No dull moments or dull men tolerated."

487
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:44,871
Or something like that.

488
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:48,158
Well, thank you. That's very helpful.

489
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,662
Don't put it up there.
Everyone here knows you.

490
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:54,698
Branch out.

491
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:56,833
Good night, peggy.

492
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,085
<i>Don. There you are.</i>

493
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:07,337
I was just on my way over to lane.

494
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,072
I've got signatures.

495
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:11,842
Horace Cooke jr. is all
dressed and ready for the oven.

496
00:30:11,926 --> 00:30:13,844
In light of all of the trepidation,

497
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:16,029
Perhaps you should deliver
this to lane yourself.

498
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,257
- Are you following me?
- I spent two years at dartmouth

499
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:30,260
Hiding him from shylocks.
Let me enjoy my payday.

500
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,918
Mr. Hooker, has lane
stopped by the clubhouse?

501
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,836
I'll go and get him.

502
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:44,908
That's called a cesta. It's
made of reeds from the pyrenees.

503
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,493
The ball is called a pelota.

504
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:47,844
<i>They just sent all this over.</i>

505
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,734
So did horace have anymore ideas?

506
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,870
For one thing, he wants
us to call it the n.J.A.A.

507
00:30:56,954 --> 00:31:00,674
National jai alai association?

508
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,260
He has no idea how confused
america's gonna be about that j.

509
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,280
Look at this camaraderie.

510
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:10,166
Perhaps we've discovered
america's pastime after all.

511
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,385
Full steam ahead.

512
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,323
- Bravo, boys.
- How about "Patxi: The motion picture"?

513
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,542
God, I wish I was a part of this.

514
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,243
I've informed the home office.

515
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,312
There was a flutter of adding machines.

516
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:23,814
Well, you heard him, boys.

517
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,450
Don't stop until you see
the whites of his pockets.

518
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,452
Cosgrove.

519
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,287
- Oh!
- Oh! Good god.

520
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,228
Bill it to the kid.

521
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,440
- What the hell is that?
- It's an english muffin.

522
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:52,442
The hell it is. Put it
away. You can eat at school.

523
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:52,976
I already ate reakfast.

524
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:53,660
I already ate

525
00:31:57,915 --> 00:31:59,883
Well, don't keep me waiting this afternoon.

526
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:00,684
I want you dressed and ready
for ballet at 3:00 on the button.

527
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:00,817
I want you dressed and ready for ballet

528
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:01,184
I want you dressed

529
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,770
- No dawdling.
- Okay.

530
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:04,554
- No dawdling.

531
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:09,910
I'm going to buy fruit. What do you want?

532
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,330
- Peaches, please.
- Peaches give me a rash.

533
00:32:13,397 --> 00:32:15,098
Your sister likes 'em.

534
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:20,070
Are you Peggy?

535
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,455
They just sent me back from
reception. I'm Karen Erickson.

536
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,108
Yes, I am. How nice to finally meet you.

537
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,678
Oh, you have your own office.

538
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,148
Wowee. At the travel agency it takes years.

539
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,868
Martha Winston's the only girl
and she's married to the boss.

540
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,887
Well, it's different up here.

541
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:39,689
Everyone on the first floor
loved your humorous ad.

542
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,576
You seem like someone I
could really be friends with,

543
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,361
Not like the last girl.

544
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,047
Well, I'm fun

545
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,433
And I love to have... Fun.

546
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,435
She was always keeping her door shut.

547
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:54,988
I think you should only close
your door for one reason.

548
00:32:55,072 --> 00:32:57,123
What's that?

549
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,575
Oh!

550
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:02,979
I just don't get along
with women like I do men,

551
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:06,249
But she left to get married, so I
must be some kind of good-luck charm.

552
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:10,053
- Do you have a steady?
- No, I'm still playing the field.

553
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:12,472
<i>There are so many
interesting men out there--</i>

554
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:15,158
Except sailors. I have a couple of rules.

555
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,626
One of them is I don't like sailors.

556
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,596
No sailors. I agree.

557
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,399
So, Peggy Olson, I have to ask:

558
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:24,484
Are you swedish? Because I am.

559
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,403
Norwegian.

560
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,590
Well, we won't tell my parents.

561
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,510
I'll make appointments and come by at 5:00.

562
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,111
Or do you want your girl to do it?

563
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,397
I finish up around 6:00.

564
00:33:37,481 --> 00:33:39,549
- Well, then tomorrow?
- Most days.

565
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,252
Can we look on Saturday?

566
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:44,304
- Oh, but not this Saturday.
- Do you work on Saturday?

567
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,723
Not every Saturday. And
Saturday nights never.

568
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,359
I'm out in the city, ready for fun.

569
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,495
<i>Well, okay. I'll call you, roomie.</i>

570
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,665
oh, I got you a sandwich.

571
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,602
Oh. I'm gonna walk around the park.

572
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,154
Well, have fun, roomie.

573
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,824
It's mommy.

574
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:30,150
- Where's grandpa gene?
- It must've slipped his mind.

575
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,570
- Where is he?
- Probably at home.

576
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,422
I'm sure he'll be there when we get home.

577
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,728
I can't even tell you how thorough sal was.

578
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,663
Well, I appreciate that,

579
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,564
But
this is--

580
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:10,934
I don't know. This is not
what I thought it was gonna be.

581
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,586
I'm glad I'm not alone.

582
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,271
Look, I don't think there's any ambiguity

583
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,340
About this
being exactly--

584
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:20,060
And I mean exactly--
what you asked for.

585
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,979
I know, but there's
something not right about it.

586
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,547
What?

587
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:28,251
I, uh, can't put my finger on it.

588
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:30,170
<i>I wish I could but I can't.</i>

589
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:33,223
It's an exact copy--
frame for frame.

590
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:36,726
I'll tell you what: Why don't we send
a dupe back to the office with you?

591
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,195
Uh, no. I'm sorry.

592
00:36:39,246 --> 00:36:41,498
I wish I could explain it,

593
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,533
But it's just not right.

594
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,502
I'm gonna be magnanimous

595
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:48,054
And say it's our idea and our failure,

596
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:50,690
But it is a failure.

597
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:53,576
That is magnanimous.

598
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,581
- I'm sorry about that.
- Maybe next time.

599
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:08,491
It's true. It's not right.

600
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,293
It doesn't make any sense. It looks right.

601
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,429
It sounds right, smells right.

602
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,514
Something's not right. What is it?

603
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:15,832
It's not ann margret.

604
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:35,869
Mommy, there's a policeman! Hurry!

605
00:37:41,625 --> 00:37:43,693
Yes, may I help you?

606
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,095
Are you related to eugene hofstadt?

607
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,064
Yes, I am. What is it?

608
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:51,251
We regret to inform you that he passed away.

609
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,786
- Oh god.
- No!

610
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,288
I'm fine.

611
00:37:58,008 --> 00:38:01,110
- What happened?
- He collapsed in line at the a&p.

612
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,979
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

613
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,500
I,
uh--

614
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:10,753
I--

615
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:13,890
Well, we need to know what
you'd like to do with his body.

616
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,828
Yes, of course.

617
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:41,801
<i>Mr. Romano's here to see you.</i>

618
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:43,436
Send him in.

619
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:50,026
I figured I'd bring myself to the woodshed.

620
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,162
It must be horrible having
a client insist on something

621
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,131
And then change their
mind once they've seen it.

622
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:57,183
I hope it never happens to me.

623
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,468
I was the director and I let you down.

624
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,874
- I'm in a meeting.
- I have mrs. Draper on the line.

625
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,477
- It's urgent.
- I can go.

626
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:13,015
What's the matter?

627
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,458
I'm sorry, betts.

628
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,013
I'm-- I'm
very sorry.

629
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,401
Do you want me to call william?

630
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:36,956
Just stay put. I'll be right there.

631
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,095
- I have to go.
- Is everything okay?

632
00:39:43,597 --> 00:39:45,014
There's nothing you can do.

633
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,086
Don't ruin the only good
thing to come of this.

634
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,005
You are now a commercial director.

635
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:57,844
How do I know you're not just
saying that to make me feel better?

636
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:01,514
You'll know when I hire you again.

637
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:03,366
Alison, I'm going for the day.

638
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,822
Oh. Oh oh oh oh.

639
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:13,509
Okay, ma.

640
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,545
Oh my goodness.

641
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,514
Oh, it's beautiful.

642
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,401
Oh, is that all the noise that this was?

643
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,352
Why didn't you wait for gerry to help?

644
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:25,772
Because he's playing cards
and peggy gets up early.

645
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,408
- Say thank you, ma.
- Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

646
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,429
An admiral. Oh, you must be doing well.

647
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,264
I am.

648
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:37,400
What's the matter, peaches?

649
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:40,370
Sit down, ma.

650
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,706
What's this about?

651
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:48,210
Don't, anita. Stay.

652
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:54,867
Ma, I'm having problems with my apartment,

653
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,887
My commute is
very long and--

654
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,958
Oh, it doesn't mean nothing if
you want to stay here with us.

655
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,310
Your father and I lived with
grandma and grandpa for years.

656
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,662
Your sister was born there.

657
00:41:08,198 --> 00:41:10,817
Ma, I'm getting an apartment in manhattan.

658
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,870
Oh.

659
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:18,374
Well, that makes sense.

660
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:21,043
It really does.

661
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:22,578
Yeah, I guess I'm the kind of mother

662
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,597
Who would rather have a
new tv than a daughter.

663
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:27,233
I got you a new tv because you needed one.

664
00:41:27,317 --> 00:41:29,986
You got me a new tv 'cause
you think I was born yesterday.

665
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,205
You belong in the city.

666
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,207
Do you see this, anita?

667
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,242
This is what they do. Family is cheap.

668
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:38,828
Well, take it back, okay?

669
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:41,848
Because it's just gonna remind
me of how stupid you think I am.

670
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:45,184
Ma! You knew she'd have
to move there eventually.

671
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,492
Someday both of youse is gonna feel this,

672
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,578
This-- this broken
heart I'm carrying.

673
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,417
You'll get raped, you know that?

674
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:05,855
It's just as dangerous as here,

675
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:07,890
And I'm going to have a roommate.

676
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:10,393
She's a nice girl. Her
name is Karen Erickson.

677
00:42:10,477 --> 00:42:12,061
She's Norwegian.

678
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,446
There's a man, isn't there?

679
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,031
No.

680
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,800
Why would I ever believe anything you say?

681
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,536
Stop it, ma. You're being cruel.

682
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:23,840
Good night, ma.

683
00:42:34,234 --> 00:42:36,819
That wasn't so bad.

684
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,404
Really?

685
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:41,007
She's been through a lot of change lately.

686
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:44,293
The holy father dying--
that was very hard on her.

687
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:50,800
<i>It has become one country because all
of us and all the people who came here</i>

688
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:53,436
<i>had an equal chance to develop their talents.</i>

689
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,807
<i>You cannot say to 10% of the population
that you cannot have that right.</i>

690
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:02,879
<i>Eugene Hofstadt #2.</i>

691
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:08,601
Eugene Hofstadt #2.

692
00:43:10,604 --> 00:43:13,022
What does that mean?

693
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:15,942
There were two Eugene Hofstadts at his bank,

694
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:19,061
So he had to be called Eugene Hofstadt #2.

695
00:43:20,914 --> 00:43:24,033
Well, he's with ruth now.

696
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,403
I hope so.

697
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,724
Once he asked,

698
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,976
"what's gonna happen when I get to heaven

699
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,444
And I have two wives?"

700
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:39,265
Knowing Gloria, I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

701
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:50,910
Betts, don't eat that.
It was in his car all day.

702
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,362
I don't care.

703
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,334
- Why are you laughing?
- Sally sweetheart--

704
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,920
- We weren't laughing, honey.
- I heard you.

705
00:44:01,004 --> 00:44:02,922
I heard you laughing.

706
00:44:03,006 --> 00:44:05,808
<i>How can you be sitting there
like nothing's happening?</i>

707
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,960
<i>Like he's not gone?</i>

708
00:44:08,044 --> 00:44:09,795
<i>He was here, now he's not here.</i>

709
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,348
He's gone forever and nobody even knows that.

710
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:15,551
Stop it. You're being hysterical.

711
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:17,970
- Calm down.
- He's dead!

712
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:20,389
He's dead and he's never coming back!

713
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,692
<i>And nobody cares</i>

714
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,194
<i>That he's really really really gone!</i>

715
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,062
Sally, go watch tv.

716
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,412
<i>...Soviet border</i>

717
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:45,915
<i>When the convoy commander rejected commands</i>

718
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:48,251
<i>That his troops leave their
vehicles for a head count.</i>

719
00:44:48,335 --> 00:44:52,171
<i>The russians finally allowed
the convoy to pass. Robert.</i>

720
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:54,924
Dumbstruck police and
horrified crowds gathered

721
00:44:54,975 --> 00:44:56,826
As an elderly buddhist monk

722
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,594
<i>Set fire to himself today,</i>

723
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:01,731
<i>Resulting in his death. The bizarre act was</i>

724
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,599
<i>A protest against the
mostly-catholic government</i>

725
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,268
<i>Of ngo dinh diem of south vietnam</i>

726
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,272
<i>And their supposed
campaign of discrimination.</i>

727
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:12,191
<i>The new york stock exchange today saw</i>

728
00:45:12,275 --> 00:45:14,243
<i>Slight gains and moderate trading</i>

729
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:17,780
<i>As the dow jones industrial
average rose nearly two points.</i>

730
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:21,667
<i>And now here's stan baker
for winston cigarettes.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
