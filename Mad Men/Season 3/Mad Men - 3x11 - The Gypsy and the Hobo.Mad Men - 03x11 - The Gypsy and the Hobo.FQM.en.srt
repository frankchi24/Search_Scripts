16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,100
They sell it at woolworth's.

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,500
There's a section that says
"halloween costumes."

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,800
You'll wear it once. 

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,000
Plus it's made out of plastic and it's crap.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I'm always gonna love minnie mouse.

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,800
I'm gonna be an astronaut.

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,400
Didn't you hear me? The luggage.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,100
- I'll go get it.
- That's not the point. They don't listen.

24
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
There's more? It's a week.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,300
We're going for a week?
Are we gonna miss halloween? 

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,000
hey have halloween there.
You'll go with your cousins.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,900
Say goodbye to your father,
Then get the bags.

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,600
Ooh!

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,500
They have a woolworth's in philly, too.

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,300
I only have $40.

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Swing by the bank.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,900
There should be at least
$200 in your checking.

33
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,500
- That's plenty.
- You have no more money?

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Take care.

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,400
- Roger, i think you remember...
- Annabelle.

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,400
You look wonderful.

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,500
You look exactly the same.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,500
This is annabelle-- What is it again?

39
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,700
Mathis.

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
I can't tell if you two know each other or not.

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
- Don draper.
- Hello.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,500
Please, mrs. Mathis, sit.

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,600
How the hell were you
in town and not look me up?

44
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,500
I wasn't sure about coming back here.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm running the company now.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
- You divorced what's-His-Name?
- No, david died,

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
And because of my father's will
The company went back to me.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,100
- Oh, i'm sorry.
- Mmm.

49
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,500
51 years old. Lung cancer.

50
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,400
That's too bad.

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,900
- So--
- So yes, if you're open to it.

52
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,100
Caldecott farms, i'm sure you've heard,

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,200
Had a public relations crisis
followed by disastrous sales.

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,100
- I hadn't heard.
- "The misfits," the movie-- Clark gable.

55
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,300
It was about horses
being turned into dog food.

56
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,700
There was an expose.

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,700
We were singled out. I don't know why.

58
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,400
You don't know why?

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,500
She owns a horse farm that makes dog food.

60
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,800
We had a 15% share of the market,

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
But now benton & bowles
has dropped us for gravy train.

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Well, that was a mistake.

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,500
Well, people eat cow,
but they call it beef.

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,300
Chicken is poultry. Pig--

65
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,600
We've got it, sweetheart.

66
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,700
Well, there is no
other word for horse-Meat.

67
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,400
I thought maybe you could invent one.

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,400
- What do you think, don?
- I think it's a tall order.

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,500
- Do you have to use horse-Meat?
- All dog food is horse-Meat.

70
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,000
People eat it all over the world.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,200
I've eaten it. It's
delicious. It's like venison.

72
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,300
I've eaten it.

73
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,900
Well, i'll tell you
what i'm telling the avenue:

74
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,200
Best idea gets my business.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,200
How long do we have?

76
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm in town until friday,
But only the big firms are rushing.

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,800
Well, i'm not gonna sit here
and brag about how big i am.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Roger.

79
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Bert.

80
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,200
I have two simple rules.

81
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,500
I don't want to change the recipe.
It's all meat.

82
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,000
And two, my father named it caldecott farms.

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,700
Don't change the name.
Don't change the product.

84
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,800
Got it.

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
Walk me out?

86
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,100
We had their business before,
But her father was a son of a bich.

87
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,500
You know, people spend more money
on dog food than baby food.

88
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,800
I'll put the fellas on it.

89
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,100
Is that really necessary?

90
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,400
You've never walked in high heels.

91
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,900
No, coming in here.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,300
What are you doing here?

93
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,300
I wanted to see you
and i need something new...

94
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,800
I'll bet you do.

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
...for my business.

96
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,000
Besides, you're married, aren't you?

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
- I am.
- Still or again?

98
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,800
You know it's again,
and don't get cute.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,500
I heard she's a teenager.

100
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Probably too jealous To let
you have a business dinner with me.

101
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,900
Gonna need a reason. 

102
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,900
Because i know you're good at this--

103
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,100
Advertising, i mean.

104
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,300
Tomorrow night. Somewhere french.

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,900
Avec plaisir.

106
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,700
All the lights were on.
I figured you'd be home.

107
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,400
I knew you were coming over,

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,900
It might be dark when i got home

109
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,600
And i didn't want the mckays
to see you turning on the lights.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,300
That's very thoughtful.

111
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm making spaghetti with cream,
butter And cheese. 

112
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
- And hot pepper?
- Yes. 

113
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,100
I had it like that in little italy.

114
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:21,300
Oh. I love that place.

115
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,700
Believe it or not,
i get treated very well there.

116
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Oh, i wish i could take you there.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,100
I know.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Don, i swear i'm not
talking about our future.

119
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,000
I entered into this with my eyes open.

120
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,600
I pushed you.

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,200
What does it matter?

122
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,500
Here we are,
And i look at your life.

123
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,100
And even if i remove
myself from the picture,

124
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,800
I see a man who is not happy.

125
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm happy now.

126
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,500
What?

127
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,500
Okay.

128
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,500
Okay.

129
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm going to lie down.

130
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,100
Come get me when you want to.

131
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,500
Why did i decide to leave surgery?

132
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,100
These last few months have been difficult,

133
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,000
But i found a reserve of strength
in myself i didn't know i had.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I realized there are other ways to
heal people Besides cutting them open.

135
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,400
What experience have you
had with psychiatry?

136
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,300
Well, that's kind of personal.

137
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,900
Greg, remember what steve said--

138
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,600
This is a field about
the most intimate details in life.

139
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,300
More intimate than their organs?

140
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,700
You know, i'm curious
why you won't answer the question.

141
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,900
What is your experience with psychiatry?

142
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,100
None personally, but my dad
had a nervous breakdown.

143
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,800
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, no one was buying furniture.

144
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,100
My mom ran away for two weeks
because he wouldn't get a christmas tree.

145
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,300
A headshrinker got him through, but
we weren't allowed to talk about it.

146
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,000
Greg, that's wonderful.

147
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,900
It was a lot of things, joan.

148
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,900
No, answer like that.
This is a talking profession.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,500
The way you just were
with me right now, So open,

150
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,900
He's gonna love you.

151
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,100
The most important thing about an interview
Is to express enthusiasm in a believable way.

152
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,400
No self-Deprecating humor.

153
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,200
You're smart. You're funny.
You're great to be around,

154
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,500
But you haven't decided
if they're the right one.

155
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,900
This isn't a beauty pageant.

156
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,300
Well, i've seen executives crash and burn.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,700
I can't believe i never told you that.

158
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,500
Hey.

159
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,000
I just...

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,300
Wanted more than i thought i would want.

161
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,100
But it'll pass.

162
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,800
Actually, i know for a fact it will.

163
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,400
I don't want it to pass.

164
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,700
One day i dropped the kids off at school
and i saw you in the yard.

165
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,400
I kept wishing for you to get in the car
And drive away with me.

166
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
Just let it go.

167
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,400
I'll clear my schedule.

168
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,000
We can go to mystic or something
for the rest of the week.

169
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,700
Mystic?

170
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,700
I can think of someplace if you're serious.

171
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,100
I am.

172
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,800
Okay.

173
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Oh, damn it.

174
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,300
- Hello.
- Roger, it's joan.

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,300
- Joan harris.
- Jesus.

176
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,700
You're lucky i answered.
Ginger's not in.

177
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,900
I know. She has a hair appointment
The last tuesday of every month.

178
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,200
She does?

179
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,000
- And i know that your lunch canceled.
- What am i wearing?

180
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
So how are things?

181
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,200
Mr. Hooker has rearranged the secretaries
In the pool alphabetically.

182
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
By cup size?

183
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,300
Well, i know where you'd be sitting.

184
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,600
You're making me sorry i called you.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,300
I need a favor.
I need help finding work.

186
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,200
- Something happen with dr. Cut up?
- Not at all.

187
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,400
He's pursuing his dream
of becoming a psychiatrist,

188
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,600
But that means more training and i just
don't want him moonlighting all the time.

189
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,700
Why does it matter?

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,700
It doesn't. None of my business.

191
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,200
- Why don't you come back here?
- Roger, i've been replaced

192
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,900
And a secretary makes less money Than
if i was working at a department store.

193
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm so glad you called me.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,800
I'm sorry it had to be for a favor.

195
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,300
No, i like that you thought of me--

196
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,100
You know, to ask.

197
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,300
You want to be on some people's minds.

198
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,800
Some people's, you don't.

199
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,200
- That's nice.
- So do you miss it here?

200
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,300
Are you asking if i miss you?

201
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,300
Well, i guess i am,
Because everything else is different.

202
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,900
- I should go.
- Well, how do i work this

203
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
If i think of anybody?
Just give them your number?

204
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Look at you, figuring
things out for yourself.

205
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,200
Bye bye, joanie.

206
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,300
Look who's here.

207
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,900
I'm sorry i missed the funeral.
My grandson was graduating.

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,500
- It was beautiful.
- Mmm.

209
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,700
Judy fixed lunch.
We don't have to talk right away.

210
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,300
I don't have a lot of time.

211
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,900
Betty wants to know
what the house is worth.

212
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,100
I'm a lawyer.
I'm not a real estate agent.

213
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,600
Well, the house was left to both of us.

214
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,900
I don't understand why i shouldn't be able To buy
it away from her at double What dad paid for it.

215
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,600
They bought it in the late '20s.

216
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,900
Dad alwa said it was the top of the market.

217
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,000
Your father intended you to get
as much money for it as you could

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,500
If you were going to sell it.

219
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Otherwise, somebody
has to buy somebody out.

220
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,000
So basically dad gave it to betty
because he knew i didn't have any money.

221
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,500
This is ugly. You know that?

222
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Milton, i need to
speak to you in confidence.

223
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
i need your advice.

224
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,000
I need complete confidentiality.

225
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,100
It's my husband.

226
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,900
I just found out
Some compromising facts.

227
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,600
He, uh--
He's been married before

228
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,600
And he--

229
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,500
Well, it's not even his real name
And he bought her a house-- His ex-Wife.

230
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,200
I-- I need to know what to do.

231
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,200
I don't know him, betsy.
I met him at your wedding.

232
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,800
I know your father
didn't want him in the will.

233
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,200
- So?
- What do you want to do?

234
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,400
Do you want a divorce?

235
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
In new york state you
need to prove adultery. Can you?

236
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,400
- Maybe.
- I mean prove it in a court of law.

237
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,900
That's hard to do. 

238
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,500
Unless he wants out,
But you're not gonna get anything.

239
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,600
You won't even be able to
buy william out of the house.

240
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,100
You'll have to sell it.

241
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,000
And he can take the children.

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,600
That's my legal advice.

243
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,500
Do you want the rest of it?

244
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,800
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

245
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,400
Is he a good provider?

246
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,800
Well, he is,
but that's not the point.

247
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
It's a lie so big, milton.

248
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,300
I feel like i've been
in some dream since i found out.

249
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,500
Just saying it out loud to you--

250
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:54,900
This is the first time
I'm realizing it's true.

251
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,600
You have three small children together.

252
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,100
At least go home, give it a try.

253
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,300
That's what i'd tell my own daughter.

254
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,600
Damn it, betts! This isn't right!

255
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,500
Look, he waited.

256
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,000
This is number three.

257
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,400
What do you want?

258
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,900
I'm going to have one
of those lovely wines.

259
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,000
Why did you have two?
Are you nervous?

260
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,400
She'll have one of those lovely wines.

261
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,500
Bordeaux.

262
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,800
Don wants to call in
a focus group right away.

263
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,100
That's enough business.

264
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,000
I want to know everything
that's happened In the last 20 years.

265
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,500
Longer.

266
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,900
It wasn't until years later

267
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:59,700
That i realized you were the only person
I could remember that time with.

268
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,100
What do you want to remember?

269
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
What i was like at that age,

270
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,300
Paris before the war,

271
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,200
Eating in cemeteries.

272
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,400
People were jumping out of
windows and we were on vacation.

273
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,300
I don't remember much.

274
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you trying to tell me when you
saw "casablanca" You didn't think about me?

275
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,800
You mean peter lorre?

276
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,200
You seemed so happy to see me
And now you're just being... drunk.

277
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Look, annabelle.

278
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,000
We were not in "casablanca."

279
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,400
The only similarity is
that you left me for another man.

280
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,500
When she gets on the plane at the end?

281
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,100
That woman got on the plane with a man
Who was going to end world war ii,

282
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,600
Not run her father's dog food company.

283
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,900
You were adrift. You didn't
do anything but spend money.

284
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You walked around like you were hoping
to be A character in somebody else's novel.

285
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,400
The boxing.

286
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,300
I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to your reasons.

287
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,100
Believe it or not,
i still remember them.

288
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,100
Oh, jesus, where's the wine?

289
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
I don't like the way
you're looking at me.

290
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,500
How am i looking at you?

291
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,800
With pity.

292
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,600
I finally found a beautiful carefree girl
Unconcerned about the future.

293
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,500
- I was more serious than you.
- Well, i got mine.

294
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,700
I married mona, joined the firm

295
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,200
And then i got shipped off to
the pacific for the duration.

296
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,400
When i came home i went to work
while you were watching "casablanca."

297
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,000
And i got blamed when we lost the account.

298
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,500
All i heard was my father said
bert cooper had a screw loose.

299
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,300
Look, you're rich.

300
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,600
Let someone else take your horse-Meat
and slap their label on it.

301
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,600
And do what?

302
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,400
- Oh, i don't want a whole bottle.
- I'll help.

303
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,100
And i told him
The closest we ever got to hemingway

304
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,500
Was sitting in a chair he once sat in.

305
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,600
And that was in the '20s, not the '30s.

306
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,100
And then he said he remembered me

307
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,800
Because i was the one Who'd
introduced him to peanut butter.

308
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,400
Yeah, i never understood that.
They had peanuts in europe.

309
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,600
No one ever thought of that?

310
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,200
- Look at us.
- Oh, will you stop?

311
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,500
Roger, do i look like a widow?

312
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,000
You look great.

313
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,100
You still want me.

314
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,000
So what?

315
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm married--

316
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Newlywed-- Honeymooning.

317
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,700
How could i have missed
the window between mona and her?

318
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
There really wasn't much of a window.

319
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
It kind of overlapped.

320
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,500
Well, i was there first.

321
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,800
We'll just take this
And tack it onto that.

322
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,700
I'm gonna get you a cab.

323
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,000
Are you afraid i'll be disappointed?
You were always good drunk.

324
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,400
Annabelle, let me get you a cab.

325
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
It's different with this girl.

326
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,100
I'm sorry.

327
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,400
Good night.

328
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,000
How'd it go?

329
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,300
I screwed up all my answers

330
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,000
And i tried to talk about the articles,
But i couldn't remember anything.

331
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,400
I made a fool out of myself.

332
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
- I am sure that's not true.
- You weren't there.

333
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,700
Stop acting like you know everything.

334
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,700
- You'll have other interviews.
- I don't want 'em.

335
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't want to be a psychiatrist.

336
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,800
It's not medicine.

337
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I might as well work at a bank.

338
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,800
I don't care what you do
as long as you do something.

339
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,000
We need money.

340
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,600
I did everything i was supposed to do,

341
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,800
Everything they told me--

342
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,000
College, med school.

343
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,100
I wanted to be a surgeon
since i was that big.

344
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,800
I'm sorry, greg.

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Maybe it's time to move on.

346
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,900
Hey, you don't know!

347
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,100
You don't know what it's like
To want something your whole life,

348
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,600
To plan for it,
to count on it and not get it!

349
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Okay?

350
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,100
Ah! Oh, shit?

351
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,900
What the hell?!

352
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,600
You're insane! You know that?!

353
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,300
Why isn't he wearing a white coat?

354
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,200
He looks like a dog-Food salesman.

355
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,000
Dogs don't like uniforms.

356
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Well, we're lucky.
Everyone has an appetite today.

357
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
They said we should bring them hungry,

358
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,900
But he does seem to like this.

359
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,400
How would you describe
your dog's temperament?

360
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,400
She's picky, and she's nervous sometimes,

361
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,000
- But she's very smart.
- And yours?

362
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,500
He's independent, you know?

363
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,900
He knows what he likes.
He's pretty hard to fool.

364
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,600
Oh my god, they're describing themselves.

365
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,700
This your first group?

366
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,600
What if i told you your dogs
were enjoying caldecott farms?

367
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,500
- What's it called?
- I wouldn't like it.

368
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,100
- Bingo, stop.
- I've never heard of it.

369
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,400
Well, you should.
They make it out of ponies.

370
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Goodness gracious. That's this one?

371
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,800
This is the first i'm hearing of this.
I wish you would've told me.

372
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,200
When people are protesting, i'm on board.

373
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, what brand does your dog prefer?

374
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,800
- Why would you do this to us?
- It's inhumane.

375
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,400
- Bingo looks sick.
- Turn it off.

376
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,200
- Could somebody get that?
- I can't turn it off.

377
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,000
- It's actually happening.
- Turn off the sound.

378
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,100
I already know how people feel.
It's your job to change that.

379
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,700
Any agency that does not change
the name is stealing your money.

380
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,800
The product is good--
It's high quality,

381
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,200
dodogs love it--
But the name has been poisoned.

382
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,100
That name got us where we are.

383
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,500
Do you think that was just luck?

384
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm not saying a new name is easy to find

385
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,400
And we will give you a lot of options,

386
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,700
But it's a label on a can.

387
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,600
It will be true, because it will promise
the quality Of the product that's inside.

388
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,900
Well, i'm going to wait it out--

389
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,800
And not for these morons, but for
another agency To solve my problem.

390
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,400
Jesus, annabelle, let it go.

391
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,800
The name is done.

392
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,400
It's unfair, but it's over.

393
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,400
- Annabelle!
- Are you ready for the next group?

394
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,600
I don't like the way
you're speaking to me.

395
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
Everybody out.

396
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,100
Is this about last night?

397
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,600
I don't even remember last night.

398
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,500
Oh, well, you threw yourself
at me and i turned you down.

399
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,600
I'm right. You want to hurt me.

400
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,700
No. No, i don't.

401
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,000
You want to know if it was a great time?

402
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,000
It was.

403
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,600
Do you want to know
if you broke my heart?

404
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,100
Obviously.

405
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,300
Well, it was a mistake.

406
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,100
It's nice to hear,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

407
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,700
It does to me.

408
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,700
When i was burying this man,

409
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,700
All i thought was i'd have rather
had My heart broken every day by you.

410
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,600
You were the one.

411
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,000
You weren't.

412
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
Well, you're lucky you found her.

413
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,800
??

414
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,900
I think it's about
four hours to norwich,

415
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,000
But the norwich inn
might be a little past it,

416
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,300
And we can check in till
midnight. We'll be fine.

417
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,000
I'll be right out.

418
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,600
Daddy?

419
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,900
I'll be right back, salamander.

420
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
Daddy!

421
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,900
I left my hat in the car.

422
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,400
Get it later.

423
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,700
I need to talk to you.

424
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,900
- Go upstairs.
- We want to say hi to daddy.

425
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,500
Upstairs.

426
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,700
You're home early.
What did william do now?

427
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,100
Not right now, don.

428
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,600
Why didn't you just call the office?

429
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,900
I came home to feed the dog
and change shirts.

430
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,600
I have a client dinner in the city.

431
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
I need to show you something.

432
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,100
- What's going on?
- Open this drawer.

433
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,900
Betts, that's my desk.

434
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Open the drawer or i will.

435
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Fine.

436
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,800
Betty, this is my desk.

437
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,300
It's private.

438
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,400
Where did you get these?

439
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,300
You left them in the pocket
of your bathrobe,

440
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,700
But i could've had a locksmith
in here anytime i wanted.

441
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I respected your privacy too long.

442
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,800
Open it.

443
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,700
No.

444
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,000
You know i know what's in there.

445
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,200
I can explain.

446
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,800
You didn't have to look at my things.

447
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
Which things, don?

448
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,800
The pictures covered with
other people's names?

449
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,100
Is that you?

450
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,100
Dick-- Is that your name?

451
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
People change their names, betts.

452
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,500
- You did.
- I did

453
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,900
I took your name.

454
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,100
And so did this anna woman,
whoever she is.

455
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,100
- I can explain.
- I know. I know you can.

456
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,100
You're a very very gifted storyteller.

457
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Betts, i--

458
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,400
I need a drink.

459
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,500
Are you thinking of what to say
or are you just looking at that door?

460
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,100
I'm not going anywhere.

461
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,500
I'll get you a drink.
Just sit down.

462
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,900
You bought her a house.

463
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,500
Where do you want me to start?

464
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,500
What's your name?

465
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,400
Donald draper...

466
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,600
But it used to be dick whitman.

467
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,800
And who's that woman?
Your other wife.

468
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,100
It wasn't...

469
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,800
Romantic.

470
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,700
I ended up married to her
Because i ran away to join the army.

471
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,200
There was an accident.

472
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,500
This guy was killed and i was injured.

473
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,700
But they made a mistake.

474
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,200
All i had to do was be him
and i could leave korea.

475
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,600
Be who?

476
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Donald draper.

477
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,600
You took his name?

478
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Yes.

479
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,300
Isn't that against the law?

480
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,500
Yes.

481
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:40,700
I found out it was easier
to be him Than to start over.

482
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,800
It turned out he was married to
that woman, so i took care of her.

483
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,700
And then i divorced her
the minute i met you.

484
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,300
You divorced her
on valentine's day, 1953--

485
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,000
Three months before we got married.

486
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,100
Why didn't you tell me?

487
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,500
Why couldn't you tell me any of this?

488
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,300
When? The day we met?

489
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,500
On our first date?
On our wedding night?

490
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,900
- Why did you need to know?
- You don't get to ask any questions.

491
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,000
You have a family.

492
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,800
No, i don't.

493
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,000
All this time i thought you were
Some football hero who hated his father.

494
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,900
I knew you were poor.

495
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
I knew you were ashamed of it.

496
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,100
I see how you are with money.
You don't understand it.

497
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,500
I was very poor.

498
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,600
Did you see her
when you were in california?

499
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
I did...

500
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,400
And she reminded me that i loved you.

501
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,300
What would you do if you were me?

502
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,600
Would you love you?

503
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,700
I was surprised that you ever loved me.

504
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
Am supposed to feel sorry for you?

505
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
I don't know.

506
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,200
You obviously wanted me to know this
Or you wouldn't have left your keys,

507
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,400
You wouldn't have kept
all of this in my house.

508
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,700
Say something.

509
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,300
I didn't think i had a choice...

510
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,900
And i don't know what the difference is.

511
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,700
This is our house
And those are our children.

512
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,500
Well, there's a big difference--

513
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,300
You lied to me every day.

514
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,900
I can't trust you.
I don't know who you are.

515
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,000
Yes, you do.

516
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,200
We're not done.

517
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,100
Betts, i'm in here.

518
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,700
How is he?

519
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,300
He kicked his blankets off.

520
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,400
Sit with me.

521
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,400
This was my father, Archibald.

522
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,100
But this--

523
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,800
That's not my mother.

524
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:19,600
My mother was a 22-Year-Old prostitute
Who died having me.

525
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,500
This woman--

526
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,600
Abigail, archie's wife--

527
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,600
She raised me.

528
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,800
When i was 10,

529
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,500
Arch died and we moved.

530
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,200
And abigail Took up with him--

531
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,700
Mack.

532
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,200
Uncle mack.

533
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,900
He was nice to me.

534
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,000
What happened to them?

535
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,100
They're all dead.

536
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,600
Even adam?

537
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,100
The little boy in all the pictures.

538
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,500
I assume he's your brother.

539
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,500
He was my half-Brother.

540
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,000
And he died.

541
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,600
He killed himself.

542
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,700
He came to me because he wanted help...

543
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,900
And i turned him away.

544
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,400
He didn't even want help.
He just--

545
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,400
He just wanted to be part of my life...

546
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,600
And i couldn't risk all of this.

547
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,400
He hung himself.

548
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,700
I'm sorry. I am.

549
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,800
Bob, how are you?

550
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,700
Listen, i've got a favor to ask you.

551
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,500
I know this girl--
Actually you met her once--

552
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,800
Joan holloway--

553
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,900
Well, harris.
Redhead.

554
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,800
Yes, she's beautiful.

555
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,100
Anyway, she's expensive, 

556
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,500
but you're always complaining About needing
someone to whip your place into shape,

557
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,900
So think about it.

558
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,500
Yeah, i want to help her out.

559
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,700
She's important to me.

560
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Oh, jane's fine. Thanks for asking.

561
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,200
Don't be a stranger.

562
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,300
I'm sorry, joanie.

563
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,600
And i'm gonna buy you
another vase to put those in.

564
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,600
I'm gonna buy you a lot of things.

565
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,300
It's not about buying things.

566
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,900
I know, i know, but i've been an ass,

567
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Feeling sorry for myself because
i couldn't solve this problem.

568
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,500
And it was so easy, joanie.

569
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,400
The answer was right in front of me.

570
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,900
I joined the army, joanie.

571
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,400
You're gonna be taken care of.
We're gonna be taken care of.

572
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,100
And the best part is
i get to be a surgeon.

573
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,400
They need them.

574
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,100
You joined the army?

575
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,800
I know i should've asked you, But i'll
do six weeks of basic training. That's it.

576
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,300
I'll do my residency in new york.

577
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,000
- And then what?
- And then i might have to go somewhere.

578
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,200
West germany, maybe vietnam
if that's still going on,

579
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,200
But a lot of docs don't have to go
anywhere, Especially if they have families.

580
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,100
And i'll go in as a captain.
Do you know what that means?

581
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,500
You don't have to work anymore.

582
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,500
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh, joanie,

583
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,200
please tell me this will make you happy,

584
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,600
Because it will make me happy
to give you everything you want.

585
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
It's wonderful, greg.

586
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,900
And no more soup.

587
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,700
Get your coat. We're going out.

588
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,900
- ??
- ???

589
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,000
Do you want something?

590
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,500
Are you gonna have something?

591
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,200
Daddy, are you going to trick or treat?

592
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,100
Yes, of course.

593
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,600
I'll see you tonight.

594
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,100
I didn't think
you were coming in today.

595
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,300
I canceled my plans.

596
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,800
Do you want me to reschedule Your lunch
with jeff stansbury at united fruit?

597
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,000
No, i have plenty to do.

598
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,100
- Hello.
- I stopped by earlier.

599
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,900
- No one answered.
- I was running all morning.

600
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,600
- About last night--
- What happened?

601
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,300
Did you get caught?

602
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,100
It's more complicated than that.

603
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,900
So i suppose i'm not
going to see you anymore?

604
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,800
Not right now.

605
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,300
No.

606
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,200
Are you okay?

607
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,100
Only you would ask about me right now.

608
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,100
Do i have to worry about my job?

609
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,900
No.

610
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,800
Okay.

611
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,900
I should go.

612
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,300
Goodbye.

613
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,700

619
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,000
Should i take the carriage
or just carry him?

620
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,300
It's cold out there.

621
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,700
You can stay here with him or i can.

622
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,400
No.

623
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,900
Good.

624
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,000
What's taking so long?

625
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,400
Trick or treat!

626
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,100
Well, hello there. Look at this.

627
