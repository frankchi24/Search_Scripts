00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,777
Previously on Mad Men:

2
00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:04,305
You don't have to answer me now,
but I wanna marry you.

3
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:07,636
Put your nose down and pay attention
to your work,

4
00:00:07,637 --> 00:00:09,586
Because there's not one thing
that you

5
00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:12,974
done here that I couldn't
live without.

6
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,361
I want...To scream at you.
For ruining all of this.

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,399
- You are very upset. I understand.
- I don't love you.

8
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:24,399
You don't owe them anything.
You should start gathering your clients.

9
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:26,589
Sometimes you're more than a son to me.

10
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:31,605
I don't think you understand.
This is regarding your contract.

11
00:00:31,606 --> 00:00:33,305
Or lack thereof.

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,695
Sign.

13
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:44,008
- Sterling Cooper is for sale.
- Why?

16
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,226
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

17
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:44,049
That's okay.
I was occupied.

18
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:46,738
- How are you today, Don?
- I'm well, Connie.

19
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,128
Thank you. How are you?

20
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:51,316
I'm afraid I have some
serious business to discuss.

21
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:52,549
Have a seat.

22
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:03,760
I was at McCann Erickson
yesterday,

23
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:08,283
and they let me know
that effective January 1,

24
00:02:08,284 --> 00:02:10,661
they're buying
Putnam, Powell & Lowe.

25
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:12,367
What?

26
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:15,714
I'm sorry, but that means
I'm going to have to

27
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,469
move my New York
properties elsewhere.

28
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,092
Why?

29
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,572
Because P.P.L. owns
Sterling Cooper.

30
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:24,342
You're all gonna
be part of McCann.

31
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:32,272
- So we're all gone.
- Sterling, I don't know.

32
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:35,295
Cooper will definitely
be put on an ice floe.

33
00:02:36,086 --> 00:02:40,323
But you're a prize pig.
You'll make more money, pick up stock.

34
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:42,629
You won't have to live
and die with every account.

35
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,060
Bulls---.

36
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,412
It's a sausage factory. I turned
them down three years ago.

37
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:51,913
This happens
all the time, Don.

38
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:53,489
It's business.

39
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,657
I'd ask them to put you
on the Caribbean hotels,

40
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:58,998
but I don't think I'm gonna
stay there much longer.

41
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,251
You come and go
as you please.

42
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:03,361
Yes, I do.

43
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:05,748
And you don't give
a crap that my future

44
00:03:05,749 --> 00:03:08,015
is tied up in this
mess because of you?

45
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:12,250
You wanted my account,
and you were lucky to get it.

46
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,113
And you wanted
to play with me--

47
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:18,959
Kick me around, knock me down to size
while you called me son.

48
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:22,722
I get it now, Connie.

49
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:24,898
It's business.

50
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,780
You know...

51
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:37,560
I got everything I have
on my own.

52
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:43,211
It's made me immune to those
who complain and cry because they can't.

53
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:48,586
I didn't take you
for one of them, Don.

54
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,498
Are you?

55
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:05,335
- Some other time we'll try again.
- Yes.

56
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,631
Have a nice holiday.

57
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:34,177
69¢ a bushel.

58
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:38,744
- That's <i>half</i> last year.
- We ain't gonna make it.

59
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:42,334
It's as fair a shake
as we could get, considering that

60
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:44,927
allotment act made
no allotment for wheat.

61
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:46,631
You were supposed
to get us a good deal.

62
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:49,021
There's a surplus.
What the hell's he supposed to do?

63
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:51,528
Well, I ain't
selling at that.

64
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:54,335
- You've got no choice.
- Sure I do.

65
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:56,843
I've got a silo.

66
00:04:57,243 --> 00:04:59,225
Store it till winter
when the price goes up.

67
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:01,728
- How you gonna pay your mortgage?
- That's none of your concern.

68
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,712
- Settle down. We're all in this together.
- No, we ain't, thanks to you.

69
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,447
I take care of mine.
You take care of yours.

70
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:12,023
Damn it, Whitman,
this is a cooperative.

71
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:13,132
No more.

72
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:18,924
Now get out
of my kitchen.

73
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:38,617
What's so urgent
that you had to wake me?

74
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:42,302
Conrad Hilton told me P.P.L. is being
sold and us along with it.

75
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,441
- So you knew about this?
- No, but it makes sense--

76
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,943
All that
short-term thinking.

77
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,520
So what do we do?

78
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:56,214
There's nothing to do.
I have a contract.

79
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:59,042
You have a contract.
Roger has a contract.

80
00:05:59,514 --> 00:06:00,730
So that's it?

81
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,484
You're losing your business
and you don't care?

82
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:07,711
- I lost my business last year.
- Well, do something about it.

83
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:13,650
If Sterling Cooper is for sale,
why don't we buy it from P.P.L.?

84
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:15,483
We could put everything
back the way it was.

85
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:16,925
Young men love risk

86
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,761
because they can't imagine
the consequences.

87
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:22,060
And you old men love
building golden tombs

88
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,171
and sealing the rest
of us in with you.

89
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:27,595
You're done.
You know that, right?

90
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,195
So I should just
throw away my fortune?

91
00:06:30,196 --> 00:06:33,406
I don't have the rest
of my life to earn it back.

92
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,073
I understand. I'll let you get
back to sleep.

93
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:37,381
Why do you care?

94
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,001
Because I'm sick

95
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:40,572
of being batted around
like a ping-pong ball.

96
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:41,775
Who the hell is
in charge?

97
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,102
A bunch of accountants
trying make $1 into $1.10?

98
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,171
I want to <i>work.</i> I want
to build something of my own.

99
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:49,041
How do you not
understand that?

100
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,939
You did it yourself
40 years ago.

101
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:52,984
That's true.

102
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:58,704
But I'm not sure you have
a stomach for the realities.

103
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,162
Try me.

104
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:05,485
Well, we're gonna
need accounts.

105
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,803
American Tobacco,

106
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:09,525
that's most of Sterling Cooper.
But that's Roger.

107
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:12,509
I understand that.

108
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:16,899
Did Hilton tell you when this
blessed event is supposed to take place?

109
00:07:17,343 --> 00:07:18,682
New Year's Day.

110
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:26,871
- We have to talk to Roger now.
- You talk to him.

111
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,471
Do you want
to do this or not?

112
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:33,063
<i>Honey.</i>

113
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:37,150
<i>Honey, he probably</i>
<i>feels bad about</i>

114
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:40,612
the president getting shot on his watch.
Now stop reading the paper.

115
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:43,043
She's obsessed.

116
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:45,908
It's the most interest that girl's
ever had in a book depository.

117
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,557
McCann is buying P.P.L.

118
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:52,830
and is absorbing Sterling Cooper
along with it.

119
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,736
What?

120
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:56,467
Conrad Hilton told me
this morning.

121
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:59,881
Christ. From one John's
bed to the next.

122
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:01,156
What a joke.

123
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:05,825
Don and I have been discussing the idea
that we buy the company back.

124
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:10,465
- Really? Why?
- Because we don't want to go to McCann.

125
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:21,536
And now you're sniffing around because
I have a golden pork chop dangling from my neck.

126
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:24,038
It's more than that.

127
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:28,130
- You know Bert's done for.
- Now it's about Bert, huh?

128
00:08:28,482 --> 00:08:30,858
I want to see what you look like
with your tail between your legs.

129
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:34,157
You sold your birthright
so you could marry that trollop.

130
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,450
Here we go.
This is your pitch?

131
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:38,816
Well, move along.

132
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:42,514
I'm not gonna throw it all away because
he doesn't want to work at McCann.

133
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:43,863
Do you want
to work there?

134
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,385
You don't value what I do
anymore than they do.

135
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:49,467
I was wrong.
I learned that with Hilton.

136
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:52,248
I can sell ideas
but I'm not an account man.

137
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:54,930
You're not good at relationships
because you don't value them.

138
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,653
I value my relationship
with you.

139
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:58,557
- You do now.
- I do.

140
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:06,854
I'm sorry.
I've got points, stock.

141
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:09,422
If I'm useless,
so be it.

142
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,606
There's a deck chair
somewhere with my name on it.

143
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,501
You're right, Roger.

144
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,735
If you've lost your appetite,
you should retire.

145
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,765
Of course, I've seen
that before, so have you.

146
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:24,668
Men my age,
even younger--

147
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,904
They play golf,

148
00:09:26,095 --> 00:09:27,685
go on vacation,

149
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:29,918
lose their appetite.

150
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:35,877
- In three years...
- Join or die?

151
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:39,653
Jesus, Bert,
he was doing better.

152
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,547
- You know it's true.
- You're still gonna outlive me.

153
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,169
We have to try.

154
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:53,488
So you do want to be
in advertising after all.

155
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:00,743
Go upstairs.

156
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:04,417
- Daddy just got home.
- I'll be up.

157
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,744
<i>Do you want me
to go too?</i>

158
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:16,313
Please sit down.

159
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,752
I made an appointment
with a divorce attorney

160
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:32,616
<i>and I suggest</i>
<i>you do the same.</i>

161
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:36,416
Come on, Betts.

162
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:40,910
- What are you doing seeing a lawyer?
- I want to be civilized about this.

163
00:10:41,914 --> 00:10:45,563
- Please don't act surprised.
- You haven't been yourself.

164
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,678
Maybe you need to see a doctor--
A good one this time.

165
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,122
Because I'd have to be
sick to want out of this?

166
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:55,778
You've had a tough
couple of weeks.

167
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,048
We all have.

168
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,094
I've had a tough <i>year.</i>

169
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:09,511
I felt I should tell you rather than just
let you get a phone call at work.

170
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,992
Well, forget it.

171
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:13,008
I'm not gonna let you
break up this family.

172
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,662
I didn't break up
this family.

173
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:37,353
Lane, please shut
the door and have a seat.

174
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:40,163
Certainly.

175
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:50,429
We know McCann Erickson
bought P.P.L.,

176
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,820
and we know that makes
Sterling Cooper chattel.

177
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,462
Who told you that?

178
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,739
Someone outside
of this building who knows.

179
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,709
Well, they're wrong.

180
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:02,214
Lane, we've worked next
to each other for a year.

181
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:05,569
Don't act like a stranger.
We've got tea.

182
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:12,290
Well, I suppose you'll
find out soon enough,

183
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,071
but your information
isn't completely correct--

184
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,291
Only Sterling Cooper
is being sold.

185
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:21,741
- P.P.L., well, will remain p.P.L.
- That doesn't change our plans.

186
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,789
We want to buy back
the company.

187
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,029
We're willing to offer
the purchase price plus 12%.

188
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:31,789
It's worth more
than that now.

189
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:35,194
- What did you get?
- I'm not going to say, but more than that.

190
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,945
I apologize you had
to find out this way.

191
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:40,297
Believe me,
it wasn't my decision.

192
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,981
I've quite
enjoyed it here.

193
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:55,540
Well, they've only
got me for a year.

194
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,132
You for what, three?

195
00:12:57,498 --> 00:12:59,123
We'll make
another run at it.

196
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,639
The only grounds for
divorce in this state

197
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,384
are absence of a spouse, incurable
insanity, life imprisonment or adultery.

198
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:10,686
Well, he hasn't
been faithful.

199
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:13,133
Do you have any witnesses
or corroboration?

200
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,186
Not really.

201
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:18,121
It wouldn't matter anyway
with both parties at fault.

202
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:23,836
- N-No. We haven't-- we aren't--
- Ken. Ken, what are you doing?

203
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,522
You think the governor needs
another scandal on the ticket?

204
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:33,039
I am sorry for presuming,
Mrs. Draper. That was wrong.

205
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:36,648
So what do I do?

206
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,110
I know it's hard
to understand,

207
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,047
but the state of New York doesn't want
<i>anyone to get divorced.</i>

208
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,008
That's why people
go to Reno.

209
00:13:43,245 --> 00:13:44,822
It's painless.

210
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,009
I met my second wife.

211
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:50,123
You stay there for six weeks
to establish residency.

212
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:54,315
Mr. Draper doesn't even need to go,
just consent.

213
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,293
I see.

214
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,423
We need to discuss what you
want in terms of settlement.

215
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:02,056
Whatever I'm entitled to.

216
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:04,744
Give us a second.

217
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:12,450
You don't need
what he can provide.

218
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:14,873
Henry, I have
three children.

219
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:17,910
I'll take care of them
and I'll take care of you.

220
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:20,697
I don't want you
owing him anything.

221
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,922
We want to get this done
as soon as possible.

222
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,073
Saint John,
I'm glad I caught you.

223
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:34,311
What is it?

224
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,706
Mr. Sterling, Cooper and Draper
have learned of the sale.

225
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:39,028
What do they know?

226
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:41,080
<i>It was a mixture of</i>
<i>truth and half truth.</i>

227
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,761
They knew about McCann,
but they were under the belief

228
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:45,559
that P.P.L.
was being sold as well.

229
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:48,152
- And what did you tell them?
- <i>That they were wrong.</i>

230
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,449
They even wanted to bid
for Sterling Cooper--

231
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,559
12% above
our purchase price.

232
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:58,497
Listen,
I apologize, lane.

233
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:01,002
Obviously the news
is getting out.

234
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:04,904
- What news?
- P.P.L. is being sold as well.

235
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:10,781
- What? Why wasn't I told?
- Didn't seem pertinent.

236
00:15:10,782 --> 00:15:13,490
Trying to keep our company
calm as well as theirs.

237
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:17,716
- Well, where's my place in this?
- With McCann, I suppose.

238
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,799
There there, lane. They know you're 
essential to the transition.

239
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,016
- And then what?
- You'll prove yourself irreplaceable.

240
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:27,422
You always do.

241
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:30,264
Lane.

242
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:33,795
Yes?

243
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,232
Don't be disheartened.

244
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,825
I'll put in
a good word for you.

245
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:42,545
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

246
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,853
We've got a month till winter,
then we'll be set.

247
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:28,781
This is what I showed
the man from the bank today.

248
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:32,091
What are they gonna do,
sell this place?

249
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,810
The bank's gonna get their
payday right after me.

250
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,905
We got nothing and we're about
to have less.

251
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:39,970
Fine!

252
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,367
I'll sell. I'll sell my crop
for nothing.

253
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:46,756
Dick.

254
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:50,760
- What are you doing?
- I'll drive it to Chicago tonight.

255
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,133
You're drunk.

256
00:16:58,561 --> 00:17:00,671
Go.
He can barely stand.

257
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,266
Calm down.

258
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:07,959
Here.

259
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:10,722
Calm down.

260
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,158
It ain't gonna rain.

261
00:17:33,057 --> 00:17:36,611
Pa! Daddy! Daddy!

262
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:13,885
Your guests have arrived.

263
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,022
Close the door.
Have a seat.

264
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,535
- What's he doing here?
- You gonna read us your will?

265
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:25,298
- I want the Cadillac.
- I couldn't sleep.

266
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:29,777
And I thought, why don't
we go to McCann directly?

267
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:31,866
Because you can't. It's done.

268
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:34,805
- You're not even gonna ask?
- I did, yesterday.

269
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,490
And you were right--
P.P.L. <i>is</i> being sold,

270
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:41,166
So it seems we're all
going to McCann.

271
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:42,849
They cut you loose.

272
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,853
I want you to find out what the price was
and give us a shot.

273
00:18:45,854 --> 00:18:47,128
Enough.

274
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:50,135
I should fire you for even trying 
to involve me in this conspiracy.

275
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:52,168
Go ahead. It's the only thing
you did well here.

276
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,446
- Don, let it go.
- I did a great many things here.

277
00:18:58,297 --> 00:19:01,619
<i>Have another. It's 9:30
for god's sake.</i>

278
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:05,336
Jes, that's right.

279
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:11,008
You have absolute authority
to fire anyone.

280
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:15,229
Fire us.

281
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:20,827
Fire us. Sever our contracts.
Let us go.

282
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:25,901
- Can you do that?
- Why would I?

283
00:19:25,923 --> 00:19:27,683
Because once this sale
goes through, 

284
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,885
you'll be thrown overboard and you'll be
a corpse knocking against their hull.

285
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,190
Nothing good ever came
from seeking revenge.

286
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:35,339
Nonsense.
We'll make you a partner.

287
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:41,858
I should think this
is worth more than that.

288
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,338
So we're negotiating.
We'll put your name on the door.

289
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:48,387
I don't know.

290
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,871
- Do you know how to do what he does?
- I don't.

291
00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:02,375
It could be done,
But getting you--

292
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:05,442
us out of here isn't
the difficult part.

293
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:09,374
- We need accounts.
- Let's say we have Lucky Strike.

294
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:14,521
And although that's, let's see,
$23 million in Billings--

295
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:15,702
24.

296
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:19,080
We'd still need another
third for cash flow.

297
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:21,814
I can't take anyone else
or Lee Garner sr.

298
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:23,157
Won't think that he's special.

299
00:20:23,158 --> 00:20:26,193
- What about Hilton?
- No.

300
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:28,459
Can we get any
of our other accounts?

301
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:29,801
We'll get them.

302
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,087
If I were to send
a telex in at noon today

303
00:20:33,088 --> 00:20:34,843
That you've all
been sacked,

304
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,721
It's after close
of business in London.

305
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:41,570
It would remain unnoticed until Monday 
morning there--2:00 A.M. here.

306
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,844
That gives us today
and the weekend

307
00:20:43,845 --> 00:20:48,142
To first gather accounts and then 
a skeleton staff to service them. 

308
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:51,038
And of course we would have
to obtain all 

309
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,734
the materials required for continuity
of service.

310
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:57,381
Obtain? We he to steal
everything.

311
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,909
Anyone approached
must be a certainty.

312
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:05,441
If news spreads,
they'll lock us out.

313
00:21:10,754 --> 00:21:12,221
Do we vote
or something?

314
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:23,045
Well, gentlemen, I suppose you're fired.

315
00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:26,845
We'll, it's official.

316
00:21:27,061 --> 00:21:29,645
Friday,
December 13th, 1963--

317
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:32,871
Four guys shot
their own legs off.

318
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:37,042
Allison,
Mr. Pryce has requested

319
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:39,747
an office-wide memo--
"the office is closed this weekend.

320
00:21:39,748 --> 00:21:42,268
"all work is suspended.
Carpet cleaning."

321
00:21:42,389 --> 00:21:45,653
- Can you get me Mr. Campbell?
- He didn't come in today. He's sick.

322
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:47,403
Call his house.
It's important.

323
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:48,920
Peggy, my office.

324
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:53,785
What do I bring?

325
00:21:58,223 --> 00:22:00,059
Shut the door.
Sit down.

326
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:08,014
I know we have to roll out
Western Union by New Year's.

327
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:10,768
I don't have art.
There's no one there.

328
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:12,420
they're selling
the company.

329
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:14,595
Again?

330
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,984
I'm starting
a new agency.

331
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:19,141
I need you here Sunday evening
to get your things

332
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:22,312
And to help us collect
whatever accounts we end up taking.

333
00:22:22,317 --> 00:22:24,101
- Really?
- Yes.

334
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:26,639
Who else is going?

335
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:30,345
Why do you need to know that?
Because it's important.

336
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:33,937
I can't tell you. Peggy, we are being
bought my McCann.

337
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:35,393
Do you know
what that means?

338
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:38,672
You just assume I'll do
whatever you say...

339
00:22:40,353 --> 00:22:43,663
Just follow you
like some nervous poodle.

340
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:47,733
- I'm not going to beg you.
- Beg me? You didn't even ask me.

341
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,922
Fine, I'm asking you.

342
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:56,423
I've had other offers,
you know,

343
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,988
that came with a sales pitch
about opportunity.

344
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:03,565
Everyone thinks
you do all my work.

345
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:06,659
Even you.

346
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,867
I don't want to make a career
out of being there

347
00:23:13,868 --> 00:23:16,235
so you can kick me
when you fail.

348
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:19,910
I guess I'll have to talk
to Kurt and Smitty.

349
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:22,009
I guess so.

350
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:38,308
- <i>Where the hell are my pajamas?</i>
- Will you please relax?

351
00:23:39,138 --> 00:23:43,238
Trudy, I called in sick today
because I had my interview with Ogilvy.

352
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:45,793
- I have to look sick.
- You do.

353
00:23:56,749 --> 00:23:58,283
What a pleasant surprise.

354
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,275
Sorry to drop in.

355
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:04,056
- <i>How are you?</i>
- <i>Better than my husband.</i>

356
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:08,129
And how are you?
We've been calling all day.

357
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,534
- <i>May I take your coats?</i>
- <i>We're fine.</i>

358
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,618
I'm going to change
the sheets.

359
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,254
- Is everything okay?
- McCann bought P.P.L. and us.

360
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:36,730
- What? Again?
- We need to talk to you.

361
00:24:36,731 --> 00:24:39,677
- It's serious.
- We're not firing you.

362
00:24:39,948 --> 00:24:43,950
Oh, am I getting a few more
adjectives added to my title?

363
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:47,661
Don't bother.
I have other plans.

364
00:24:47,662 --> 00:24:49,798
<i>Peter, may I speak</i>
<i>to you for a moment?</i>

365
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,007
Pete, we're starting
a new agency.

366
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:58,520
We're here to talk
to you about joining us.

367
00:24:59,804 --> 00:25:02,687
Wait a minute.
They're letting you go?

368
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,768
Keep it to yourself,
but I'm taking American Tobacco.

369
00:25:06,347 --> 00:25:10,845
We need another $7-$10 million
in billings for cash flow or something.

370
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,218
What do you have in
your saddlebag so far?

371
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,834
I don't have
a saddlebag.

372
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,046
I don't know what
you're talking about.

373
00:25:18,704 --> 00:25:21,773
Pete, I don't blame you for bailing out
the way you've been treated.

374
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:27,861
- So Kenny turned you down?
- We haven't spoken to Ken... yet.

375
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,110
And yes, we want your accounts,
but we also want your talent.

376
00:25:32,423 --> 00:25:37,849
- Really? And what are my talents?
- You'll do what it takes.

377
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,806
No, I want to hear it
from <i>him.</i>

378
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,857
It's not hard
for me to say, Pete.

379
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:51,784
You saw this coming,
we didn't.

380
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:56,020
<i>In fact, you've been ahead</i>
<i>on a lot of things--</i>

381
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:00,862
Aeronautics, teenagers,
the negro market.

382
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:04,728
We need you to keep us
looking <i>forward.</i>

383
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:09,129
I do, anyway.

384
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:15,819
I want to be a partner
and I want my name in the lobby.

385
00:26:18,438 --> 00:26:19,904
There's not
gonna be a lobby.

386
00:26:28,026 --> 00:26:30,701
North American Aviation,
Secor laxatives,

387
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:33,768
Gillette, Jai Alai,
maybe Pampers--

388
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,143
That's close to
$8 million already.

389
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,214
I don't think
you <i>get</i> conditions.

390
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:42,092
We'll make you a partner
if you can deliver by Sunday.

391
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:43,771
Sunday?

392
00:26:44,252 --> 00:26:46,476
We'll leave the name
and the title as a goal.

393
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:48,741
Like it or not,
that works with you.

394
00:26:50,683 --> 00:26:52,134
I'd like to say
I'll think about it,

395
00:26:52,135 --> 00:26:55,459
but I don't think
that's an option, is it?

396
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:03,872
I'm not really sick.

397
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:09,193
Welcome aboard.

398
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,498
- Good night, Trudy.
- Good night, gentlemen.

399
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:21,579
- What if I come up short?
- That's not an option.

400
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,132
Good night.

401
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,820
I want you to call
Hubert Adams as Secor.

402
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:34,666
His number's in my Rolodex.

403
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:37,758
I threw it under the bed.
Try him at home.

404
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,266
Tell him I'll meet him
at the St. Regis at 7:30

405
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,869
and sound like
a secretary.

406
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:44,079
I have to get dressed.

407
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:52,543
I can't believe
he was gonna leave.

408
00:27:52,813 --> 00:27:53,875
That little shit.

409
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:59,039
Look, they still have
a picture of Kennedy up.

410
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,484
Although, what are
they gonna do,

411
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:04,508
take it down and put
up Lyndon Johnson?

412
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:07,890
Not in this place.

413
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:12,173
I've acted like I've started
a business my whole life,

414
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:13,725
but I inherited it.

415
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:18,279
I need an attorney.

416
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:22,717
Divorce.

417
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,558
So it's true, huh?

418
00:28:27,944 --> 00:28:30,719
- What are you talking about?
- Henry Francis.

419
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:36,579
- Who?
- Jesus.

420
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:40,155
Right when things
were almost normal.

421
00:28:40,783 --> 00:28:43,382
I need you to tell me
what you know.

422
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:45,500
Margaret's friends
with his daughter.

423
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:50,014
- Are they sleeping together?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

424
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:53,791
It came
from his daughter.

425
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:56,290
He talks about her.

426
00:28:57,726 --> 00:28:59,750
<i>It sounds like</i>
<i>it's serious.</i>

427
00:29:00,748 --> 00:29:01,840
I was gonna tell you--

428
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,675
No, I wasn't.

429
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,186
I thought you <i>knew.</i>

430
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:09,044
I'm sorry I told you.

431
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,225
Believe me.

432
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:27,386
I'm sorry about that.

433
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:40,876
- Wake up.
- Shh, he's sleeping.

434
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:43,400
I don't care.
Who the hell is Henry Francis?

435
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,896
No one.

436
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:52,911
Stop it.
Stop it!

437
00:29:52,912 --> 00:29:56,229
- Who the hell is he?
- Why do you care?

438
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:59,556
Because you're good and
everyone else in the world is bad.

439
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:00,460
You're drunk.

440
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:05,312
You're so hurt, so brave with
your little white nose in the air.

441
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:07,712
All along you've been
building a life raft.

442
00:30:07,844 --> 00:30:08,907
Get out.

443
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:12,712
- You never forgave me.
- Forgave what?

444
00:30:14,472 --> 00:30:16,021
That I've never
been enough?

445
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,242
You got everything
you ever wanted-- Everything!

446
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:20,292
And you loved it.

447
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:23,313
And now I'm not good enough for
some spoiled mainline brat?

448
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:24,405
That's right!

449
00:30:26,663 --> 00:30:28,497
You won't get a nickel.

450
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:31,635
And I'll take the kids.

451
00:30:32,401 --> 00:30:34,269
God knows
they'll be better off.

452
00:30:34,643 --> 00:30:38,592
I'm going to Reno, you're going
to consent and that's the end of this.

453
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,636
Don't threaten me.
I know all about you.

454
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,192
You're a whore.

455
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,690
You know that?

456
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:12,358
I want you out
of the house.

457
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:25,886
Hold the elevator.

458
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,743
- They called you in, too?
- Yes, they did.

459
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:44,761
- I'll admit it-- I'm a little scared.
- Of what?

460
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:49,509
- Why are you here?
- I don't know.

461
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:50,627
Cooper called me.

462
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,112
First they're cleaning the carpets,
now they're not.

463
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:58,274
- Why are you here?
- Um, work.

464
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:05,465
Hey, everybody,
Harry Crane is here.

465
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:09,172
Relax, Pete,
we're expecting him.

466
00:32:09,925 --> 00:32:11,760
- What's going on?
- Why are you here?

467
00:32:13,938 --> 00:32:15,993
I'm sorry,
what's going on?

468
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:20,214
P.P.L. has been sold to McCann.
We're starting a new agency.

469
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:23,267
We'd like you to join us
as our new head of media.

470
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:28,699
- Are you kidding?
- Yes. Yes, we are.

471
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:29,876
Happy birthday.

472
00:32:31,394 --> 00:32:32,608
We need your answer.

473
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:37,449
I should really
call my wife.

474
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:39,472
Mr. Crane-- Harry,

475
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:44,158
this matter is secret
and time sensitive.

476
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,164
If you turned us down
and elect to be

477
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:51,355
a mid-level cog
at McCann Erickson,

478
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:55,967
we'll have to lock you in
the storeroom until morning.

479
00:32:57,504 --> 00:32:59,417
I'm sure you understand.

480
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:02,888
Pete.

481
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,492
We were hoping you could
decipher these job sheets.

482
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:07,234
Where exactly
are these materials?

483
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:09,326
I never look at these.

484
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,123
Can't we just
take everything?

485
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,594
<i>That's good thinking, but
we don't know where anything is.</i>

486
00:33:18,823 --> 00:33:20,829
No one knows
how this works?

487
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,815
Let me make a phone call.

488
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:25,114
- I'll take care of this.
- No. No more conspirators.

489
00:33:25,115 --> 00:33:26,358
I'll be discreet.

490
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,187
Where's Don?

491
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,675
What did we do?

492
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:41,477
Nothing.

493
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:44,513
Then why are we
in the living room?

494
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:48,719
We want to tell
you something because--

495
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:53,403
Well, it's going to be
a little bit of a change.

496
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:56,061
Your father is going
to be moving out.

497
00:33:59,524 --> 00:34:04,378
Now, we'll still be living here
and he'll come to visit.

498
00:34:06,055 --> 00:34:07,503
Then why is he going?

499
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:09,968
Because...

500
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:17,892
It'll just be temporary.

501
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,677
Like when you lived
in the hotel?

502
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:23,204
- Yes.
- It'll be different.

503
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:32,047
- Is it because I lost your cufflinks?
- No, it has nothing to do with you.

504
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:36,378
That's not what I mean.

505
00:34:40,257 --> 00:34:42,985
I love you both.
You know that.

506
00:34:43,463 --> 00:34:44,883
Then why are you going?

507
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,701
I'm not going.

508
00:34:51,102 --> 00:34:54,402
I'm just...
living elsewhere.

509
00:34:54,403 --> 00:34:57,725
That's going. You say things
and you don't mean them.

510
00:34:57,726 --> 00:35:01,133
- You can't just do that.
- Sally, sweetheart--

511
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:03,915
- Go away.
- Sally, stop it.

512
00:35:05,788 --> 00:35:07,863
You said you'd always
come home.

513
00:35:11,649 --> 00:35:12,752
I will.

514
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:16,788
It's just
a different home.

515
00:35:20,312 --> 00:35:24,789
- Will you be here for Christmas?
- You'll get to have two Christmases.

516
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,500
I only want one.

517
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:28,914
Did you make him leave?

518
00:35:30,856 --> 00:35:33,262
No. We both decided.

519
00:35:33,263 --> 00:35:36,305
You made him sleep in Gene's room,
and it's scary in there.

520
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:37,613
Listen to me,
both of you.

521
00:35:39,665 --> 00:35:40,712
I will be here.

522
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:43,856
You can call me, I will
answer and I will be here.

523
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:47,135
- Sally. Sally.
- Let her go.

524
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:51,015
Please don't go.
I don't want you to.

525
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:02,971
Nobody wants
to do this.

526
00:36:06,739 --> 00:36:08,663
I need you
to be a big boy.

527
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:35,269
- You look awful.
- Can I come in?

528
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:50,768
Do you want anything?

529
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:54,208
Yes, I do.

530
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,754
You were right.

531
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:08,341
I've taken you for granted
and I've been hard on you,

532
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:15,572
but only because I think I see you
as an extension of myself.

533
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:19,786
And you're not.

534
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,741
Well, thank you
for stopping by.

535
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:26,849
Please. Sit down.

536
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:38,819
Do you know why I don't
want to go to McCann?

537
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:41,636
Because you can't work
for anyone else.

538
00:37:43,265 --> 00:37:44,295
No.

539
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,821
Because there are people
out there who buy things,

540
00:37:50,594 --> 00:37:52,277
People like you and me,

541
00:37:54,078 --> 00:37:55,868
And something happened--

542
00:37:57,769 --> 00:37:59,743
Something terrible.

543
00:38:03,357 --> 00:38:05,755
And the way that
they saw themselves...

544
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:11,850
Is gone.

545
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:19,713
And nobody
understands that.

546
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:24,825
But you do.

547
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:31,186
And that's very valuable.

548
00:38:35,092 --> 00:38:36,279
Is it?

549
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,245
With you or without you,
I'm moving on.

550
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:48,856
And I don't know
if I can do it alone.

551
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:54,386
Will you help me?

552
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:05,545
What if I say no?

553
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,438
You'll never speak
to me again.

554
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,903
No.

555
00:39:16,904 --> 00:39:19,808
I will spend the rest of 
my life trying to hire you.

556
00:39:32,836 --> 00:39:34,867
Mrs. Harris, what a 
pleasure to see you.

557
00:39:36,493 --> 00:39:39,194
- What is she doing here?
- I said I'd be discreet.

558
00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:41,217
Tell them what to do.

559
00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:43,421
I made a list and I 
called some movers.

560
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,632
Can you read these? Do 
you know where this stuff is?

561
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,930
Yes. Of course you'll need the 
job bags on all these accounts.

562
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:51,900
We'll also need logo files,
all the film we can find

563
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:54,196
And negatives which
aren't actually here.

564
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:55,246
There you go.

565
00:39:55,247 --> 00:40:00,624
- Very good. Now I can pack.
- Sorry I'm late.

566
00:40:01,635 --> 00:40:02,681
Hi.

567
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,138
Joan.

568
00:40:05,259 --> 00:40:06,463
What a good idea.

569
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,355
Well, you're here.
Who did you bring?

570
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:13,513
North American aviation, 
Secor, Jai alai, samsonite.

571
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:16,606
- Clearasil.
- Really?

572
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:18,801
I made it.

573
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:20,868
Where do we start?

574
00:40:21,047 --> 00:40:22,995
Well, I'd start
in the art department.

575
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:24,306
It's locked.

576
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:33,389
Great.

577
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,141
I'll start
in my office..

578
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:45,727
Joanie, I can't read
your writing.

579
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:50,796
It's perfectly clear--
"correspondence.

580
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,680
Oh, I'm tired.

581
00:40:56,597 --> 00:41:00,008
- Peggy, can you get me some coffee?
- No.

582
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,504
Did you wash your hands?

583
00:41:08,412 --> 00:41:09,708
Hold the elevator.

584
00:41:12,568 --> 00:41:14,117
Greg is going to kill me.

585
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:18,098
I'm at the Roosevelt, but I'll 
need you to find me an apartment.

586
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:20,896
- Furnished?
- For the time being.

587
00:41:21,198 --> 00:41:23,872
Sorry. Good night.

588
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:32,960
Go ahead, fellas.

589
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:50,123
How long do you think it'll take 
us to be in a place like this again?

590
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:55,506
I never saw myself working
in a place like this.

591
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:13,894
Don't bother.

592
00:42:34,025 --> 00:42:35,593
We've been robbed!

593
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:40,309
He's waiting on the line.
It's his third attempt.

594
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:44,588
Saint John, how are you?

595
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:47,533
What in god's name is
going on over there?

596
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:49,878
I think at this point
it should be very clear.

597
00:42:50,856 --> 00:42:52,063
You're fired.

598
00:42:52,185 --> 00:42:54,808
You're fired for costing this 
company millions of pounds.

599
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:56,653
You're fired for insubordination!

600
00:42:56,654 --> 00:42:59,456
You're fired
for lack of character!

601
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:01,605
Very good. Happy Christmas.

602
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,996
Mr. Hooker. I've been sacked.

603
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:08,856
Please have my office and things 
put in storage at this address.

604
00:43:08,857 --> 00:43:12,969
- What's happened?
- You're a sharp boy. You'll figure 
  it out.

605
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:18,830
So let's see. I have Peggy 
and Pete sharing the desk.

606
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:20,815
Don, we'll replace
one of these couches

607
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:23,936
With a table for you, and we're 
adding two additional phone lines.

608
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:26,558
Media will be in the bedroom
with the television.

609
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:28,185
Accounts gets the bed.

610
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:31,240
And no one is to come
to this office.

611
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,562
If you have meetings,
please take them elsewhere.

612
00:43:33,563 --> 00:43:37,450
I don't want them in the 
lobby or the bar of this hotel.

613
00:43:40,045 --> 00:43:41,278
Well, look at that.

614
00:43:45,114 --> 00:43:48,675
Good morning. Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. How may I help you?

615
00:43:51,317 --> 00:43:54,218
Yes, Harry, it's room 435.

616
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:59,411
He didn't leave a note-- 
Nothing.

617
00:43:59,412 --> 00:44:00,534
Where is he?

618
00:44:00,685 --> 00:44:04,278
I just heard from John Deere--
Pete tried to poach them on Saturday.

619
00:44:04,439 --> 00:44:06,016
He must have gone with Draper.

620
00:44:15,517 --> 00:44:16,685
Damn it.

621
00:44:18,314 --> 00:44:23,397
Sure. Everything is exactly the same.
Don and I will both be on the account.

622
00:44:24,364 --> 00:44:27,203
Thanks, Bill. Okay, bye bye.

623
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:31,156
- Hello, everybody.
- Lovely, what are you doing here?

624
00:44:31,157 --> 00:44:35,317
I brought lunch. There's every 
kind of sandwich imaginable and a cake.

625
00:44:35,513 --> 00:44:36,646
Thank you, Trudy.

626
00:44:36,647 --> 00:44:39,512
- Isn't this exciting?
- It is.

627
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:43,281
This looks great, Trudy.

628
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:49,566
- There's food.
- Thank god.

629
00:45:04,761 --> 00:45:06,216
Draper residence.

630
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:10,246
It's me.

631
00:45:15,392 --> 00:45:18,248
I'm not sure where I'm staying right now,
but I'll be working out of the Pierre.

632
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:22,280
Okay.

633
00:45:26,478 --> 00:45:31,215
Listen, betts, I want you to know
I'm not going to fight you.

634
00:45:36,197 --> 00:45:37,320
Thank you.

635
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:42,852
I hope you get what 
you always wanted.

636
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:49,291
You will always be their father.

637
00:45:54,971 --> 00:45:56,046
Okay.

638
00:45:58,654 --> 00:46:02,209
Well, goodbye.

639
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,246
Goodbye.

640
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,574
You know, if you leave your shoes outside the door here, somebody polishes them.

641
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,369
Hello, don.

642
00:46:31,443 --> 00:46:32,608
How was your morning?

643
00:46:33,075 --> 00:46:34,489
Very productive.

644
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:45,823
