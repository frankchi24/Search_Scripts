1
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,188
You know how hard I've prayed?

2
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,640
Why does he make me suffer?

3
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,476
God will give you a child.

4
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,595
Let me see her.

5
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,410
So you killed another one?

6
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:26,662
'cause you had nothing to do with this.

7
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,064
Maybe you oughta stay off her once in awhile.

8
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,951
Get out you witch!

9
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,760
I've got eighty-five and my boots are off.

10
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:43,028
You don't have a sheet.

11
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,730
I'll get one...

12
00:02:44,815 --> 00:02:47,550
But that'll be another quarter

13
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,568
And this is all I have.

14
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,939
Go wash yourself.

15
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:00,196
You get me in trouble

16
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,914
And I'm gonna cut your dick off

17
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,649
And boil it in hog fat.

18
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:10,556
I'm gonna cut his dick off

19
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,526
And boil it in hog fat.

20
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,811
<i>What was that, sweetheart?</i>

21
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:17,847
I'm cold.

22
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,973
You wanna hold him?

23
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:31,494
I'm gonna cut his dick
off and boil it in hog fat.

24
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,249
It's midnight.

25
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,234
What do you want?

26
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,736
I told you god would give you a child.

27
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,727
<i>Whose is it?</i>

28
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,679
Is your husband home?

29
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,353
God is giving you a child.

30
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,259
His name is dick...

31
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,262
After a wish his mother
should've lived to see.

32
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:09,541
Come on, drink this.

33
00:05:09,626 --> 00:05:10,559
There's no point

34
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:16,282
In both of us not sleeping.

35
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,885
She wakes up at night when I drop off.

36
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,870
Are you so sure it's a girl?

37
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,156
Oh, believe me, she knows what she wants.

38
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:32,114
I packed her valise.

39
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:33,399
I could've done that.

40
00:05:33,483 --> 00:05:35,084
Well, you'll get a chance...

41
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,786
The clasp is broken.

42
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:41,724
Carla says she saw sally
hitting it with a hammer.

43
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,493
She's taken to your tools
like a little lesbian.

44
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:05,998
Am I ever going to sleep again?

45
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,068
At least you don't look tired.

46
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,588
I just want everything to be perfect.

47
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,140
I want her to come into our home at its best.

48
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,679
Close your eyes.

49
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,622
You're on a warm, sandy beach.

50
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:31,940
Because I'm a whale.

51
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,760
Shh.

52
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:40,399
You're on a warm, sandy beach...

53
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,435
You can smell the faint
scent of coconut oil...

54
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,725
And as you slide your hands

55
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,377
Through that cool patch of sand

56
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,413
Underneath that shadow
of your deck chair--

57
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,331
You're good at this.

58
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,039
Lola?

59
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,567
Lola?

60
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,069
Hello?

61
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,104
Yes, but on occasion,

62
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,305
You have to resign yourself

63
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,341
To sleeping where you are.

64
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,777
That's why they sell subway tokens, silly.

65
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:29,014
Lola.

66
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,500
You're looking lovely today.

67
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:32,651
Thank you.

68
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,019
Are you here to see me?

69
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:37,072
No, I'm just verifying some information.

70
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:41,226
Thank you, lola.

71
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,630
He just always stops by

72
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,116
Concerning the strangest things.

73
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,934
Yesterday, it was my engagement ring.

74
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,036
Enough, lola!

75
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,605
You know there's something
about the way he talks.

76
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,375
<i>I could listen to him read the phone book.</i>

77
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,743
Well, when he gets to "s",

78
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,678
I need harold sullivan at lever brothers.

79
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,370
Remarkable!

80
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,572
I picked it for its sensuality

81
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:17,246
But it also in some way
reminds me of our business.

82
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,284
<i>Who is the man who imagined her ecstasy?</i>

83
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,703
Who indeed?

84
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,708
We were just talking about you.

85
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,059
Burt's on his way.

86
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:32,728
Where's roger?

87
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,530
Probably taking another grecian treasure

88
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,782
Out of its crate!

89
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,717
I apologize for baltimore.

90
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:39,902
It has to be done.

91
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:40,919
Well, it's a sales call.

92
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:42,454
Isn't there more I can do here?

93
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,989
It's not a sales call.

94
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:47,192
You're the face of our business.

95
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,796
They need someone they can trust.

96
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,998
London fog...

97
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:55,134
How ludicrous.

98
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,718
Really, I have one.

99
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,020
So do I.

100
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:01,240
No, of course, uh, it's just the name.

101
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:03,775
There's no fog in london...

102
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,694
There is no london fog?

103
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:07,179
Are you sure about that?

104
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,347
Quite!

105
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,765
Never was.

106
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,618
It was the coal dust from the industrial era.

107
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,453
Charles dickens and what not.

108
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:15,888
<i>Mr. Cooper?</i>

109
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,157
<i>Mr. Peterson is here to see you.</i>

110
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:21,910
Good morning, burt.

111
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:22,728
Hey, don.

112
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,279
Bert.

113
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:26,231
Wayne.

114
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,701
We need you to have a seat, burt.

115
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,820
Okay.

116
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,892
You got a blindfold, too?

117
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,732
This isn't easy.

118
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,385
It really isn't.

119
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,288
Oh, god!

120
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,857
I really thought I'd made it.

121
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:54,393
I know it's unkind but it's generous

122
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,564
And it's fair.

123
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,265
So why the hell'd you wait so long?

124
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,050
It was brought to our attention

125
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,386
That your wife was undergoing radiation.

126
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,155
We thought it decent to wait.

127
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:09,091
That was decent.

128
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:11,526
Sorry I'm late!

129
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,345
Did I miss anything?

130
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:19,501
Oh, sad meeting...

131
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,437
Sorry about that.

132
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,706
Wasn't easy.

133
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,558
We'll see how you do without my rolodex.

134
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,876
We're gonna take that risk.

135
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:30,345
You make me sick!

136
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,497
You're the dying empire!

137
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:33,599
We're the future!

138
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,866
Burt, control yourself.

139
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,768
I'm the head of accounts dammit!

140
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:39,338
I'm sure we'll regret it.

141
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,056
I'm serious!

142
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:46,178
See ya on the bread lines, fellas.

143
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,567
Is that the last of it?

144
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,619
Because I don't like how much

145
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:54,803
I'm getting used to these.

146
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:59,691
I don't know anything you don't know.

147
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:00,792
Do you understand there's not point ever

148
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,177
In making over forty thousand dollars

149
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,212
When you'll be taxed 69%?

150
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,814
You're working for them!

151
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:06,832
And god forbid, you really make it...

152
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,867
Everything over seventy grand is 81%.

153
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:09,935
Even if you're married?

154
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:12,220
Fellow comrades in mediocrity,

155
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,756
<i>I want you to listen very carefully.</i>

156
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,476
You can all go straight to hell!

157
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:32,057
Heard he's going in house at nabisco.

158
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,425
<i>You're sure it's not starting again?</i>

159
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:34,776
<i>Mr. Campbell's office.</i>

160
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,062
The fire incident? What?

161
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:39,698
Mr. Campbell, mr. Price wants to see you.

162
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,635
I'm at lunch.

163
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,137
Bring your doggie bag.

164
00:11:48,157 --> 00:11:50,042
Holy crap!

165
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,279
You couldn't have pulled
me aside to say that?

166
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,781
I'm sure it's nothing.

167
00:11:55,898 --> 00:11:57,616
How the hell am I supposed to live like this?

168
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,804
Drop dead you limey vulture!

169
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,559
Son of a bitch!

170
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,047
I assume you can continue
to handle this beautifully

171
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,298
While I dispense psycho-therapy

172
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,866
To the girls in the pool?

173
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,234
<i>You americans don't know</i>

174
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,769
How to handle you're emotions...

175
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:19,538
It's unbecoming.

176
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,206
His wife is sick...

177
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,207
And if you would have talked to his girl,

178
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,558
She would have informed him.

179
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:26,428
So, he would've had a
longer walk to mr. Cooper's?

180
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:27,713
And if you would talk to me,

181
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:29,231
I would have been waiting with his coat

182
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,099
And his rolodex.

183
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,751
While we're on the topic of decorum,

184
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:33,769
I'd like to speak with you

185
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,171
About the way I'm being addressed.

186
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,006
Could you be more specific?

187
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,375
The switchboard, I'm not john.

188
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,327
I'm mr. Hooker.

189
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:43,445
That's the way they've been taught

190
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,664
To address the secretaries.

191
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:49,301
Yes, well, as I've
explained in great britain--

192
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:51,887
A truck is a laurie and
an elevator is a lift.

193
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:54,239
I've got it, mr. Hooker.

194
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,741
Despite your title...

195
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:57,325
You are not a secretary.

196
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:59,778
I'm mr. Price's right arm.

197
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,146
I'm not his typist.

198
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,180
Of course.

199
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,915
<i>Good luck everybody!</i>

200
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,951
<i>Good luck!</i>

201
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,952
I assume you will let him know

202
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,171
When mr. Peterson has left the building.

203
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:18,897
How are we today?

204
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,650
Very well--
thank you.

205
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:25,337
Burt peterson has left the agency.

206
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,571
Really?

207
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:27,923
Yes.

208
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,810
I can't speak for everyone here but, um...

209
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,479
I like you.

210
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,948
And, I like you.

211
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,017
But you don't know me.

212
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,001
But I will make that effort

213
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:41,970
If given the opportunity.

214
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:44,823
Pardon?

215
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:48,560
I apologize that I haven't
been more welcoming socially.

216
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,930
It seemed until your wife arrived...

217
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,467
I didn't want to make it
awkward with a threesome.

218
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,651
Although, now that I think of it,

219
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,036
Perhaps your being alone is all the reason

220
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:59,805
I should have offered my hospitality.

221
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,656
Do have a seat.

222
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,425
Why?

223
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:05,510
Is-is something wrong?

224
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:06,645
I don't know...

225
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,813
You just removed the head of my department,

226
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,348
Now you're offering me a chair.

227
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,517
How cruel of me.

228
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,552
I wanted to inform you

229
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:17,756
That you're now head of accounts.

230
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,307
Excuse me?

231
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:22,027
It seemed like the right thing to do

232
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:26,031
Despite your lack of hospitality.

233
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,449
The, uh, specifics are pending

234
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,085
As is the announcement.

235
00:14:30,153 --> 00:14:32,237
Is this really happening?

236
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,789
I need to know it's certain.

237
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:38,460
Yes, but, um, shh.

238
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:44,299
Wonderful!

239
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,400
Thank you.

240
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,018
Splendid.

241
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,030
Well, it turns out things are splendid.

242
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,232
That's good.

243
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,367
Could you get my wife on the phone?

244
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:23,388
<i>I have mrs. Campbell for you.</i>

245
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,310
<i>How are you, sweetheart?</i>

246
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,861
What are you doing?

247
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,046
I know, I told you this morning.

248
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,998
I'm having luncheon

249
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:35,116
With the dosins committee from the met.

250
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,701
How are they?

251
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:37,969
Since when do you care?

252
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,406
Since I was made "head of accounts."

253
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,908
Yes! No!

254
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,676
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

255
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,313
<i>It really is. Peter, that's wonderful!</i>

256
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:51,032
I knew it would happen one day for real.

257
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,151
I love the sound of your voice, right now.

258
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:54,986
That's because I'm already drunk.

259
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:56,922
Good for you!

260
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,023
Just one
more minute--

261
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,326
My husband got some good news.

262
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,944
Make a reservation.

263
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:06,331
<i>Surprise me. Okay.</i>

264
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:07,766
I should call my mother.

265
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,001
Oh, peter...

266
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,069
Don't go to the well.

267
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:14,706
There's no water there.

268
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,875
I don't even know if I'm getting a raise.

269
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,243
I didn't
ask-- I forgot!

270
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,744
That's very nobel.

271
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:22,247
You see, one doesn't need
money to be fulfilled.

272
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,598
Don't let those ladies from the met

273
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:25,784
Hear you say that.

274
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,669
I should go.

275
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,654
<i>Bye.</i>

276
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:36,261
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.

277
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:37,279
I heard you wanted to see me,

278
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,880
So I grabbed a sandwich.

279
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,335
What can I do for you?

280
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,971
Mr. Peterson's left the agency.

281
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,005
If that's your news,

282
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,673
I think you've been scooped.

283
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,175
So you've heard.

284
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,676
Let's just say, he did not go gentle

285
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,346
Into that good night.

286
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:55,397
So you're probably wondering

287
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,317
Where that leaves you.

288
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,735
Should I be worried?

289
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:03,622
No, I should say not.

290
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:07,592
We're making you head of accounts.

291
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,695
Spectacular!

292
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,280
Thanks a lot!

293
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:15,600
We're charting the course
of transition, right now.

294
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:19,838
There are many details to come.

295
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,939
I wouldn't be much an account man

296
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:23,425
If I didn't ask what it pays.

297
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,043
I wouldn't be much of a financial officer

298
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,129
If I wasn't prepared to disappoint you.

299
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,168
It's 21, but we'll reevaluate this year.

300
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,721
Ken, this is not for broadcast.

301
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,490
They'll be a formal announcement.

302
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,458
Great!

303
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,130
Can you believe this?

304
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:03,815
<i>What's the world coming to?</i>

305
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,567
<i>That is a big bottle.</i>

306
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,852
That's not a bottle that's his date.

307
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,855
<i>My-oh-my, what a
big bottle you have.</i>

308
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:13,291
I'm sorry, honey but I'm taken.

309
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,526
I just pawned my typewriter

310
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,846
So we can be together all weekend.

311
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,447
The captain's about to announce our decent

312
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:20,682
Into friendship.

313
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:21,950
Quick refill?

314
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:23,001
I don't know,

315
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,402
Need something to run the plane.

316
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:28,206
<i>And what about you, mr. Hoffstat?</i>

317
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,824
Excuse me?

318
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,543
I took a look at your luggage.

319
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,612
You're william hoffstat.

320
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,380
Uh, bill.

321
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,249
Call me bill and, uh, this is my associate,

322
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,285
Uh, mr. Fleishman.

323
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,103
S-sam.

324
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:43,655
<i>Shelly.</i>

325
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:47,826
Are you headed to baltimore or d.C.?

326
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:48,843
Baltimore.

327
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,978
Well, how 'bout that.

328
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,763
We're heading to hausner's for dinner.

329
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:52,747
We should've been in line two hours ago

330
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:54,933
If we wanted to eat by eight.

331
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,470
Lorelei has made some
inroads with the maitre d'.

332
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,471
Well, we have to check-in

333
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,456
And we have an early meeting.

334
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,774
Where you stayin'?

335
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,509
The belvedere.

336
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:10,098
Well, this is too
much-- us, too!

337
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:12,901
7:30...

338
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:14,819
It'll be a hoot and a half.

339
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,073
Now you have to take
someone else's luggage...

340
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,476
Bill hoffman's.

341
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,597
Hoffstat-- my
brother-in-law.

342
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,565
He borrowed a suitcase to go to puerto rico

343
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,200
But he never tires of putting his name

344
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,887
On other people's things.

345
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:35,323
I've flown a few times...

346
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,775
But I've never actually seen a stewardess

347
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:39,093
That game.

348
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,197
Really?

349
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,033
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

350
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,486
Hello, kenny.

351
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,438
Any plans tonight?

352
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:52,357
All I know is to avoid grand central.

353
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:54,309
I heard burt peterson's still at the bar.

354
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,729
<i>Now-now.</i>

355
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:00,698
It had to happen, I guess.

356
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,300
He didn't put up much of a fight.

357
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:04,552
Not counting today I mean.

358
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,754
It's a tough job.

359
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,673
No doubt about that.

360
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,042
I just wanna let you know,

361
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,428
I've always been a big fan of your work

362
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,315
And I've been very vocal about it.

363
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,702
I appreciate that.

364
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:42,273
Maybe now things will finally settle down.

365
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,075
That's true.

366
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:52,283
Listen, I just wanna say
that through all of this

367
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,701
I know that you were there reminding me

368
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:57,255
That I can do this job.

369
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,040
Well, you're welcome.

370
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,593
I guess it's because I think you can.

371
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,298
Have a good night. You, too!

372
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,735
And my friend and I were listening

373
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,937
To some radio program

374
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,107
And we had this huge bag of fritos.

375
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,643
Oh, we're not allowed in uniform.

376
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,845
<i>So at some point, my friend stops eating</i>

377
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,981
But I can't.

378
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:29,621
And I ate all of them and I got so...

379
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:33,808
It was quite unladylike.

380
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:36,210
And I still can't eat them to today.

381
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:39,697
Too much of a good
thing-- it happens.

382
00:21:39,782 --> 00:21:42,233
I think accounting sounds fascinating.

383
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:44,435
Going through other peoples bank accounts...

384
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,137
It sounds sexy.

385
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,872
<i>Jesus, lorelei.</i>

386
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,976
How deep did you have to
dig to come up with that?

387
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,446
Why would you insult a man's profession?

388
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:58,549
No, it's okay, uh, I
don't usually tell people

389
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,952
I'm an accountant.

390
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,621
Listen, billy, sam,

391
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,873
I didn't mean to insult your profession.

392
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:10,228
Don't sweat it.

393
00:22:10,346 --> 00:22:12,196
'course you do know there are different kinds

394
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,215
Of accountants.

395
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:17,719
Are there?

396
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:19,837
Tell them what we do.

397
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,256
I don't know, bill.

398
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,129
I'm gonna have to swear you all to secrecy.

399
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,782
You can't guarantee that.

400
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,500
You're right.

401
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,454
Well someone just brought everything

402
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,723
To a screeching halt.

403
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,758
We'll be good.

404
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,467
You ever heard of james hoffa?

405
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:51,719
You know, I don't just throw
away newspapers everyday.

406
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:54,522
I also read them.

407
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,509
There is a lot of money missing

408
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:02,046
And they don't really keep receipts.

409
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,766
So you're a couple of g-men.

410
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,251
No, we're accountants.

411
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,525
Isn't the service exquisite?

412
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,943
I'm based in new york.

413
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,211
I'd always rather be there,

414
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:23,768
But it's my job to be outta town.

415
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:26,788
<i>I don't know, I... are you a pilot?</i>

416
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,090
Keep going a lot of places andnding up

417
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,392
Somewhere I've already been.

418
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,582
<i>How 'bout a night cap?</i>

419
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,884
I don't know.

420
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:43,254
<i>You're face is red.</i>

421
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:53,231
Order for us!

422
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:18,089
Felt self-conscious there for a moment.

423
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,825
We're the only one's without a uniform.

424
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:25,680
Good night, bill.

425
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:26,948
Sam.

426
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:29,801
Shelly, it's been a swell evening.

427
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,780
Well, this is me.

428
00:24:42,865 --> 00:24:45,683
Let me see if it's different than my floor.

429
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:21,052
What are we doin'?

430
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,955
I don't know.

431
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,018
I'm engaged.

432
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:43,508
On the other hand, you
might be my last chance.

433
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,584
I've been married a long time.

434
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:57,672
You get plenty of chances.

435
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,866
It's my birthday.

436
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,637
Really?

437
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:15,306
Is it?

438
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,142
Really is.

439
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,847
Let me see your drivers license.

440
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:28,636
That's not gonna help.

441
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:32,590
Oh, happy birthday.

442
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,698
Hello?

443
00:27:13,782 --> 00:27:16,234
My air conditioner does not work.

444
00:27:16,318 --> 00:27:18,603
It is stagnant in here.

445
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:21,372
Take your hand out.

446
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,224
I can't breathe!

447
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,399
Stand up.

448
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:36,938
Lorelei thinks you look like tye power.

449
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,924
Remember him?

450
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:46,647
Go on.

451
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,575
And why you're distracted

452
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,226
I'm gonna take off my shoes.

453
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:02,013
Is that okay?

454
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:16,043
Your turn.

455
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,646
Not yet.

456
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:37,415
Do you like?

457
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,470
Everyone's always asking
me if I was a model...

458
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,672
But I wasn't.

459
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,379
The one I have at home is different.

460
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,030
Hope I didn't break it.

461
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,818
<i>Nope--
it's fine.</i>

462
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:00,705
<i>Just a minute.</i>

463
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:03,724
Hmm, thank you.

464
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,468
Airplane.

465
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:02,983
Oh, god!

466
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,048
Oh!

467
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,800
Oh, jesus!

468
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,824
Fire alarm! What is that?

469
00:30:29,644 --> 00:30:31,645
Come on, let's go!

470
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,886
Come on, forget your shoes.

471
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,787
Let's go!

472
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:42,656
Come on!

473
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,857
Come on!

474
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,300
Do you have another cigarette?

475
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:36,126
Everything's okay, folks.

476
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:57,381
Morning. Morning.

477
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,934
You ever get nervous
wearing that on the subway?

478
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,303
I don't ride the subway.

479
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,773
I do worry about being followed though.

480
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,392
I think lola takes a horse and buggy.

481
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,594
She's never on time.

482
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,463
I'm not at work yet.

483
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:13,697
I don't wanna sit in my office

484
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:16,317
And listen to someone talk
about their water retention.

485
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:19,720
Peggy, brides are very self-conscious.

486
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,572
If she's so worried about getting married,

487
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:24,575
Then why is she shamelessly
flirting with money penny

488
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,627
Don't call him that. All the time?

489
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,662
He hates that.

490
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,864
Are you defending him?

491
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:32,299
He's repellent.

492
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,202
Reminds me of a door man.

493
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,354
And the typing she does for him...

494
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:38,672
Oh, god, I'm so glad

495
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,574
I'm gonna be out of here soon.

496
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,209
That's very comforting, joan.

497
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,812
There's nothing I can do.

498
00:32:47,849 --> 00:32:49,350
Congratulations.

499
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,951
Oh, thank you.

500
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,052
Mr. Price just called.

501
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:53,420
There's a meeting for the heads of accounts

502
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:54,855
Immediately.

503
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,373
Excuse me?

504
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,275
Mr. Price called a big meeting for you

505
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,128
And mr. Cosgrove.

506
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,297
What are you talking about?

507
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,203
Whatever the circumstance
is it's nice to see you.

508
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:10,437
I'm just here to show you the continuity

509
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:12,206
Of our service.

510
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,191
That with or without burt peterson,

511
00:33:14,276 --> 00:33:16,393
You're on our mind.

512
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:24,068
I apologize.

513
00:33:24,152 --> 00:33:26,053
<i>Morris, you remember salvatore romano.</i>

514
00:33:26,154 --> 00:33:27,921
I don't know how but I left my plane ticket

515
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:28,989
At the hotel.

516
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,157
He's the guy with the marker

517
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,092
Who always does what I say.

518
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:33,761
Words, pictures.

519
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,562
Sal this is howard.

520
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,048
Pleasure.

521
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,566
I don't remember...

522
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,602
Do you have a family?

523
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,653
Uh, not yet.

524
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:44,772
I have a wife.

525
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:46,290
Well, howard is my son.

526
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:48,609
He's going to be a part of this from now on.

527
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,395
Starting with taking you
two gentlemen on a tour.

528
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:56,116
That's it?

529
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,420
You're not gonna say anything?

530
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:00,521
My father's extremely concerned

531
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,756
About the business, right now.

532
00:34:02,857 --> 00:34:04,925
What was it about our work?

533
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,628
I mean, we don't want to
take credit for everything

534
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,481
But, uh, two of every three
raincoats sold last year

535
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,966
Had london fog stitched on the inside pocket.

536
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:14,718
Dad was worried that everyone
who's ever going to buy

537
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,937
A raincoat already has one.

538
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:19,990
Because a business has to
get bigger every year...

539
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,942
That's capitalism.

540
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,682
Well, our worst fears lye in anticipation.

541
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:31,468
That's not me--
that's balzac.

542
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,986
Balzac, huh?

543
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,155
You are not burt peterson.

544
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,092
I've been investigating
umbrellas, bags, hats--

545
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,163
There are companies that
all they do is make hats.

546
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,399
London fog is a
40-year-old brand

547
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,202
That sounds like it's existed forever

548
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:49,553
And you've established with our help

549
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:52,589
That it means one
thing-- raincoats.

550
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,058
New products aside...

551
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,309
There will be fat years

552
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,511
And there will be lean years...

553
00:34:57,612 --> 00:34:59,830
But it is going to rain.

554
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:07,221
That's true.

555
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:10,324
Let's see if we can find you some ear plugs.

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,381
United fruits, warner brothers.

571
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:56,920
Why does he have utz?

572
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,272
Some of this was done based on accounts

573
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:00,958
And some of this was done
based on relationship's

574
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:03,827
And you figure out what happened with utz.

575
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,996
So you decided all of this?

576
00:36:06,147 --> 00:36:07,698
Forty-cents of every dollar at this agency

577
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:10,884
Is spent in the television
department but no-- we did.

578
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:15,389
What are these others for?

579
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,557
Olson.

580
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,591
She's all over the place.

581
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:19,076
You know that's not true.

582
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:21,979
You're each taking half the company.

583
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,166
'course it's possible someone
could distinguish themselves.

584
00:36:26,234 --> 00:36:28,852
Could be easier that way.

585
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:40,981
Can you believe this?

586
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,350
If you're upset, you seem to be hiding it.

587
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,585
I'm excited.

588
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,987
I mean, I feel badly about burt peterson.

589
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,356
Three kids, wife
with cancer--

590
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,160
But you greased up the
shoot and shoved him down it.

591
00:36:53,261 --> 00:36:55,295
What could possibly be the matter?

592
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:56,763
Why did you even accept this?

593
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:58,165
You have no interest in this.

594
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,284
Why wouldn't I want this?

595
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,103
Because you're no good.

596
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,022
They want us to hate each other.

597
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:08,091
I refuse to participate in that.

598
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,027
Very nice.

599
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,212
Very-very nice.

600
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,549
<i>Look at you, never break a sweat.</i>

601
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,717
You're right-- I
should just lay down

602
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,652
And we should run together holding hands.

603
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,072
What time is it?

604
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,441
1:15.

605
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:44,211
We should be back in the office by three.

606
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:46,680
We're going back to the office?

607
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,658
I'm gonna ask you something and I want you

608
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:00,127
To be completely honest with me.

609
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,002
London fog.

610
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:14,474
It's a subway car...

611
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:17,628
And there's a commuter looking up.

612
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:19,479
There's a girl with her back to us.

613
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:22,900
She's wearing one of those short, tan one's

614
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:24,384
But it's open.

615
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:26,803
Her legs are bare.

616
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:30,857
We know what he's seeing...

617
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:33,961
Limit your exposure.

618
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:39,900
That's it?

619
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,223
Good?

620
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,871
Mr. Hooker, may I speak with you?

621
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,462
I thought it was a good
idea that ppl had an office

622
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,364
For when visitors come.

623
00:39:10,465 --> 00:39:12,015
'course it would make since for someone

624
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,420
To be occupying it in the meantime.

625
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:18,488
I wrestled up an office for you.

626
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,341
I hope you find it
appropriate to your status.

627
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,060
My position?

628
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,879
Steer mr. Price-- not
exactly in the thick of things

629
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,065
But you will have someone
to attend to your typing

630
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,651
To avoid you siphoning off the man hours.

631
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,904
My own girl of my choosing?

632
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:36,323
I will have a lineup.

633
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:37,991
Did he take the ant farm?

634
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:39,576
No, it's actually mr. Cooper's.

635
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:42,629
Oh. It just lives there.

636
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:49,269
Hello, sweetheart.

637
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,387
Now, don't be cross.

638
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,489
I'll only be a minute.

639
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,209
You have a fever?

640
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,195
No.

641
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,969
"peter campbell, the buck stops here."

642
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,271
Huh, the buck stops here...

643
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:10,640
Unless it stops over there.

644
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,376
What's the matter?

645
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,027
There's two heads of accounts.

646
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,613
Kenny cosgrove and I are sharing it.

647
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:20,367
Oh, I'm so sorry.

648
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:23,253
I was sitting there and they just...

649
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,621
Read off a list of names.

650
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,757
A list of companies...

651
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,725
That's my life.

652
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,366
I know you won't like hearing this

653
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:41,338
But you're a lot like my father.

654
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,673
You're an ambitious man and an ambitious man

655
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,109
Is never happy with what he has.

656
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,811
Why does it always have to be like this?

657
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,697
Why can't I get anything good all at once?

658
00:40:50,832 --> 00:40:53,483
This is an amazing opportunity!

659
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:54,701
They believe in you.

660
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:56,153
Don't turn it sour.

661
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:57,304
It's a test.

662
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:00,040
Why not just cut it short
and tell them I want it.

663
00:41:00,141 --> 00:41:01,241
You can do whatever you want

664
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:04,094
But they do not want to hear your outrage.

665
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,029
They want you to beat ken.

666
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,532
I know what they want, trudy.

667
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:11,952
And honestly, I don't know...

668
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,371
I can't live with this.

669
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,495
But you'll try.

670
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,319
It's great!

671
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,238
It's a great ad!

672
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,824
So, how was everything in baltimore?

673
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,826
Out of town, don draper...

674
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,327
First class.

675
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,578
Go on.

676
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,080
Two old married men.

677
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:41,665
Oh, there was a fire in the hotel

678
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,916
Buno casualties.

679
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,384
That's too bad.

680
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,336
For casting this lucky fellow in the subway.

681
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,054
What's he look like?

682
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,725
I don't know, a little excited...

683
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:52,926
A little shocked.

684
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,261
No, what's he look like?

685
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:56,346
Oh, handsome.

686
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,104
The girl's gone.

687
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,691
I have stolichnaya
and cuban cigars--

688
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,076
Sent them from greece.

689
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,245
Should've tried a pound of opium.

690
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,750
Help yourself.

691
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:20,921
So, cosgrove versus campbell.

692
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,173
Is cooper playing god or darwin?

693
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:26,760
I know it sounds japanese
but it's not cooper.

694
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,713
What'd lane read about it
in some management book?

695
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,215
I think it came from the home office.

696
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:36,686
<i>When he told me about it,
I thought he was joking.</i>

697
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:37,804
I told him it was a stupid idea

698
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:43,643
But they don't always get our inflection.

699
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,896
Can I speak with you for a moment?

700
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,898
Come in.

701
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,203
Oh...

702
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:55,038
What?

703
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,992
I, um...

704
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,077
I just wanted to let you both know

705
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:05,415
How honored I am with this promotion.

706
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,801
Help yourself.

707
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,753
Not the stoli.

708
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,073
Hello.

709
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,976
Oh, mr. Campbell, I was going to tell don

710
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:20,564
But I can tell you myself.

711
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:22,349
I have an old pal at the mayors office

712
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,736
That wants to do a small campaign for...

713
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:31,775
I don't know, something about penn station.

714
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,912
It'd be my pleasure, bert.

715
00:43:35,997 --> 00:43:39,249
Is there any brandy?

716
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,002
<i>Any glass will do.</i>

717
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,841
I told him that despite
life under british rule,

718
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,211
We still had a real yankee.

719
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:56,800
I don't care what they say...

720
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,086
London fog is a great name.

721
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,650
I like the ants.

722
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,369
There's no shortage of distractions here.

723
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,787
Now if we can find a proper pub,

724
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:20,156
We'll have everything.

725
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:25,545
Why do you have this office?

726
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,414
I thought it was necessary
that we have a place

727
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,750
For when superior's visit.

728
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:32,385
Of course, it would make sense

729
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:34,804
For someone to occupy it in the meantime.

730
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,723
That's a hair-brained idea.

731
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,177
We just fired one-third of their workforce.

732
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:45,598
It's unseemly to go through
their pockets, as well.

733
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,319
A visitors office is good
but you sit out front.

734
00:44:49,403 --> 00:44:51,738
Of course, it was presumptuous.

735
00:44:57,345 --> 00:45:00,530
This place is a ginocracy.

736
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,999
Hadn't noticed.

737
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:08,788
My only point is if you decide
to take the train tomorrow

738
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:12,959
And you run into carlton,
I told him you were busy.

739
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,795
Our stories are straight.

740
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,048
Sally has something to tell you.

741
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,100
Sally!

742
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,602
I got it out of her.

743
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,221
Out!

744
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:33,229
Go ahead.

745
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:37,067
I'm sorry I broke your suitcase.

746
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:39,202
Find out how much it is to repair

747
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:41,154
And it'll come out of your allowance.

748
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,039
I don't have an allowance.

749
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:46,659
Then don't break things.

750
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,046
I just thought-- I just
didn't want you to go.

751
00:45:53,551 --> 00:45:57,170
Come here.

752
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,425
I will always come home.

753
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,145
You'll always be my girl.

754
00:46:19,093 --> 00:46:22,328
Your eyes look tired.

755
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,732
I don't sleep well when I'm not here.

756
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,934
You squint too much.

757
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,270
You need reading glasses.

758
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,839
Daddy-daddy!

759
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:36,459
Are these for me?

760
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,461
Yes.

761
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,181
Give me that--
it's a stick-pin.

762
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,889
There ya go.

763
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,226
Was I really in there?

764
00:46:53,294 --> 00:46:55,645
Nine months.

765
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,148
Tell me about the day I was born.

766
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:10,593
Well, it was, uh, the middle of the night...

767
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:16,099
And it was raining very hard...

768
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,654
And I had just got home from work.

769
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,614
He did not feel like
getting back in the car...

770
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:33,583
But he did.

771
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,702
I took my suitcase

772
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:36,953
And my little stuffed eeyore

773
00:47:37,037 --> 00:47:39,973
That I knew I was going to give you.

774
