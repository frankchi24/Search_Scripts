00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,501
DADDY, DON'T.

3
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:25,536
IT'S 10:30.
WHY AREN'T YOU ASLEEP?

4
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:27,668
- I'M AFRAID.
- SALLY.

5
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,204
I KNOW. YOU'RE NOT THOMAS EDISON.

6
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:29,775
I KNOW.

7
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,479
WHAT ARE
YOU AFRAID OF?

8
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,541
I'M AFRAID OF WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN

9
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:38,692
WHEN YOU TURN OFF
THE LIGHTS.

10
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:43,307
I'M HOME NOW.

11
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:47,475
NOTHING CAN HURT YOU...

12
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:51,411
EXCEPT MAYBE THIS MESS.

13
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,049
PICK UP YOUR ROOM AND
I'LL GET YOU A NIGHT LIGHT.

14
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,783
OKAY.

15
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:00,384
GO TO SLEEP.

16
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:18,334
- WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
- NOTHING.

17
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:20,192
I BET THEY'RE GONNA MAKE
US WORK OVER THE HOLIDAY.

18
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:21,926
AND COSGROVE'S LATE.

19
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:23,193
- CAN WE HAVE EVERYONE'S ATTENTION, PLEASE?
- SHH. SHH.

20
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:24,934
- CAN WE HAVE EVERYONE'S

21
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,719
<i>THIS WILL
ONLY TAKE A MOMENT</i>

22
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,919
<i>AND IT WILL NOT
BE REPEATED.</i>

23
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,320
THAT'S NOT TRUE,
MR. HOOKER.

24
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:34,731
WE'VE JUST
BEEN INFORMED

25
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,766
THAT THERE WILL BE A VISIT FROM THE
DIRECTOR AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD

26
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:39,577
<i>OF PUTNAM,
POWELL & LOWE,</i>

27
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:42,814
THE PURPOSE OF WHICH
IS BOTH FRIENDLY

28
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:47,283
AND OF COURSE
TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE.

29
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:51,604
- MR. HOOKER. - THE VISIT
WILL COMMENCE TOMORROW-

30
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,439
THAT IS TUESDAY-
AT 10:00

31
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,873
AND WILL CONTINUE
INTO THE NEXT DAY.

32
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:57,941
WE APOLOGIZE. WE REALIZE
WE WERE TO BE CLOSED

33
00:02:57,942 --> 00:03:01,212
<i>- WEDNESDAY JULY 3rd, BUT-
- Man: OH, COME ON.</i>

34
00:03:04,078 --> 00:03:06,468
THEY WERE UNAWARE
OF THE HOLIDAY.

35
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:08,275
NOW WE MERELY NEED

36
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:13,247
THAT EVERYONE CONTINUE TO OPERATE
AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR PRODUCTIVITY

37
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:16,508
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT
THEIR DESKS AND OFFICES

38
00:03:16,783 --> 00:03:19,183
ARE SHIPSHAPE
AND BRISTOL FASHION.

39
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:23,085
<i>AND BY NO MEANS SHOULD
THESE PREPARATIONS INTERFERE</i>

40
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:23,585
WITH OUR WORK TODAY.
VERY GOOD THEN.

41
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:25,036
WITH OUR WORK TODAY.

42
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,110
DON, MAY WE HAVE A WORD?

43
00:03:36,357 --> 00:03:38,157
WELL, ISN'T THIS PERFECT?

44
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,726
WELL, WE'LL JUST MOVE IT FROM
LUNCH TO THE END OF THE DAY.

45
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,461
I'M HAVING
A CAKE DELIVERED.

46
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:48,762
- HOW'S THAT GOING TO LOOK?
- A CAKE FOR WHAT?

47
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,663
TOMORROW IS JOAN'S LAST
DAY. I TOLD YOU THAT.

48
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,931
BUT IF WE'RE WORKING ON WEDNESDAY,
WOULDN'T THAT BE HER LAST DAY?

49
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,631
I DON'T KNOW
WHY SHE'D COME IN.

50
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:58,265
GREG FINDS OUT ABOUT HIS
RESIDENCY TODAY OR TOMORROW-

51
00:03:58,266 --> 00:04:00,366
I'M NOT SURE. I THINK THEY'RE
GOING AWAY TO CELEBRATE.

52
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,501
I'M GOING TO GET SOME MONEY.
WE SHOULD BUY HER SOMETHING.

53
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:04,952
UMM, HARRY AND PETE,

54
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:08,609
WE WILL NEED PRESENTATIONS
FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING

55
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:09,970
ON THE STATE
OF TELEVISION

56
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,971
AND, OF COURSE,
ACCOUNT UPDATES.

57
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:14,106
- JUST A FEW MINUTES EACH.
- ON EACH ACCOUNT?

58
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:16,273
NO, A FEW MINUTES
FOR EACH OF YOU.

59
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:17,374
AND MR. KINSEY,

60
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:20,274
<i>YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SHAVE YOUR BEARD.</i>

61
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:20,808
WHAT?! WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU PEOPLE?!

62
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:22,199
WHAT?! WHO THE HELL

63
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:24,953
THAT WAS A JOKE.

64
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:32,012
THERE'S NO NEED
FOR PANIC.

65
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:35,148
JUST THINK OF THIS AS THE
SAME AS ANY MAJOR CLIENT VISIT.

66
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,015
THEY'RE FLYING ACROSS THE OCEAN
TO HAVE THEIR KNOBS POLISHED?

67
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,526
4th OF JULY-
SUBTLE.

68
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,317
GET THE DOOR,
WILL YOU?

69
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,948
THE BRITISH ARE COMING.

70
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,624
I ASSUME YOU KNOW

71
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:55,323
I HAVE A THEORY. I BELIEVE
THEY'RE COMING TO SEE YOU.

72
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:58,757
- WHY?
- THEY'VE SHOWN A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IN YOU.

73
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:00,458
EVER SINCE YOU
SWUNG AROUND YOUR PRIVATES

74
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,192
IN THE BOARDROOM
WITH DUCK LAST YEAR.

75
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:04,326
<i>Bert: THEY STUDY
AND DISSECT YOUR WORK,</i>

76
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:06,427
TRYING TO DECIPHER

77
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:07,194
<i>WHAT IS YOUR PARTICULAR
AMERICAN GENIUS.</i>

78
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:08,895
WHAT IS YOUR PARTICULAR

79
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,762
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?
THE PRESIDENCY?

80
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:15,723
NO, I THINK IT'LL BE
A CREATIVE UMBRELLA

81
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,249
WITH A DUAL POSITION

82
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,277
- LONDON?
- BYE-BYE, DON.

83
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,790
HOW CONGENIAL
YOU TWO ARE.

84
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:30,837
I HOPE YOU CAN MAINTAIN THIS
PRETENSE WHEN THEY ARRIVE.

85
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,108
- EXCUSE ME?
- KISS AND MAKE UP

86
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,372
BEFORE YOU COST US
ALL SOMETHING.

87
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,806
BEFORE YOU COST US

88
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:37,940
YOU'RE BEING
MELODRAMATIC.

89
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:38,861
YOU'RE BEING

90
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,708
MISS BLANKENSHIP,

91
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:41,475
PLEASE MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT AT ANGELO'S

92
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:42,286
PLEASE MAKE

93
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:45,284
FOR MR. STERLING
AND DRAPER,

94
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:49,979
- THE SOONEST AVAILABLE.
- I HAVE MY OWN BARBER.

95
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,320
- THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
- ENOUGH!

96
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:54,657
EVERYONE WANTS
MARTIN & LEWIS-

97
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,349
RECONCILE.

98
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:03,114
DAMN IT!

99
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,883
IT'S DONE!
JOHN DEERE IS DONE.

100
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,960
THE 110 LAWN
AND GARDEN TRACTOR

101
00:06:19,358 --> 00:06:22,192
WITH SNOW THROWER,
TRANSPARENT VINYL ENCLOSURE

102
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:22,993
AND A KEY.

103
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,900
LOOK AT HIM. HE JUST
BROUGHT IN A MASTODON.

104
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:31,629
SORRY I'M LATE.

105
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:34,364
BIG ACCOUNTS MOVE SLOWLY,
BUT THE JOHN DEERE DOESN'T.

106
00:06:34,365 --> 00:06:35,825
LISTEN, MR. CLAMPETT.

107
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:37,797
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET YOUR
IRON HORSE OUT OF RECEPTION.

108
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,248
I WILL...
AFTER EVERYBODY SEES IT.

109
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
- NO, P.P.L. IS COMING.
- WHEN?

110
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:45,501
- TOMORROW MORNING.
- AND WE HAVE TO WORK WEDNESDAY.

111
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:49,702
- WE HAVE TO GIVE PRESENTATIONS.
- YOU GOT THAT ONE JUST IN TIME.

112
00:06:49,703 --> 00:06:51,203
YEAH, I GUESS I DID.

113
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,905
- SHE'S IN HERE!
- SHH SHH.

114
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:06,310
I'M RESTING AND YOUR LITTLE
BROTHER'S SLEEPING.

115
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:07,871
ALL HE DOES IS SLEEP.

116
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,569
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

117
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:11,913
I'M BORED.

118
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:14,947
GO BANG YOUR HEAD
AGAINST A WALL.

119
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:17,638
- MOM!
- ONLY BORING PEOPLE ARE BORED.

120
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:19,539
CAN I PET HIM?

121
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,567
DON'T WAKE HIM.

122
00:07:26,186 --> 00:07:27,286
COME OVER HERE.

123
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,253
GO PLAY.

124
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,471
YOU CAN SLEEP ALL YOU WANT,
LITTLE PIG IN A BLANKET.

125
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,458
<i>Roger: THAT IS
QUITE A SHAVE.</i>

126
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,526
<i>Roger: THAT IS</i>

127
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:51,628
I'M THINKING ABOUT
MY TOES RIGHT NOW.

128
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,599
- GO TO TOWN.
- HE'S NEXT.

129
00:07:55,498 --> 00:07:58,198
- I ALREADY HAD ONE.
- SEE, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

130
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,265
YOU THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING FEMININE ABOUT IT?

131
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:02,956
MY FATHER WAS
THE TALLEST, HANDSOMEST,

132
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:07,755
VAINEST MAN IN NEW YORK,
AND HE GOT HIS NAILS DONE.

133
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:09,503
<i>WHOO!</i>

134
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:10,836
- WHOO!

135
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,904
HE HAD HIS FOURTH CORONARY
BEHIND THE WHEEL

136
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,405
AND THEN HIT A TREE.

137
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,615
WINDSHIELD SEVERED HIS ARM

138
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,040
AND HE WAS DEAD,
SO THEY NEVER PUT IT BACK ON.

139
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,361
IN THE CASKET,
HE HAD ONE HAND-

140
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,439
THE NAILS WERE PERFECT.

141
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,976
I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT STORY.

142
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:30,167
OKAY, SO HE HIT
ANOTHER CAR AND NOT A TREE.

143
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,534
IT'S MY COMPANY.
WHY SHOULD I BE NERVOUS?

144
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:39,198
BECAUSE YOU SOLD IT.

145
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:42,115
SO THAT'S IT?
THAT'S WHAT I DID TO YOU?

146
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:44,750
I GOT YOU HALF OF A MILLION
DOLLARS? I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

147
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,021
- NO ONE SAID
YOU DID ANYTHING.

148
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:49,446
YOU SOUND
LIKE BURL IVES.

149
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:54,771
PART OF THE PROBLEM
WITH MONA

150
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:59,323
IS THAT ONE DAY SHE JUST
STARTED JUDGING PEOPLE.

151
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:00,990
NEVER GAVE
A CRAP BEFORE.

152
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,191
I'LL TELL YOU
RIGHT NOW, DON,

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,930
I DON'T LIKE
BEING JUDGED.

154
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:07,993
LISTEN, ROGER-

155
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:10,251
I'M OKAY. I'M OKAY.

156
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:15,630
WE DON'T NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

157
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:16,830
I PROMISE.

158
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:20,398
I WAS HOLDING OUT
FOR GRATITUDE,

159
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,839
BUT I'LL TAKE THAT.

160
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:23,451
THANK YOU.

161
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:29,882
WELL, MAYBE NOW YOU'LL HAVE
THE MONEY AND THE GLORY.

162
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:33,704
CALL THE PHOTOGRAPHERS,
TYPE SERVICE AND VENDORS

163
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:36,172
AND TELL THEM ALL DELIVERIES
SHOULD COME BETWEEN 9:30 AND 11:00

164
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:38,606
SO THE BRITISH CAN SEE LOTS
OF ACTIVITY WHEN THEY ARRIVE.

165
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:39,473
NOW.

166
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,374
ARE YOU BEING
SHORT WITH ME

167
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,175
BECAUSE YOU THINK
IT'LL MAKE PARTING EASIER?

168
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:45,242
MY MOTHER USED
TO DO THAT.

169
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:46,476
MY MOTHER USED

170
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,476
I'M NOTICING
FOR THE FIRST TIME

171
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:50,110
THAT THE LADIES OUT HERE
ARE RATHER PLAIN,

172
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,844
PRESENT COMPANY EXUDED.

173
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:54,112
WELL, WE COULD HIRE
SOME PROSTITUTES.

174
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:57,080
I KNOW YOUR PRIME MINISTER
ENJOYS THEIR COMPANY.

175
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:58,591
THE SECRETARY OF WAR,

176
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,715
AND YOU'D DO BEST NOT
TO BRING THAT UP TOMORROW.

177
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:02,849
- I APOLOGIZE.
- WELL, I APOLOGIZE

178
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,550
THAT TOMORROW'S VISIT WILL
STEAL FROM YOUR SPOTLIGHT.

179
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:08,318
PERHAPS WE CAN RESCHEDULE YOUR
SURPRISE PARTY TILL AFTER THE HOLIDAY?

180
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,879
WHY DID
YOU DO THAT?

181
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:10,984
DO WHAT?

182
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:13,087
MRS. HARRIS KNOWS EVERYTHING.
I'M SURE SHE WAS EXPECTING IT.

183
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:14,621
MRS. HARRIS KNOWS

184
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:19,656
I'M GOING TO GO HOME AND MAKE A
CELEBRATORY DINNER FOR MY HUSBAND.

185
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:22,490
AND WHEN YOU WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

186
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:25,571
AND WONDER WHAT YOU
FORGOT, DON'T CALL ME.

187
00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:39,114
- WELL, THAT'S SMOOTH.
- I GOT A SHAVE.

188
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,432
- WHY?
- THEY ORDERED ME TO DO IT.

189
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,667
WE HAVE AN INSPECTION
TOMORROW- THE BRITISH.

190
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:47,888
WELL, YOU LOOK
VERY SUCCESSFUL.

191
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:50,089
HOT OR COLD?

192
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:53,163
SWEDISH MEATBALLS
OR CHICKEN SALAD?

193
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:55,028
CHICKEN SALAD.

194
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,072
DID YOU PICK UP
A NIGHTLIGHT?

195
00:10:59,073 --> 00:11:01,383
I DID, AND I READ HER TO SLEEP.

196
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:04,275
SHE WAS STILL CLINGY.

197
00:11:04,342 --> 00:11:07,142
I DON'T REMEMBER HER BEING THAT
RESENTFUL WHEN BOBBY WAS BORN.

198
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:09,043
I DON'T KNOW
THAT SHE RESENTS HIM.

199
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,184
WELL, SHE WON'T
GO NEAR HIM.

200
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:12,177
SHE WON'T EVEN GO IN HIS
ROOM UNLESS I MAKE HER.

201
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,268
SHE WON'T EVEN

202
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:19,417
- WHY ARE THEY VISITING?
- WE DON'T KNOW.

203
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:22,709
DELAYED EVERYBODY'S
VACATION PLANS.

204
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,593
HE WAS PERFECT TODAY.

205
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,069
- WHO?
- GENE.

206
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:35,444
WOULD YOU EVER WANT
TO LIVE IN LONDON?

207
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:38,975
I'M SERIOUS.

208
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,540
OF COURSE.

209
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:44,378
I COULD GET A PRAM
AND A REAL NANNY.

210
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:46,996
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

211
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,192
NOTHING.

212
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:15,237
WHERE THE HELL
WERE YOU?

213
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:19,205
I TOLD YOU- I WAS GOING
FOR DRINKS WITH THE DOCS.

214
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,839
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME ANYTHING.
YOU DIDN'T CALL ME.

215
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,460
I CALLED YOU
AT WORK.

216
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,108
THAT'S A LIE.

217
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:28,146
I JUST ATE
DINNER FOR TWO.

218
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:31,351
GET OVER HERE.

219
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,140
I KNOW
YOU'RE DRUNK.

220
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,341
COME SIT
NEXT TO ME.

221
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,740
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

222
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:55,618
I, UH...

223
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:00,549
I DIDN'T GET IT.

224
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:04,058
WHAT HAPPENED?

225
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,661
IT DOESN'T SAY
ANYTHING EXCEPT

226
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:16,996
THAT THEY MADE DOUG
HUTCHINSON CHIEF RESIDENT.

227
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,837
AND I FELT THE FLOOR
OPEN UP UNDER ME.

228
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,966
SO YOU'LL GET IT
NEXT YEAR.

229
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:28,827
YOU KNEW
IT WAS POSSIBLE.

230
00:13:30,202 --> 00:13:32,202
I RAN INTO EDDINGER

231
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,903
ABOUT A HALF HOUR
BEFORE THE LETTER CAME.

232
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:36,294
I COULD TELL
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

233
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:38,941
HE WOULDN'T
LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

234
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,599
I FIGURED HE FELT BAD

235
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:46,557
AND THAT I'D AT LEAST FIND
OUT WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.

236
00:13:47,876 --> 00:13:49,943
BUT HE DIDN'T FEEL BAD.

237
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,981
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? HE LOVES YOU.

238
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:58,513
HE SAT ME DOWN
IN HIS OFFICE,

239
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,140
HE POURED A DRINK
AND HE SAID-

240
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:14,193
HE SAID I HAD
NO BRAINS IN MY FINGERS.

241
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,556
BUT HE WROTE YOU ALL
THOSE NICE EVALUATIONS.

242
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:26,047
DAMN IT, JOAN! DOCTORS DON'T
WRITE BAD THINGS ABOUT EACH OTHER.

243
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:32,727
- SO YOU'LL GO TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL.
- NOT IN NEW YORK.

244
00:14:32,728 --> 00:14:34,461
IF I WANT
TO STAY IN SURGERY,

245
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:36,902
I CAN GO TO ALABAMA
OR SOMETHING.

246
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:50,961
SO WHAT HAPPENS?

247
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:54,553
YOU'RE STILL
A DOCTOR, RIGHT?

248
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,371
I AM.

249
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,827
JUST NOT A SURGEON,

250
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:00,898
AND I WILL NEVER
BE A SURGEON.

251
00:15:05,608 --> 00:15:07,308
- DID THEY FIRE YOU?
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT, JOANIE, OKAY?

252
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,759
- DID THEY FIRE YOU?

253
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,694
I WAS HOPING
YOU WERE ASLEEP.

254
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:18,202
I HAVE ANOTHER YEAR
OF RESIDENCY.

255
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:21,571
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO LEAVE YOUR JOB.

256
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:23,382
GREG, THAT'S DONE.

257
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,019
WELL, GET ANOTHER ONE.

258
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:27,743
HONEY.

259
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:36,874
LISTEN.

260
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:40,129
YOU ARE STILL
A DOCTOR.

261
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:45,783
I MARRIED YOU FOR YOUR
HEART, NOT YOUR HANDS.

262
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:51,196
THEY ALL WENT OUT
TO CELEBRATE.

263
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:53,214
I COULDN'T DO IT.

264
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:56,975
I JUST COULDN'T DO IT.
I COULDN'T FAKE IT.

265
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,030
I'VE BEEN SITTING IN THE
DUBLIN HOUSE SINCE 2:00.

266
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,259
GO LAY DOWN.
I'LL UNDRESS YOU.

267
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,090
JUST LET ME CLOSE
THE LIGHT.

268
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,568
MR. HOOKER, YOU NEGLECTED TO TELL
ME THAT OUR GUESTS HAVE ARRIVED.

269
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:47,669
- TO WHAT DO I OWE THE PLEASURE?
- THIS IS MRS. HARRIS.

270
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,403
SHE WAS THE OFFICE MANAGER BEFORE ME,

271
00:16:49,404 --> 00:16:51,372
BUT SHE IS OFF
TO GREENER PASTURES.

272
00:16:51,373 --> 00:16:55,233
- WELL, THAT'S A SHAME. GUY MacKENDRICK.
- JOAN HARRIS.

273
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:57,516
THIS IS
MR. HAROLD FORD

274
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,611
- AND YOU RECALL SAINT JOHN POWELL.
- WE'VE SPOKEN ON THE PHONE.

275
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:04,212
I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE.
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

276
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:06,514
I MADE A RESERVATION
AT LA GRENOUILLE AT 6:00

277
00:17:06,515 --> 00:17:09,716
AND GOT YOU TWO TICKETS TO
"OLIVER." IT'S A WONDERFUL SHOW.

278
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:12,518
I'VE HEARD THAT
- A TRAGEDY WITH A HAPPY ENDING.

279
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,252
MY FAVORITE KIND.

280
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,169
THANK YOU, JOAN. SHALL I
GIVE YOU THE THREEPENNY TOUR?

281
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:24,892
<i>- PLEASE LET EVERYONE
KNOW THAT THEY'RE HERE.</i>

282
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:26,559
WE HAVE YOU
SCHEDULED TO MEET

283
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,728
WITH STERLING, COOPER AND
DRAPER AND THEN WITH MR. PRYCE.

284
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,496
<i>- THEN A LIGHT LUNCH
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM</i>

285
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:34,330
WITH THE PERSONNEL
YOU REQUESTED.

286
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:37,621
TOMORROW, THE PRESENTATIONS
AND CLIENT MEETINGS.

287
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,635
- SAINT JOHN, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- PETER CAMPBELL.

288
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:43,435
- THIS IS GUY MacKENDRICK.
- I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

289
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:44,936
YOU'RE A VERY
IMPRESSIVE FELLOW.

290
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:47,617
I WISH I COULD
RETURN THE COMPLIMENT.

291
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,169
WELL, PERHAPS
ONE DAY YOU SHALL.

292
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:57,711
GOOD MORNING,
GENTLEMEN.

293
00:17:57,878 --> 00:17:59,344
HELLO.

294
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,922
MISS OLSON,
ONE OF OUR COPYWRITERS.

295
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,081
I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. YOU
ARE A VERY IMPRESSIVE YOUNG WOMAN.

296
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:06,122
WHY THANK YOU.

297
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:08,750
I WAS JUST
WRITING COPY.

298
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,541
- AS YOU WERE.
- I HOPE WE CHAT LATER.

299
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:18,189
MR. DRAPER IS WAITING FOR
YOU IN MR. COOPER'S OFFICE.

300
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:18,880
THIS WAY.

301
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,850
THAT IS
A VERY HANDSOME MAN.

302
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,850
- GOOD TO SEE ALL OF YOU.
- IT'S A PLEASURE.

303
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:42,036
DON. NO WORSE
FOR WEAR, I SEE.

304
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,571
WHAT A DELIGHTFUL CUSTOM.
FROM THE FAR EAST I ASSUME?

305
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:46,672
- JAPAN.
- HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?

306
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:49,640
GENTLEMEN, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET HAROLD FORD

307
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:52,175
AND THIS YOUNG MAN IS
GUY MacKENDRICK.

308
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:54,510
MR. COOPER.

309
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:57,245
- MR. STERLING, WHAT AN HONOR.
- CALL ME ROGER.

310
00:18:57,246 --> 00:18:59,976
- AND YOU MUST BE DON DRAPER.
- I AM.

311
00:19:00,148 --> 00:19:02,415
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW EXCITING
IT IS TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

312
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,046
THAT'S VERY FLATTERING.

313
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,151
GUY HERE HAS DONE
A STUDY OF YOUR WORK

314
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:08,751
AND THAT'S QUITE
A COMPLIMENT.

315
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,987
YOU SEE, IN ADDITION
TO HIS INESTIMABLE CHARM,

316
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:14,655
GUY HERE HAS DEGREES
FROM CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY

317
00:19:14,656 --> 00:19:16,122
AND THE LONDON SCHOOL
OF ECONOMICS.

318
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:17,990
THREE YEARS AT THE BANK,
TWO YEARS AT McCANN

319
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,558
AND HIS MOST RECENT COUP-
MERCEDES BENZ.

320
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,327
- THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.
- I APOLOGIZE.

321
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,962
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HE WAS GOING TO RECITE

322
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:25,095
<i>MY ENTIRE
CURRICULUM VITAE.</i>

323
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:25,786
MY ENTIRE

324
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:28,834
YOU LEFT OUT "MODEST."

325
00:19:28,898 --> 00:19:31,432
WELL, WE'RE GOING
TO DEBRIEF MR. PRYCE

326
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:33,499
AND THE PLAN IS FOR YOU
TO JOIN US FOR LUNCHEON.

327
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,701
IN THE CONFERENCE
ROOM AT 1:00.

328
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:37,692
SOUNDS LIKE
AGATHA CHRISTIE.

329
00:19:38,604 --> 00:19:40,904
WELL, APPARENTLY
OUR TOUR CONTINUES.

330
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:43,505
I LOOK FORWARD TO- HOW
DO YOU SAY? - CATCHING UP.

331
00:19:43,506 --> 00:19:44,939
I AS WELL.

332
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:49,772
WELL, THAT WAS STRANGE.

333
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:54,593
LOOK AT THAT.

334
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:58,611
- THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING HIM.
- MMM.

335
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,550
<i>YES?</i>

336
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:13,239
MR. POWELL AND MR. FORD
ARE HERE TO SEE YOU.

337
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,345
- SPECTACLES.
- OH, RIGHT.

338
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,029
SEND THEM IN.

339
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:27,699
GENTLEMEN.

340
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:30,146
GREETINGS,
SAINT JOHN.

341
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,550
HAROLD,
WHAT A PLEASURE.

342
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:35,402
PLEASE SEE TO IT THAT GUY
HAS A SPACE TO PREPARE.

343
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,069
- RIGHT AWAY.
- GENTLEMEN.

344
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,870
THERE'S COFFEE
AND CAKE.

345
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:49,257
WE'RE VERY
IMPRESSED, LANE.

346
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:51,942
VERY VERY IMPRESSED
INDEED.

347
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:56,481
IN NINE MONTHS, YOU'VE
TRIMMED EVERY BIT OF EXCESS,

348
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:59,483
INCREASED BILLINGS AND WE
HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD OF COMPLAINT.

349
00:20:59,484 --> 00:20:59,983
<i>YES, WELL,
PAX ROMANA AND ALL THAT.</i>

350
00:20:59,984 --> 00:21:00,734
YES, WELL,

351
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,686
BRAVO. WE'VE DECIDED
TO OFFER YOU SOMETHING

352
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:08,421
THAT WE HOPE YOU'LL VIEW
AS A REWARD AND A CHALLENGE.

353
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:09,742
IS IT IN THE BOX?

354
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,490
IN A MANNER
OF SPEAKING.

355
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:15,825
<i>OPEN IT.</i>

356
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:24,761
OOH! WHAT IS THAT?

357
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:27,179
IT LOOKS LIKE
A SNAKE.

358
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:29,745
FANCY THAT.

359
00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:32,455
IS IT REAL?
- IT WAS.

360
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:42,141
IT'S FOR
OUR SNAKE CHARMER.

361
00:21:42,142 --> 00:21:43,309
IT'S FOR

362
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,376
WE'RE SENDING YOU
TO BOMBAY.

363
00:21:45,377 --> 00:21:45,897
BOMBAY?

364
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:48,965
WHAT WOULD I DO THERE?

365
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:52,936
WELL, HOPEFULLY THE SAME
THING YOU ACCOMPLISHED HERE.

366
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:57,634
UH, UMM...

367
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:00,792
WHERE SHALL
I PUT THIS?

368
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:13,025
I GUESS I NEEDN'T
FIND A SPOT FOR IT

369
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:16,061
- IF I'M SIMPLY MOVING AGAIN.
- DON'T POUT.

370
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:18,562
ONE OF YOUR GREATEST QUALITIES
IS YOU ALWAYS DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.

371
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:22,233
NO, IT'S JUST THE LOGISTICS
- MY WIFE JUST SETTLED,

372
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:26,400
MY SON JUST ACCEPTED TO
SCHOOL AND NOW WE'RE MOVING ON.

373
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,381
NONSENSE.
YOU'RE MOVING UP.

374
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:35,285
- MMM.
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

375
00:22:44,545 --> 00:22:46,378
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

376
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:49,447
I WILL GIVE THE FLOOR
TO GUY MacKENDRICK.

377
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:52,478
LET ME BEGIN BY OFFERING
MY WARMEST WISHES

378
00:22:52,717 --> 00:22:55,150
AND ADMIRATION FOR LANE
PRYCE AND HIS EXEMPLARY WORK.

379
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:56,985
IT'LL BE HARD
TO LOSE HIM,

380
00:22:56,986 --> 00:23:00,756
BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT
OUR LOSS IS INDIA'S GAIN.

381
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:12,860
NOW LET ME SAY THERE'S
NO CAUSE FOR ANXIETY.

382
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:16,062
THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER
REDUCTIONS IN THE RANKS.

383
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,623
YES, THAT'S GOOD NEWS

384
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:23,705
IF I MIGHT, I'D LIKE TO WALK YOU
THROUGH THIS SLIGHT REORGANIZATION.

385
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,804
<i>AS BEFORE, P.P.L. LONDON
WILL BE THE HEAD OF THIS BODY</i>

386
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:32,505
AND STERLING COOPER,
NOW MORE THAN EVER,

387
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:34,240
OUR AMERICAN PRESENCE;

388
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:37,527
<i>OUR BUSINESS MATURITY
WITH YOUR CREATIVE EDGE.</i>

389
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:41,193
A TRIUMVIRATE OF DON,
MYSELF AND MR. COOPER,

390
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:42,765
OUR CHAIRMAN EMERITUS,

391
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:46,014
WILL OVERSEE THREE
STREAMLINED DEPARTMENTS:

392
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:47,585
CREATIVE ART AND COPY,

393
00:23:49,116 --> 00:23:51,716
ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT-
THAT'S MR. COSGROVE

394
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:53,617
<i>AND MR. CAMPBELL
FOR THE PRESENT-</i>

395
00:23:53,618 --> 00:23:55,252
AND A COMBINED
TELEVISION MEDIA DEPARTMENT

396
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:56,703
HEADED BY MR. CRANE.

397
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:01,348
MR. STERLING'S NOT
ON THAT CHART AT ALL.

398
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,524
THAT'S TRUE.

399
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:07,922
OH. WELL, THAT WAS
AN OVERSIGHT.

400
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:11,661
AS YOU CAN SEE, NOTHING
MUCH HAS REALLY CHANGED.

401
00:24:11,662 --> 00:24:15,530
FRANKLY, MY PRESENCE HERE IS JUST
TO ENSURE THOROUGH COMMUNICATION,

402
00:24:15,531 --> 00:24:18,832
THAT WE HELP EACH OTHER
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE POND

403
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,923
WHETHER IT BE A SHARING
OF CREATIVE GENIUS,

404
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:25,107
MEDIA SAVVY,

405
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:30,098
OR THE UNBRIDLED ACQUISITION
OF NEW BUSINESS.

406
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:33,347
I'M SURE YOU ALL HAVE
1,000 QUESTIONS.

407
00:24:34,442 --> 00:24:37,510
BUT FOR THE TIME BEING
I SAY WE INFORM THE TROOPS

408
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:40,412
SO THAT THE TRANSITION CAN BEGIN
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE HOLIDAY.

409
00:24:40,413 --> 00:24:42,546
SHALL I HAVE
MR. HOOKER PREPARE A MEMO?

410
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,714
NO. NONSENSE. I DON'T WANT
THIS TO BE THE KIND OF PLACE

411
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,681
WHERE SUCH NEWS IS
DELIVERED THAT WAY.

412
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:47,372
SHALL WE?

413
00:24:56,021 --> 00:24:58,751
GOSH, WE'RE REALLY
GOING TO MISS YOU.

414
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,827
- WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?
- THEY REORGANIZED US

415
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:10,295
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN
THIS ROOM WHO GOT A PROMOTION.

416
00:25:10,296 --> 00:25:11,996
- REALLY?
- YES, REALLY.

417
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,670
I APOLOGIZE
FOR MY WILD IMAGINATION.

418
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,300
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

419
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,131
WHAT'S THIS?

420
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:47,387
IT'S FOR YOU.

421
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,032
"FOR MY NEW BIG SISTER,
THE BEST IN THE WORLD."

422
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:53,763
AND MY GOODNESS,
IT'S FROM BABY GENE.

423
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:57,599
LOOK.

424
00:26:06,555 --> 00:26:09,042
BABY GENE CAN'T WRITE.

425
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,790
TSK. BABIES GET
FAIRIES TO DO THINGS.

426
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:13,301
YOU KNOW THAT.

427
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,263
IT'S REALLY FROM HIM.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

428
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:20,294
I THINK
YOU SHOULD OPEN IT.

429
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:38,965
<i>- WHAT IS IT?
- IT'S A BARBIE.</i>

430
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:49,075
I THINK
HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW

431
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:51,456
THAT HE WANTS
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

432
00:26:55,908 --> 00:26:58,638
AND YOU ARE
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TOO.

433
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,391
I'M SURE YOU ALL HAVE
1,000 QUESTIONS,

434
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:27,515
BUT BEFORE I RAISE A GLASS
TO STERLING COOPER'S FUTURE,

435
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:30,136
I SHOULD LIKE
TO RECOGNIZE ITS PAST,

436
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:33,367
MOST RECENTLY,
THE INSPIRED STEWARDSHIP

437
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,786
- OF LANE PRYCE.
- HEAR HEAR!

438
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:42,062
I'M ALSO AWARE OF A RATHER
SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE.

439
00:27:43,702 --> 00:27:45,127
MRS. HARRIS,

440
00:27:45,195 --> 00:27:48,105
FROM THOSE WHO HAVE
KNOWN YOU ONLY HOURS

441
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:51,230
TO THOSE WHO HAVE CHERISHED
YOUR NEARLY 10 YEARS OF SERVICE,

442
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:52,561
I WISH YOU CAVIAR,

443
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:56,072
CHILDREN

444
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,980
AND ALL THAT IS GOOD
IN YOUR NEW LIFE.

445
00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:04,742
OH, THERE THERE.
THAT WASN'T MY INTENTION.

446
00:28:10,966 --> 00:28:12,366
MRS. HARRIS, PLEASE.

447
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,701
WE'LL HAVE OUR
PRESENTATIONS TOMORROW.

448
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,902
LET THIS AFTERNOON BE
A FETE WORTHY OF JOAN.

449
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:29,538
ENJOY THE LIQUOR
AND DELICATESSEN.

450
00:28:34,382 --> 00:28:36,006
THANK YOU.

451
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:37,113
THANK YOU ALL.

452
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:40,001
THIS IS COMPLETELY
UNNECESSARY.

453
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:42,241
YOU'LL BE
SORELY MISSED.

454
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:43,802
WE GOT YOU
THE CAKE.

455
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:47,051
WELL...

456
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,360
SO WHAT NOW? THEY KEEP
ADDING PEOPLE ABOVE US.

457
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:02,501
ONE MORE PROMOTION AND WE'RE
GOING TO BE ANSWERING PHONES.

458
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,180
WE SHOULD
GO SAY HI.

459
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,540
THIS IS
GOOD CHAMPAGNE.

460
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:17,758
I DON'T THINK SO.

461
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:22,636
I'M GOING TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

462
00:29:32,158 --> 00:29:36,358
<i>Allison: MR. DRAPER, CONRAD
HILTON'S OFFICE IS ON THE LINE.</i>

463
00:29:36,636 --> 00:29:38,228
- WHAT?
- CONRAD HILTON,

464
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:39,389
THE HOTEL OWNER.

465
00:29:40,716 --> 00:29:43,633
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT HE DOES. WHY IS HE CALLING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

466
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:47,534
- AND HE'S CALLING FOR ME?
- YES. WELL, HIS OFFICE IS.

467
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:50,101
PUT HIM THROUGH.

468
00:29:56,072 --> 00:29:57,895
DONALD DRAPER.

469
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,747
<i>Mr. Draper,
this is Miss Wakeman.</i>

470
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:03,302
<i>Mr. Hilton has expressed
a desire to meet with you.</i>

471
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,860
MAY I ASK WHAT
THIS IS REGARDING?

472
00:30:04,861 --> 00:30:06,652
<i>I just set
his schedule.</i>

473
00:30:06,653 --> 00:30:08,343
<i>When are
you available?</i>

474
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,323
<i>- HOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
- "Right now. " Please hold.</i>

475
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:13,894
- HOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

476
00:30:18,062 --> 00:30:20,548
<i>How far are you
from the Waldorf Astoria?</i>

477
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:22,108
15 MINUTES.

478
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:25,017
<i>It's the Presidential Suite.</i>

479
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:26,996
I'M ON MY WAY.

480
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,780
MMM. WHERE'S
MISS BLANKENSHIP?

481
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:45,451
SHE'S DOWN THERE
SALUTING UNION JACK.

482
00:30:45,955 --> 00:30:46,935
WHAT IS THAT?

483
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:48,844
CHOCOLATE PUDDING.

484
00:30:52,191 --> 00:30:54,014
I WASN'T EVEN
ON THE CHART.

485
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:56,445
MY NAME'S
ON THE WALL OUT THERE.

486
00:30:57,265 --> 00:30:58,895
- YOU WANT SOME?
- NO.

487
00:31:00,383 --> 00:31:03,973
I LIKE TO THINK, "I'M RICH.
THEY CAN'T HURT ME."

488
00:31:05,855 --> 00:31:07,125
THAT'S A MISTAKE.

489
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:12,635
I'M BEING PUNISHED
FOR MAKING MY JOB LOOK EASY.

490
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:16,395
ALTHOUGH
- THAT KID GUY, HE HAS A SPARK.

491
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,479
HE IS
A PURE ACCOUNT MAN.

492
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,210
AND WHAT IS
THAT JOB ALL ABOUT?

493
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:26,784
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S ABOUT
LISTENING TO PEOPLE

494
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,072
AND NEVER SAYING WHAT'S
REALLY ON YOUR MIND.

495
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:31,453
NO. IT'S ABOUT
LETTING THINGS GO

496
00:31:31,594 --> 00:31:33,794
SO YOU CAN GET
WHAT YOU WANT.

497
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,782
HAVE A NICE HOLIDAY.
ENJOY THE FIREWORKS.

498
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,530
WE TOOK THEIR MONEY.

499
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,637
WE HAVE TO DO
WHAT THEY SAY.

500
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,167
MY DAD KEEPS TALKING
ABOUT VIETNAM.

501
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:03,334
LIKE HE WANTS ME
TO GET DRAFTED.

502
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:06,469
FIRST OF ALL, THEY'RE
HARDLY DRAFTING ANYBODY.

503
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,730
SECOND OF ALL,
YOU'RE TOO OLD.

504
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:12,005
THIRD OF ALL,

505
00:32:12,073 --> 00:32:13,239
I HAVE A FRIEND
IN THE ARMY,

506
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,306
AND IF YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'RE SET.

507
00:32:15,307 --> 00:32:16,974
HE SITS BEHIND
A DESK AT FORT DIX

508
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:18,841
AND SCREWS
SECRETARIES ALL DAY.

509
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:20,762
DOES HE SHOOT
THE PEOPLES?

510
00:32:21,177 --> 00:32:23,947
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE GOTTA TAKE A PISS.

511
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:29,763
- JOAN.
- YES?

512
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:33,234
- MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU?
- THANK YOU.

513
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:39,499
I JUST
- I WANTED TO GET YOU A CARD OR A PRESENT.

514
00:32:40,452 --> 00:32:43,218
IT'D BE NICE IF I GAVE
YOU A GIFT FOR ONCE

515
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:45,319
AND YOU DIDN'T WONDER
IF I WANTED SOMETHING.

516
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,660
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

517
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:51,978
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I NEVER LISTEN TO YOU.

518
00:32:52,357 --> 00:32:54,357
IT'S JUST-
WE CAN'T ALL BE YOU.

519
00:32:54,358 --> 00:32:55,738
BE THAT AS IT MAY,

520
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:59,392
I DO TAKE SOME CREDIT
FOR YOUR SUCCESS HERE.

521
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:09,021
HEY, PUT THAT BACK.

522
00:33:10,098 --> 00:33:11,598
I'M GOING HOME!

523
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,550
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GOING TO MISS THIS!

524
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:27,205
I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

525
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,816
I REMEMBER
ON MY FIRST DAY YOU SAID

526
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,973
THAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME
IF I PLAYED MY CARDS RIGHT.

527
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:33,964
ARE YOU GETTING
SENTIMENTAL?

528
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:36,566
OH! OH MY GOD.

529
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:42,545
DON'T WORRY. I'M SURE WE'LL
SEE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

530
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:45,146
- IF WE DON'T,
I JUST HAVE TO SAY-

531
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,814
OH, FOR THE LOVE
OF CHRIST!

532
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:56,819
OH MY GOD.

533
00:33:57,886 --> 00:34:00,396
- OH, MY FOOT!
- CALL AN AMBULANCE!

534
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,240
- HOLY CRAP!
- JESUS!

535
00:34:06,924 --> 00:34:09,323
THERE'S A TOURNIQUET
IN THE FIRST AID KIT.

536
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:10,884
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

537
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:12,649
DEAR GOD.

538
00:34:15,427 --> 00:34:17,097
I CAN'T FEEL
A THING.

539
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:19,345
OH, GOD!
WHAT DID I DO?!

540
00:34:20,863 --> 00:34:20,995
<i>GET HER OUT OF HERE!</i>

541
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:22,616
- GET HER OUT OF HERE!

542
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:25,808
- THE AMBULANCE
IS ON ITS WAY.

543
00:34:38,137 --> 00:34:40,671
- I'M DONALD DRAPER.
- WE'VE MET BEFORE.

544
00:34:40,672 --> 00:34:42,872
WE HAVE,
HAVEN'T WE?

545
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,573
YELLOW ROCK
COUNTRY CLUB.

546
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:46,544
WE HAD A DRINK.
OF COURSE.

547
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:50,085
YOU FIXED IT FOR ME.
LET ME RETURN THE FAVOR.

548
00:34:50,577 --> 00:34:52,709
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE CONRAD HILTON.

549
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,677
CONNIE.

550
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:55,911
DON.

551
00:34:56,712 --> 00:34:58,412
FOOD?

552
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,013
BEST KITCHEN IN THE WORLD-
GOT A SALAD NAMED AFTER IT.

553
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:04,094
I'M FINE. I REALLY
SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.

554
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,599
I DON'T KNOW.
NOW, UH...

555
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:10,367
AFTER THIS COMES OUT

556
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:12,369
NEXT WEEK-

557
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:17,076
WELL, THEY DON'T
DO THAT FOR EVERYONE.

558
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:22,363
I THINK I LOOK
LIKE AN ARAB.

559
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,524
HOW DID
YOU FIND ME?

560
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:27,558
I CALLED AROUND, TOLD
PEOPLE I HAD A LONG CHAT

561
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,960
WITH A HANDSOME FELLA
FROM STERLING COOPER

562
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,560
AND YOUR NAME
NEVER CAME UP.

563
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:34,428
APPARENTLY YOU DON'T HAVE
LONG CHATS WITH PEOPLE.

564
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:35,639
WELL, HERE I AM.

565
00:35:36,396 --> 00:35:38,126
WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

566
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,095
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

567
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:49,301
I THINK YOU WOULDN'T BE IN THE
PRESIDENTIAL SUITE RIGHT NOW

568
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:51,042
IF YOU WORKED
FOR FREE.

569
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,000
DON, THIS IS
FRIENDLY.

570
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:57,334
CONNIE, THIS IS MY PROFESSION.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

571
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,900
I WANT YOU
TO GIVE ME ONE FOR FREE.

572
00:36:16,014 --> 00:36:20,544
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WANTS TO
THINK ABOUT A MOUSE IN A HOTEL.

573
00:36:32,021 --> 00:36:33,701
WELL, THAT WAS MY IDEA.

574
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,606
YOU GOT SOMETHING BETTER?

575
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:38,223
I MIGHT.

576
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,492
SO...

577
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,830
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

578
00:36:48,328 --> 00:36:52,388
I'M NOT GONNA LIE
- I'D LOVE A CHANCE AT YOUR BUSINESS.

579
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:54,430
OKAY...

580
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:58,698
BUT THE NEXT TIME
SOMEBODY LIKE ME ASKS YOU

581
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:00,209
A QUESTION LIKE THAT,

582
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:02,827
YOU NEED
TO THINK BIGGER.

583
00:37:06,036 --> 00:37:06,966
WELL, CONNIE,

584
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:12,705
THERE ARE SNAKES THAT
GO MONTHS WITHOUT EATING

585
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:14,373
AND THEN THEY FINALLY
CATCH SOMETHING,

586
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:15,934
BUT THEY'RE SO HUNGRY

587
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:19,261
THAT THEY SUFFOCATE
WHILE THEY'RE EATING.

588
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:23,397
ONE OPPORTUNITY
AT A TIME.

589
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:27,118
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

590
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,979
MR. DRAPER, YOU HAVE
AN EMERGENCY CALL.

591
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,947
HOME OR OFFICE?

592
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,915
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE?

593
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:36,382
- THAT WE'RE NOT TO BE TRUSTED?
- SHE'S AN IDIOT.

594
00:37:36,383 --> 00:37:38,783
- I DIDN'T KNOW SHE COULDN'T DRIVE.
- YOU TOOK THE MACHINE OUT.

595
00:37:38,784 --> 00:37:40,384
YOU HAVE TO HAVE RESPECT
FOR THAT EQUIPMENT.

596
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,251
IT'S VERY SAFE
WHEN OPERATED CORRECTLY.

597
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:44,352
WE HAD THE WORLD HANDED
TO US ON A PLATE,

598
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:46,120
AND THEN YOU SWING IN
ON A CHANDELIER,

599
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:46,387
<i>DROP YOUR PANTS
AND CRAP ON IT.</i>

600
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:47,954
DROP YOUR PANTS

601
00:37:48,022 --> 00:37:50,656
JESUS, IT'S LIKE
IWO JIMA OUT THERE.

602
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:53,490
WE SHOULD PUT A RUBBER MAT
DOWN SO COOPER CAN GET AROUND.

603
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:54,757
THEY'RE CHANGING
THE CARPETING.

604
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:55,448
ANY NEWS?

605
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,325
HE MIGHT LOSE
HIS FOOT.

606
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:00,883
RIGHT WHEN HE GOT IT
IN THE DOOR.

607
00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:04,599
OH GOD.

608
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:08,396
SIT DOWN, SISSY MARY.
YOU'RE PALE.

609
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:12,395
I TAKE
FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

610
00:38:12,866 --> 00:38:14,999
BELIEVE ME,
SOMEWHERE IN THIS BUSINESS,

611
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,810
THIS HAS
HAPPENED BEFORE.

612
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:22,375
HAPPENED BEFORE.

613
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,980
JOAN- MY GOD.

614
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:37,519
I KNOW.
IT'S RUINED.

615
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,112
- HOW IS HE?
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO COME OVER.

616
00:38:40,113 --> 00:38:41,443
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

617
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,071
HONESTLY, WHEN I CALLED YOU,
I THOUGHT HE MIGHT DIE.

618
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,833
- BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO?
- MMM.

619
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,624
NO. HE'S LOST
THE FOOT.

620
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,139
JESUS.
THAT'S AWFUL.

621
00:38:50,758 --> 00:38:53,218
LANE WENT TO RETRIEVE
POWE AND FORD FROM DINNER.

622
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:55,899
THEY'VE ALREADY TALKED
TO THE DOCTOR.

623
00:38:57,244 --> 00:38:58,440
I'LL WAIT.

624
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,893
DESPITE
THE CIRCUS TODAY,

625
00:39:12,943 --> 00:39:16,070
I HOPE YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE
GOING TO BE TERRIBLY MISSED.

626
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:17,571
THAT'S NICE TO HEAR,

627
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:20,342
ESPECIALLY
FROM YOU, DON.

628
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:36,169
I BET HE FELT GREAT WHEN
HE WOKE UP THIS MORNING.

629
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,022
I'M SURE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

630
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:42,061
BUT THAT'S LIFE.

631
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,107
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE
ON TOP OF THE WORLD,

632
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:50,008
THE NEXT MINUTE SOME SECRETARY IS
RUNNING YOU OVER WITH A LAWN MOWER.

633
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,320
<i>Lane: OH!</i>

634
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:58,696
- I'M HEARTBROKEN.
- IT'S A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

635
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:01,039
ONE THAT SURELY
COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED,

636
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,568
ALTHOUGH, MRS. HARRIS, THANK
YOU FOR YOUR QUICK THINKING.

637
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:06,329
- YOU MAY HAVE SAVED HIS LIFE.
- SUCH AS IT IS.

638
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,180
HE WAS A GREAT ACCOUNT MAN
- A PRODIGY.

639
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:12,948
HE COULD TALK A SCOTSMAN
OUT OF A PENNY.

640
00:40:13,148 --> 00:40:14,648
NOW THAT'S ALL OVER.

641
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,338
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S TRUE.

642
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:19,234
THE MAN IS
MISSING A FOOT.

643
00:40:19,235 --> 00:40:21,463
HOW IS HE GOING
TO WORK? HE CAN'T WALK.

644
00:40:21,464 --> 00:40:23,891
THE DOCTOR SAID
HE'LL NEVER GOLF AGAIN.

645
00:40:23,892 --> 00:40:27,682
I'M AFRAID WE HAVE TO
REEVALUATE OUR ENTIRE STRATEGY.

646
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:31,275
LANE WILL REMAIN
HERE INDEFINITELY.

647
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:34,235
WE'LL CLOSE THE OFFICE
TOMORROW, OBVIOUSLY.

648
00:40:34,236 --> 00:40:35,733
MRS. HARRIS,
PLEASE ALLOW THE COMPANY

649
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,229
TO REIMBURSE YOU
FOR THAT DRESS,

650
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,092
JUST AS A TOKEN
OF OUR GRATITUDE.

651
00:40:39,093 --> 00:40:41,320
I THINK SAINT JOHN AND I
SHOULD SEE HIM IF WE CAN.

652
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:42,071
OF COURSE.

653
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:54,326
YOU SHOULD GET HOME
TO THAT LUCKY HUSBAND.

654
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:54,759
YES.

655
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,197
HUH.

656
00:41:21,735 --> 00:41:23,115
CAN I GET YOU ONE?

657
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,561
SURE.

658
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:34,466
I'VE BEEN READING A LOT OF
AMERICAN LITERATURE LATELY.

659
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:40,854
- "TOM SAWYER."
- THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

660
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:44,852
I FEEL LIKE I JUST WENT
TO MY OWN FUNERAL.

661
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:47,945
I DIDN'T LIKE
THE EULOGY.

662
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:49,025
- HEY. HEY HEY HEY HEY. HEY HEY.
- DADDY!

663
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:51,575
<i>HEY. I'VE GOT YOU.</i>

664
00:42:51,643 --> 00:42:53,439
I'VE GOT YOU.
JUST BREATHE.

665
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,780
SHH.

666
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,660
SHH.

667
00:43:00,923 --> 00:43:02,313
GET HIM OUT, DADDY!

668
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:08,289
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

669
00:43:12,332 --> 00:43:12,672
SHH.

670
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:15,704
- DADDY.
- SHH.

671
00:43:21,313 --> 00:43:22,875
OKAY, CALM DOWN

672
00:43:22,943 --> 00:43:25,083
AND TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

673
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:26,568
GRANDPA GENE-

674
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,661
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE ANYMORE.

675
00:43:29,662 --> 00:43:32,388
- HE'S NOT.
- HE'S CALLED GENE,

676
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:35,416
HE SLEEPS IN HIS ROOM,
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE HIM

677
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:37,046
AND I BET WHEN
HE STARTS TALKING

678
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,657
HE'S GONNA SOUND
JUST LIKE HIM TOO.

679
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:42,712
HE'S A BABY.
THAT'S IT.

680
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,211
I WANT YOU
TO GO TO SLEEP.

681
00:43:49,353 --> 00:43:51,733
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS GHOSTS.

682
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:12,308
BETTS,
THIS HAS TO STOP.

683
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:14,348
THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

684
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:16,428
SHE'S JEALOUS
OF HER LITTLE BROTHER.

685
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:18,524
NO, SHE'S NOT JEALOUS.
SHE'S SCARED,

686
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:20,020
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE
HE HAS THAT NAME.

687
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:22,581
"THAT NAME."
YOU'VE NEVER LIKED IT,

688
00:44:22,915 --> 00:44:24,777
<i>YOU HAVEN'T HIDDEN IT WELL AND
NOW YOU'RE BRINGING HER INTO THIS.</i>

689
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:27,771
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
LET'S TALK ABOUT SALLY.

690
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:30,165
SHE'S A CHILD.
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

691
00:44:30,166 --> 00:44:31,376
<i>NOW YOU HAVE TO.</i>

692
00:44:32,062 --> 00:44:34,290
HE WAS MY FATHER
AND THAT WAS HIS NAME.

693
00:44:34,291 --> 00:44:36,201
IT'S WHAT
PEOPLE DO, DON.

694
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:39,013
IT'S HOW THEY KEEP
THE MEMORY ALIVE.

695
00:44:39,014 --> 00:44:41,154
HE HATED ME
AND I HATED HIM.

696
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:44,292
- THAT'S THE MEMORY.
- THAT'S HIS NAME.

697
00:44:49,658 --> 00:44:50,928
I'M REALLY SORRY.

698
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,440
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO WAKE HIM.

699
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,700
THAT'S OKAY, HONEY.

700
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:58,988
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

701
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,229
COME ON.
LET'S GET YOU TO SLEEP.

702
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:32,902
COME OVER HERE.

703
00:45:46,935 --> 00:45:48,785
YOU SEE?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

704
00:45:57,812 --> 00:45:59,792
THIS IS
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

705
00:46:02,037 --> 00:46:03,647
AND HE'S ONLY A BABY.

706
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:08,351
WE DON'T KNOW
WHO HE IS YET,

707
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:10,357
OR WHO HE'S
GOING TO BE.

708
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,020
AND THAT IS
A WONDERFUL THING.

709
00:46:24,522 --> 00:46:25,686
SHH.

710
00:46:30,077 --> 00:46:30,907
<i> YEAH </i>

711
00:46:32,672 --> 00:46:33,352
<i> YEAH </i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
