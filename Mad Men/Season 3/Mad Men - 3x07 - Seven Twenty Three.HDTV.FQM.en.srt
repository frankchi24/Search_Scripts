- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- NOW IT MAY TAKE A MOMENT TO GET USED TO.

3
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,262
I TOLD YOU-
MEN DON'T LIKE CHANGE.

4
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,497
WELL, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO JUDGE
WHEN I CAN'T SEE A PRICE TAG.

5
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,398

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,190
- AND WHAT GOES HERE?
- WHERE?

12
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,184
RIGHT WHERE
WE'RE STANDING.

13
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,785
WELL, THAT'S YOUR HEARTH,
DARLING.

14
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,422
THAT'S THE SOUL
OF YOUR HOME.

15

PEOPLE GATHER AROUND A FIRE
EVEN IF THERE ISN'T ONE.

16

PEOPLE GATHER
AROUND A FIRE EVEN

17
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,101
- SO, DON?
- I THINK IT'S FINE, BETTS.

18
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,499
ALL YOU DO ALL DAY AT
WORK IS EVALUATE OBJECTS.

19
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,380
I WOULD LIKE
THE BENEFIT OF YOUR EYE.

20
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:32,854
MOVE THE END TABLE AND THE LAMP
TO THE OTHER END OF THE COUCH.

21
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,400
I THINK
HE'S RIGHT.

22
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,896
- HOT AS HELL ALREADY.
- YES, IT IS.

23
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,865
I WATCHED THE SUNRISE TODAY
- I COULDN'T SLEEP.

24
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,766
- HOW WAS IT?
- AVERAGE.

25

OGILVY WROTE
A BOOK.

I GOT
THE GALLEYS.

00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,474
THEY WANT A QUOTE
OR SOMETHING.

28

UP THERE WITH LAWYERS

<i>IT'LL HELP HIM.</i>

31
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,018
IT'S CALLED "CONFESSIONS OF AN AD MAN."

32
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,087
- I LIKE THE TITLE.
- PLEASE.

33
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,289
IT'S A BOOK EVERYBODY WRITES,
ONLY HE GOT IT PUBLISHED.

34
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,958
IT SHOULD BE CALLED
"1,000 REASONS I'M SO GREAT."

35
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,494
- IS HE PUBLISHING IT HIMSELF?
- NO, ATHENEUM.

36
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,963
I'LL SEND IT OVER.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BUY IT.

- WHEN DO YOU WANT US TO MOVE THE MEETING TO?

40
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,771
- MR. DRAPER?
- MOVE IT?

41
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,539
I'M 15 MINUTES LATE.

42
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,341
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT THEM HOVERING.

MR. DRAPER, CONRAD

45
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,763
- RIGHT NOW?
- HE JUST WALKED RIGHT IN.

46
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,218
- WE WERE WAITING AND HE BLEW RIGHT PAST US.
- HOLD ON.

00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,169
COME BACK
IN 20 MINUTES.

- YOU LOOK GREAT.
- 20 MINUTES.

50
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,095
- YOU CAN TAKE AN HOUR IF YOU NEED IT.
- HE WANTS TO LOOK BUSY.

51
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:57,876
MOVE IT.

52
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,332
ALLISON,
HOLD ALL MY CALLS.

54
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,808
WHAT A GREAT WAY
TO START THE DAY.

55
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,109
9:30?
IT'S PRACTICALLY LUNCH.

56
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,105
WELL, CAN I GET
YOU SOMETHING?

57
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,902
I'VE GOT
A PERSONAL MATTER

58
00:05:18,617 --> 00:05:20,967
THAT'S NOT FIT
FOR THE PHONE.

59
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,064
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? - I DON'T
KNOW WHAT I'M MORE DISTURBED BY-

60
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,800
THE FACT THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE A BIBLE

61
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,235
OR THAT THERE'S NOT
A SINGLE FAMILY PHOTO.

62
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,372
- I'M EASILY DISTRACTED.
- YOU SHOULD HAVE THOSE THINGS.

63
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,953
THEY'LL MAKE YOU FEEL
BETTER ABOUT WHAT YOU DO.

64
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,777
START SHOWING UP
ON TIME.

65
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,746
MAYBE I'M LATE BECAUSE
I WAS SPENDING TIME

66
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,287
WITH MY FAMILY
READING THE BIBLE.

67
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,787
ARE YOU NERVOUS, DON? I'M
FINDING YOU HARD TO TALK TO.

68
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,023
WELL, YOU CAUGHT ME
BY SURPRISE, CONNIE.

69
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,854
I THINK
YOU KNOW THAT.

70
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,192
NOW YOU'RE
A MARRIED MAN,

71
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,038
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO USE
YOUR IMAGINATION, BUT...

72
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,572
I HAVE THIS...

73
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,344
<i>INVOLVEMENT.</i>

74
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,026
I CAN'T SAY
IT'S PERFECT

75
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,292
AND MY NEEDS ARE
BEING MET,

76
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,914
BUT I HAVE
SIGNIFICANT NEEDS, DON.

77
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,871
- DO YOU CATCH MY DRIFT?
- YES.

78
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,798
SO WHAT DO I DO WHEN
MY EYE STARTS TO WANDER?

79
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,029
DON'T YOU HAVE
A COTERIE

80
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,132
OF TRUSTED
ADVISORS, FRIENDS,

81
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,853
KINGS THAT MIGHT
COUNSEL YOU BETTER?

82
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,773
I WANT YOU TO HANDLE
THE WALDORF ASTORIA,

83
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,908
<i>THE NEW YORK HILTON
AND THE STATLER HILTON.</i>

IT'S JUST NEW YORK,

85
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,911
BUT MY EYE HAS DEFINITELY
STARTED TO WANDER.

86
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,473
I THINK THAT'S
A GOOD START.

87
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,655
RETAINER, ET CETERA-
THAT'S FOR LAWYERS.

88
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,256
EVERYTHING ELSE
WILL BE LIKE THIS.

89
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,434
HAVING ME IN YOUR LIFE
IS GONNA CHANGE THINGS.

90
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,965
- I LOOK FORWARD TO IT.
- THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT.

91
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,242
- A HAPPY BUNCH.
- IF YOU SAY SO.

92
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,845
YOUNG PEOPLE GIVE US ENERGY.
DON'T FORGET THAT.

93
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,726
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

94
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,472
IT'S NOT MUCH
TO START WITH,

95
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,585
BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO
SHARING MY DREAMS WITH YOU.

96
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,066
SPEAK TO YOU SOON.

97
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:51,403
<i>I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU JUST HAD
A BABY AND YOU REDID YOUR HOUSE.</i>

98
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,171
ARE YOU SUICIDAL?

99
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,341
- THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE SIMULTANEOUS,

100
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:00,178
AND THE BABY WASN'T THE ONE
THAT COULDN'T KEEP A SCHEDULE.

101
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,113
I ASSUME THIS MEETING
MEANS YOU'RE INTERESTED

102
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,282
IN REPLACING FRANCINE
AS SECRETARY?

103
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,084
- I AM.
- GOOD,

104
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,020
BECAUSE WE WAITED FOR YOU FOR
OUR MOST PRESSING BUSINESS.

105
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,057
THE PROPOSED
3- MILLION-GALLON WATER TANK

106
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,659
WILL NOT ONLY DRAIN THE
PLEASANTVILLE ROAD RESERVOIR,

107
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,696
BUT ALSO BLEMISH THE NATURAL AND
FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY.

108
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,597
WELL SAID.

109
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,067
THE JUNIOR LEAGUE NEEDS
TO TAKE OVER THIS EFFORT

110
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,848
AND EXPLAIN THE ISSUES.

111
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,900
<i>CONSERVATION-</i>

112
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,289
THE "SILENT SPRING,"

113
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,643
THE MAJESTIC BEAUTY
OF THE HUDSON RIVER VALLEY.

114
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,277
WORTHLESS REAL ESTATE

115
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:32,948
SECOND:

116
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,448
ON BOTH SIDES
OF THE RIVER

117
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:40,051
BECAUSE SOME INDUSTRIAL PARK
ON ROUTE 9 NEEDS OUR WATER.

118
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,855
WE NEED TO GO OVER THE VILLAGE
BOARD'S HEAD, APPEAL TO THE GOVERNOR.

119
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,490
THE ROCKEFELLERS OWN
HALF THE LAND HERE.

120
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,561
REAL ESTATE-
THAT'S SCARY.

121
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,966
I MAY KNOW SOMEONE
IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

122
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,067
WHO?

123
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,766
UMM, HIS NAME IS HENRY.

124
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,040
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

125
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,181
HENRY FRANCIS.

126
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,911
HE'S IN THE PAPER
SOMETIMES,

127
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,612
ALWAYS RIGHT
BEHIND ROCKY.

128
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,973
WHAT DOES HE DO?

129
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,032
I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

130
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,652
HOW DO
YOU KNOW HIM?

131
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,987
I MET HIM AT A PARTY FOR DON'S WORK.

132
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,508
OH, HERE HE IS. OH MY.
IT JUST SAYS "ADVISOR."

133
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,862
OH. YES, I KNOW
WHO HE IS.

134
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,964
HE USED TO BE
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CHAIR

135
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,666
FOR WESTCHESTER COUNTY.

136
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,677
I KNOW HIM.

137
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,102
WELL, CALL HIM THEN.

138
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,005
I THINK WE HAVE
A BETTER CHANCE

139
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,256
IF BETTY CALLS.

140
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,844
IT'S NOT ADORABLE TO PRETEND
LIKE YOU'RE NOT ADORABLE.

141
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:40,345
<i>HMM.</i>

142
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:41,853
CALL HIM.

143
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,916
<i>Woman:
HE'S A BIG DEAL.</i>

144
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:45,527
Woman:

145
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,789
MIAMI IS WHERE WE SHOULD
START, LET IT GROW FROM THERE.

146
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,860
HO-HO WANTS IT
EVERYWHERE.

147
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,794
HE JUST BOUGHT LAND IN
SEATTLE. IT'S AN INDOOR CITY.

148
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,430
- AS LONG AS
HE KEEPS WRITING CHECKS.

149
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,265
LOOK, DO YOU WANT TO KILL
THIS THING IN ONE BLOW

150
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,000
OR DO YOU WANT TO SHEAR
THE SHEEP EVERY YEAR?

151
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,781
WHATEVER YOU WANT, DON.

152
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,107
YOU MADE IT CLEAR YOU
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT,

153
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,843
BUT AT LEAST TELL US
HOW YOU KNOW HIM.

154
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,544
WE RAN INTO EACH OTHER
AT A PARTY.

155
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,683
THAT'LL BE ALL.

156
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:28,093
I KNOW ROGER WILL BE
THE FACE OF THIS THING,

157
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,495
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND
DOING THE LEGWORK.

158
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,664
PETE, I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BRING IN THE ACCOUNT

159
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,525
AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE TO BE ON IT.

160
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,402
WHAT HAPPENED WITH
NORTH AMERICAN AVIATION?

161
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,763
IT'S GOING WELL,

162
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,973
MY FRIEND RUSS WHO DEALS
WITH McNAMARA'S OFFICE

163
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,942
SAID THE ORDERS ARE
THROUGH THE ROOF

164
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,878
FOR HELICOPTERS, CARBINES AND
ESPECIALLY JETS FOR VIETNAM.

165
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,546
I THINK I'VE CONVINCED
NORTH AMERICAN

166
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,281
THEY'RE GOING
TO NEED TO SPEND MORE

167
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,250
IF THEY WANT TO GET OUT OF
NASA AND INTO THE PENTAGON.

168
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,219
WHEN THEY DO,

169
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:56,296
WE CAN TALK
ABOUT HILTON.

170
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,532
UNDERSTOOD.

171
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,328
<i>Betty: OH. NO. YES, OF COURSE.</i>

172
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,331
<i>HE'S BUSY.</i>

173
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,319
IT'S WILSON-4-8-0-3-8.

174
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,916
BETTY DRAPER.

175
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,039
HE CAN CALL ME
ANYTIME.

176
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,441
IT'S A CIVIC MATTER
REGARDING OSSINING.

177
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:17,342
THANK YOU.

178
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:18,687
LUNCH!

179
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,156
WASH YOUR HANDS,
BOBBY.

180
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,709
DRAPER RESIDENCE.

181
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,259
MRS. DRAPER,
IT'S HENRY FRANCIS.

182
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,510
YES, OF COURSE.

183
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,930
I APPRECIATE YOU GETTING
BACK TO ME SO QUICKLY.

184
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,532
STOP IT.

185
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,902
COULD YOU HOLD
JUST A MOMENT?

186
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,937
<i>- I'M GOING TO GET ON THE EXTENSION.
- Of course.</i>

187
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:49,218
I'M GOING IN THE STUDY.
HANG UP THE PHONE.

188
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:56,695
<i>DAMN IT!</i>

189
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,354
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- YOU SAID TO HANG UP THE PHONE.

190
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,323
<i>AFTER I PICK UP
THE PHONE.</i>

191
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:05,994
<i>FREEZE.</i>

192
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,696
- DRAPER RESIDENCE.
- IT'S HENRY AGAIN.

193
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,301
- WE WERE DISCONNECTED.
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT-

194
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,022
<i>MY SON.</i>

195
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,304
I KNOW HOW THAT GOES.
HOW ARE YOU?

196
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,041
YOU MUST HAVE HAD
YOUR BABY BY NOW.

197
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,172
YES, I DID.
YOU REMEMBERED.

198
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,047
<i>- What did you have?
- A LITTLE BOY.</i>

199
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,998
CAN YOU GET HIM
REGISTERED BY NOVEMBER?

200
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,254
I JUST REALIZED EVERYONE WHO
CALLS YOU MUST WANT SOMETHING.

201
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,556
ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN DOING
MOST OF THE CALLING LATELY.

202
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,058
WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

203
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,769
WELL, WE WERE
HOPING YOU COULD STOP

204
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,830
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE
PLEASANTVILLE ROAD RESERVOIR.

205
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,633
<i>- WHO'S "WE"?
- I'm representing the Junior League</i>

206
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:49,714
OF TARRYTOWN.

207
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,838
THEY WANT TO BUILD
A 3-MILLION-GALLON WATER TANK

208
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,608
<i>- AND IT'S A VERY SCENIC AREA.
- I know the area.</i>

209
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,977
WELL, IT'S PRACTICALLY
THE GOVERNOR'S BACKYARD.

210
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,679
THAT'S TRUE, BUT I
GREW UP THERE AS WELL.

211
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,982
<i>- Really? Where?
- MOUNT SALEM.</i>

212
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,883
I'M HEADING UPSTATE
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

213
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,009
MAYBE I COULD STOP BY
AND TAKE A LOOK.

214
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,803
WELL, TOMORROW IS
SATURDAY.

215
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,026
OF COURSE.
WORK EVERY DAY.

216
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,394
I FORGET
OTHER PEOPLE DON'T.

217
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,262
NO.

218
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,633
THIS IS
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

219
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,768
I THINK I COULD
FIND THE TIME.

220
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,937
IS SWENSON'S BAKERY
STILL THERE?

221
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,606
IT IS AND IT HAS
AN AIR CONDITIONER.

222
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,074
I'LL BUY YOU
A CUP OF COFFEE

223
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,910
AND THEN WE CAN TAKE
A HIKE TO THE RESERVOIR.

224
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,846
<i>- Is 3:00 too late for you?
- NO, IT'S PERFECT.</i>

225
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,357
<i>- I'LL MAKE IT WORK.
- Well, I'll see you then, Mrs. Draper.</i>

226
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,566
I CAN SAVE YOU
THE TROUBLE-

227
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,568
<i>IT'S FROM HIM
AND IT'S EXPENSIVE.</i>

228
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,449
I'M GOING
TO FIRE HER.

229
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,647
WHAT DID
YOU PROMISE HIM?

230
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,141
- WHO?
- YOU'RE THICK, DO YOU KNOW THAT?

231
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,776
THAT PRESENT-
IT'S FROM DUCK.

232
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,857
HERMES. NICE.

233
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,681
I HOPE YOURS IS
A DIFFERENT COLOR.

234
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,882
"ELEGANCE
AND SUCCESS. DUCK."

235
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,452
I WONDER WHO WROTE
THAT FOR HIM.

236
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,088
- I DON'T TRUST HIM.
- WHY?

237
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,686
BECAUSE HE WANTS US?
WE'RE VERY IMPORTANT HERE.

238
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,580
WHO IS?

239
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,088
DID HE PUT YOU
ON HILTON?

240
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,931
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

241
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:31,052
STOP BARGING IN HERE AND
INFECTING ME WITH YOUR ANXIETY.

242
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,805
THIS IS
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

243
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,474
HE SENT ME
A BOX OF CUBAN CIGARS...

244
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,943
ALTHOUGH I'M STARTING TO THINK
THEY'RE NOT THAT HARD TO COME BY.

245
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,312
HILTON HOTELS?
DID WE GET THAT?

246
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,193
DO YOU LIVE
IN A CAVE?

247
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,383
CONRAD HILTON CAME
TO SEE DON THIS MORNING.

248
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,754
- HE WAS RIGHT THERE.
- REALLY?

249
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,488
- WHAT WAS HE LIKE?
- I ONLY GOT A QUICK LOOK AT HIM.

250
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,857
HE WAS SKINNY,
LIKE A COWBOY.

251
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,059
MY MOTHER GAVE ME
HIS BOOK.

252
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,250
HE'S CATHOLIC.

253
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,130
IT'S GOING TO BE
A HUGE ACCOUNT.

254
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,999
NOT AS BIG
AS LUCKY STRIKE,

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,167
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE
PLANNING A LITTLE OFFENSE FOR ONCE

256
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,236
INSTEAD OF HIDING
FROM THE F.T.C.

257
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,177
- HE HAS A BOOK?
- I REALLY LIKE THIS.

258
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,638
LOOK, I'M KEEPING THIS.

259
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,412
DUCK SAID WE'RE
NOT TIED TOGETHER.

260
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,453
I'LL KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT
AND YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

261
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,152
DO YOU KNOW WHY DUCK
DOESN'T WORK HERE ANYMORE?

262
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:24,188
BECAUSE DON SQUEEZED HIM OUT
WHEN THE BRITISH TOOK OVER.

263
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,539
SO WHAT?
DON DIDN'T LIKE HIM.

264
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,261
IT'S THE WORLD AGAINST DON
AND NOW IT'S SOMEONE ELSE.

265
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,192
TRUE, BUT DUCK WOULD LOVE
TO HIT DON WHERE IT HURTS.

266
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,501
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE

267
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,202
AND I'M NOT
GOING TO TELL DON.

268
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,738
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT DUCK.

269
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:41,869
SEND IT BACK.

270
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,647
WHEN WERE YOU GOING
TO TELL US ABOUT THIS?

271
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,056
I THOUGHT I'D LET IT BE
AN INCOMING PHONE CALL

272
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,517
AND THEN WAIT AND SEE
WHO TOOK CREDIT FOR IT.

273
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,708
THIS IS
VERY EXCITING.

274
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,270
DESPITE ITS
MODEST BILLINGS,

275
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,567
<i>LONDON IS THRILLED</i>

276

FOR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH.

277
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,332
- FINALLY.
- HUZZAH.

278
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,379
<i>IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING,
HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS HAPPEN?</i>

279
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,740
WE TRAVEL
IN THE SAME CIRCLES.

280
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,402
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF WE SHOULD CELEBRATE YET.

281
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,889
HIS LAWYERS CALLED AND THERE'S
A LITTLE MATTER OF THE CONTRACT.

282
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,925
WELL, DON'T BE AFRAID
TO PUSH BACK.

283
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,127
I AGREED
TO THE NEW YORK HOTELS,

284
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,130
BUT EVERYTHING ELSE SHOULD
BE UNDER OUR TERMS.

285
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,965
I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND.

286
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,368
<i>THIS IS REGARDING
YOUR CONTRACT.</i>

287
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,679
OR LACK THEREOF.

288
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,407
<i>Lane: IT MAY SEEM LIKE
A FORMALITY TO YOU,</i>

289
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,642
BUT TO MR. HILTON
IT'S A NECESSITY THAT

290
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,445
<i>ALL THE PRINCIPALS
IN THE FIRM BE SECURED.</i>

291
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,976

I CAN'T BLAME HIM.

292
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,398
I'LL GIVE HIM
MY WORD.

293
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,050
AND HE'LL TAKE IT,

294
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,058
BUT HIS LAWYERS WON'T.

295
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,479
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'LL WANT

296
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,602
YOUR ATTORNEY
TO LOOK IT OVER.

297
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,613
THAT'S BEN MICHELSON, HMM?

298
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,365
IT'S FAIRLY STANDARD-

299
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,378
THREE YEARS, A NON-COMPETE
CLAUSE, A HEALTHY RAISE.

300
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,474
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.

301
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,232
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

302
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,920
I'M CONFUSED.

303
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,257
IF SOMEONE HANDED ME THAT
CONTRACT, I'D BE FILLED WITH GLEE.

304

307
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:49,264
WELL, WE WANT
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

308
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,872
LOOK, I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW
CONRAD HILTON A LITTLE BIT

309
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,563
<i>AND I THINK HE'LL ENJOY
SOMETHING HE CAN'T HAVE,</i>

310
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,512
AND YOU SHOULD TELL HIM
THAT IT MATTERS TO ME.

311
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,993
IT MATTERS TO HIM.

312
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:08,299
STILL, I DON'T THINK ANYONE
TOLD HIM THAT IT MATTERS TO ME.

313
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,705
WELL, THIS IS
THE WAY IT HAS TO BE

314
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,962
AND NOT JUST FOR CONRAD
HILTON, BUT FOR STERLING COOPER.

315
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:20,465
I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE THOSE
PAPERS HOME FOR THE WEEKEND

316
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,126
AND THINK ABOUT THAT.

317
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,485
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

318
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,480
AH.

319
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,390
I MET HIM ONCE. HE'S A BIT
OF AN ECCENTRIC, ISN'T HE?

320
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:46,548
YES.

321
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,930
OH.

322
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,039
OH, JESUS.

323
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,164
- MRS. DRAPER.
- MR. FRANCIS.

324
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,334
I'M ALONE.
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

325
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,335
OH WELL. ACTUALLY, MY FRIEND
COULDN'T GET AWAY EITHER.

326
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,110
I APPRECIATE
YOUR COMING UP.

327
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,012
PLEASE. I LOVE
COMING BACK HERE.

328
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,281
SO MUCH CHANGES,
SO MUCH DOESN'T.

329
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,352
LIKE WHAT?
I'M INTERESTED.

330
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,053
<i>- Woman: CAN I HELP YOU?
- JUST AN ICE TEA, PLEASE.</i>

331
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,704
THAT'S FINE FOR NOW.

332
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:01,265
- WHAT WAS I SAYING?
- YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT COMING BACK HERE.

333
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,569
OSSINING HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A REAL MIX OF PEOPLE.

334
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,972
WELL, AFTER LIVING IN MANHATTAN,
IT WASN'T MY FIRST CHOICE,

335
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,733
BUT IT'S GROWN ON ME.

336
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,376
I LIVED IN MANHATTAN
WHEN I WAS MARRIED.

337
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,212
IT'S OKAY FOR WORK,

338
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,880
BUT I CAN'T SLEEP WITH ALL
THOSE PEOPLE ON TOP OF ME.

339
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,541
LIKE IN A SKYSCRAPER.

340
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,134
MAY I HAVE
A STRAW?

341
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,312
SO YOU HAVE YOUR FOLDER.

342
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,554
I THOUGHT I'D JUST

343
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,861
GIVE YOU THE LITERATURE
AND A COPY OF THE PETITION.

344
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,631
I DON'T KNOW THAT
I'M A GREAT SPOKESMAN.

345
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,267
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME HOW
BEAUTIFUL THE RESERVOIR IS.

346
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,969
I USED TO DO
JACKKNIVES INTO IT.

347
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,570
WE DRINK THAT WATER.

348
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,041
I'VE LOOKED
INTO THIS FOR YOU

349
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,282
AND I'M AFRAID
ITS UNDERWAY.

350
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,925
OH NO.
WE'RE TOO LATE.

351
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,821
MAYBE IF YOU KNEW
SOMEBODY WITH SOME CLOUT.

352
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,189
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU DO.

353
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,358
I'M A CLASSIC STRATEGIST,
FUNDRAISER,

354
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,527
MAYBE CAMPAIGN MANAGER.
I'M WAITING ON THAT.

355
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,708
AND HOW DO YOU
BECOME THAT?

356
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,598
GIVE A LOT
OF MONEY?

357
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,419
NO.
NO, I'M A LAWYER,

358
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,502
BUT I DON'T USE IT MUCH.

359
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,083
WE ALL HAVE SKILLS
WE DON'T USE.

360
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,440
I WAS
AN ANTHROPOLOGY MAJOR.

361
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,521
IMAGINE THAT.

362
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,419
WHERE?

363
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,678
BRYN MAWR.

364
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,317
WELL, YOU MAY BE SAVING
YOUR COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW.

365
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,318
I'M HUNGRY.
DO YOU MIND?

366
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,945
- I DON'T KNOW.
- FINE.

367
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,660
YOU CAN READ FROM YOUR
FOLDER AND WATCH ME EAT.

368
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,661
I'LL HAVE
APPLE PIE AND-

369
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,320
ICE CREAM
OR CHEDDAR CHEESE?

370
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,069
ONE OF EACH.

371
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,357
CAN WE JUST GET
ONE THING OUT OF THE WAY?

372
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,883
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN
DO ABOUT THE WATER TANK.

373
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,381
OH.

374
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,551
DON'T GIVE UP
SO EASILY.

375
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,572
<i>Suzanne: WHAT THIS REALLY
IS IS A CAMERA OBSCURA.</i>

376
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,472
WE CALL IT
A SUN SCOPE

377
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,296
AND IT ALLOWS US
TO LOOK AT THE ECLIPSE

378
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,427
WITHOUT INJURY
TO OUR EYES.

379
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,802
- I DIDN'T BRING A SCISSOR.
- I HAVE SCISSORS.

380
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,706
AND SQUARES OF CARDBOARD THAT
ALREADY HAVE PINHOLES IN THEM.

381
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,708
<i>AND IF YOU REALLY
NEED SOME HELP,</i>

382
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:24,899
ASK YOUR DADS.

383
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,564
THE ECLIPSE IS
22 MINUTES AWAY.

384
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:31,494
- GENTLEMEN,
START YOUR ENGINES.

385
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,851
I COULD HAVE
GONE GOLFING.

386
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,586
I HAD NO IDEA THIS IS
WHAT WE'D BE IN FOR.

387
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,057
GO AHEAD.
I'LL TAKE ERNIE HOME.

388
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:42,560
YOU KNOW, FRANCINE TAUGHT SCHOOL
WHEN WE WERE FIRST MARRIED.

389
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:46,030
I USED TO LOVE SEEING HER STANDING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE LITTLE KIDS

390
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,751
LIKE A TELEPHONE POLE.

391
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:48,499
HEY.

392
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,937
THERE YOU GO.

393
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,004
SALLY HAS A CRUSH ON HER.

394
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,511
WHY CAN'T YOU STARE
INTO THE ECLIPSE?

395
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,346
WHAT'S IT GOING
TO DO, REALLY?

396
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,181
I STARE
AT THE SUN EVERY DAY.

397
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,983
YOU STARE
AT THE SUN EVERY DAY?

398
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,164
WELL, YOU KNOW,
LOOK AT IT.

399
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,724
YOU KNOW, I SEE HER SOMETIMES WHEN
I'M OUT RUNNING IN THE MORNING.

400
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,792
YOU RUN?

401
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,361
YEAH, OVER BY
THE HIGH SCHOOL TRACK.

402
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,463
- DO YOU TALK? - NO. NO,
THERE'S AN ETIQUETTE TO IT-

403
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,124
YOU KEEP TO YOURSELF.

404
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,667
<i>AND HONESTLY, THAT'S ONE OF
THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT MY RUN-</i>

405
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:24,918
<i>IS BEING ALONE.</i>

406
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,110
<i>THAT'S HARD
TO COME BY, YOU KNOW?</i>

407
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,813
LISTEN.

408
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,750
I HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
BUT I HAVE TO BE ON MY WAY.

409
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,341
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

410
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,587
I HAVE TO BE
IN ALBANY FOR DINNER.

411
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:55,000
HIS MASTER'S VOICE-
THE GOVERNOR.

412
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:56,097
IT'S AN OLD AD.

413
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:56,330
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

414
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,079
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- IT'S THE ECLIPSE.

415
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,860
<i>HE MADE
A CONTRAPTION.</i>

416
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,621
DON'T LOOK AT IT.

417
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,189
ARE YOU OKAY?

418
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:24,738
I THINK SO.

419
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,097
I FEEL
A LITTLE DIZZY.

420
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,638
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

421
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,554
IS THAT BETTER?

422
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,145
SO YOU NEVER HAD TIME TO
GO TO THE RESERVOIR ANYWAY.

423
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,214
I ONLY HAD AN HOUR,
BUT I FIGURED-

424
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,925
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED-

425
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,284
- A FAINTING COUCH.
- WHAT'S THAT?

426
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,622
VICTORIAN LADIES WOULD
GET OVERWHELMED

427
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,290
FROM CORSETS
AND THINGS.

428
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,871
THEY'D NEED A PLACE
TO LIE DOWN.

429
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,795
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

430
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,806
I USED TO MOVE
FURNITURE.

431
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,530
MAY I WALK YOU
TO YOUR CAR?

432
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,840
I DON'T KNOW. THIS
IS STILL A SMALL TOWN.

433
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,030
NO, OF COURSE.

434
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,266
- MRS. DRAPER.
- BETTY.

435
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:14,088
HENRY.

436
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,448
SO THAT'S A RAIN CHECK
FOR THE HIKE.

437
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,849
I'LL CONTACT YOU
AS SOON AS I KNOW ANYTHING.

438
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,403
YOU DON'T WANT
TO WATCH IT?

439
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,072
OH, I WILL ONCE IT GETS
A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG.

440
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,341
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU HEARD ME BEFORE,

441
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,744
BUT IT ONLY HAPPENS
ONCE EVERY 10 YEARS.

442
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,915
YOU DON'T WANT
TO MISS IT.

443
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:53,015
- HOW'S YOUR SUMMER GOING?
- IT'S GOOD.

444
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,485
ARE YOU GONNA TAKE
A VACATION?

445
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,466
I DON'T THINK SO.
I'LL GET AUGUST OFF

446
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,523
THEN SEPTEMBER
I'M BACK AT IT.

447
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:01,725
IT'S ALL
FAIRLY PRESCRIBED.

448
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,594
- HAVE YOU BEEN HERE
IN AUGUST?

449
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,296
IT'S A GHOST TOWN.

450
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,023
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?

451
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,695
OH, WE'LL BE HERE.

452
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,759
SO NOW I KNOW THAT.

453
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:17,838
MOST JUST COME RIGHT OUT AND
ASK IF I'M GOING TO BE AROUND.

454
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,845
I WAS JUST MAKING CONVERSATION.
YOU CAN CHANGE IT IF YOU WANT TO.

455
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,314
YOU'RE ALL THE SAME-

456
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,635
THE DRINKING,
THE PHILANDERING.

457
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,511
THEY DON'T KNOW
THAT WORD.

458
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:40,458
DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE
YOU ALONE? JUST SAY SO.

459
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,445
IT'S HARD BECAUSE
THIS HAPPENS A LOT.

460
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,571
NOTHING IS HAPPENING.
WE'RE JUST TALKING.

461
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,056
OKAY.

462
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,078
AND WHERE I COME FROM,

463
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,144
SCHOOLTEACHERS
ESPECIALLY USED TO SAY

464
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:55,779
YOU SHOULDN'T JUDGE
A BOOK BY ITS COVER.

465
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,790
SO YOU'RE
DIFFERENT, HUH?

466
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,873
IS THAT IMPOSSIBLE?

467
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,535
YOU'RE ALL WEARING
THE SAME SHIRT.

468
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,542
SO HOW DO
PEOPLE LIVE ELSEWHERE?

469
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,633
THEY DON'T HAVE
AS MUCH.

470
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,935
THEY DON'T GET
AS BORED.

471
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,379
I'M NOT BORED.

472
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,411
<i>Sally: MISS FARRELL! MISS FARRELL!</i>

473
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,013
I CAN SEE IT! LOOK!

474
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,855
YES, IS HE IN?

475
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,026
TELL HIM IT'S PEGGY OLSON
REGARDING CLOROX.

476
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:12,022
OF COURSE.

477
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,197
HELLO.

478
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,966
MISS OLSON,
WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

479
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,035
I HAVEN'T
CHANGED MY MIND,

480
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,404
AND I'D APPRECIATE
YOU NOT SENDING THINGS.

481
00:28:27,405 --> 00:28:28,972
THINGS YOU WANT
TO KEEP?

482
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,563
I'M SENDING IT BACK

483
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,410
AND I HOPE YOU TAKE THAT
AS A DEFINITIVE ANSWER.

484
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,512
I WOULD IF YOU HAD
ALREADY SENT IT.

485
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,414
LISTEN. I'VE BEEN
HAVING MEETINGS

486
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,316
AT THE PIERRE ALL DAY,
SUITE 600.

487
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,886
AT 4:30 HERMES COMES BY.
GIVE IT BACK IN PERSON.

488
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,988
WHY ARE YOU MEETING
AT THE PIERRE?

489
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,490
HAVE YOU BEEN
TO GREY?

490
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:50,081
IT'S A PENN STATION TOILET
WITH VENETIAN BLINDS.

491
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,465
<i>- I CAN'T DO THAT.
- You can and you will, then I'll leave you alone.</i>

492
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,866
SUITE 600 AT 4:30,
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

493
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,496
PLEASE DON'T
CONTACT ME AGAIN.

494
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,515
HOW WAS
YOUR WEEKEND?

495
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,126
SHORT.

496
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,122
WHAT DID MICHELSON THINK
OF THE CONTRACT?

497
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,324
HE HASN'T
GOTTEN BACK TO ME.

498
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,905
THAT'S BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T GET IT.

499
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,091
I CALLED HIM.

500
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,064
ARE YOU AFRAID YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE A BOSS?

501
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,785
YOU WILL-
THE CLIENT.

502
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,001
- IT'S NOT THAT.
- WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

503
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,140
YOU THINK YOU'RE MORE
DANGEROUS WITHOUT A CONTRACT?

504
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,542
YOU ARE, AND IT'S
AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS.

505
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,111
YOU'RE OUR DAVID OGILVY,
AND IF YOU LET ALL THE BLOKES

506
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,380
AT PUTNAM, POWELL & LOWE
RELAX FOR THREE YEARS,

507
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,482
MAYBE WE COULD PUT
YOUR NAME OUT FRONT...

508
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,563
AFTER MINE...

509
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,802
AND COOPER PROBABLY.

510
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:55,093
WELL, I'LL LET
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.

511
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,966
ALL I NEED IS
A LETTER OF INTENT.

512
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,543
BEN MICHELSON CAN
RAPE US LATER.

513
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,940
GRUNT ONCE FOR YES.

514
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,331
<i>THE PROBLEM IS</i>

515
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,077
<i>I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT
TO DO THIS HERE</i>

516
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,998
OR YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS AT ALL.

517
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,099
DIDN'T WE GIVE YOU
AN OFFICE?

518
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,923
I JUST NEED
A MINUTE.

519
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,455
I NEED TO SEND
MARTINSON'S TO THE PRINTER.

520
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,466
COME ON IN.

521
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,035
SO DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE
GONNA PUT ON HILTON YET?

522
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:38,466
NO.

523
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,941
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY
WANT A WOMAN'S POINT OF VIEW.

524
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,844
- BUT I READ HIS BOOK- - WHO TOLD
YOU WE WERE GOING TO LAND HILTON?

525
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,345
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT,

526
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,681
AND I RESENT YOU BRINGING
WORK IN HERE UNDER PRETENSE.

527
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,951
- OH, I DIDN'T- - I DIDN'T
NEED TO SIGN OFF ON THIS.

528
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,132
I'M SORRY IF-

529
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:57,351
I WAS EXCITED

530
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,257
AND I HEARD THERE WAS
AN AMAZING ASSIGNMENT.

531
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,492
AND YOU THOUGHT YOU'D
COME IN HERE AND ASK FOR IT

532
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:05,863
- BECAUSE I NEVER SAY NO.
- YOU SAY "NO" ALL THE TIME.

533
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,374
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO
FOR YOU? PEGGY, TELL ME.

534
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,821
<i>YOU WERE
MY SECRETARY</i>

535
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,404
AND NOW YOU HAVE
AN OFFICE AND A JOB

536
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,406
<i>THAT A LOT OF FULL-GROWN
MEN WOULD KILL FOR.</i>

537
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,417
EVERY TIME
I TURN AROUND,

538
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,377
YOU'VE GOT
YOUR HAND IN MY POCKET.

539
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,613
<i>YOU WANT A RAISE.
YOU WANT THIS ACCOUNT.</i>

540
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,182
PUT YOUR NOSE DOWN AND
PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR WORK,

541
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,084
<i>BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ONE
THING THAT YOU'VE DONE HERE</i>

542
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,385
THAT I COULDN'T
LIVE WITHOUT.

543
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,284
I'M-
I'M SORRY, DON.

544
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:36,997
YOU'RE GOOD.

545
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,622
GET BETTER,
STOP ASKING FOR THINGS.

546
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,919
CLOSE THE DOOR.

547
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,761
DRAPER RESIDENCE.

548
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,704
BETTY. ROGER STERLING.
HOW ARE YOU?

549
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,148
I'M WELL, THANK YOU.

550
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,718
<i>- Is Don about?
- NO, HE'S NOT HOME YET. SHALL I LEAVE WORD?</i>

551
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:05,489
ACTUALLY, BETTY, IF I COULD
BE FRANK, IT'S IMPORTANT.

552
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,625
<i>- WHAT'S WRONG?
- Well, it's a little touchy.</i>

553
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:12,196
I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU
IN A STRANGE POSITION.

554
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,699
WHAT'S WRONG, ROGER?

555
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,634
WELL, IT'S ABOUT
HIS CONTRACT.

556
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,825
WHAT ABOUT IT?

557
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,239
LOOK, I KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE
ON THE SAME PAGE AS HIM-

558
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,840
HE'S YOUR HUSBAND-

559
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,776
BUT IT'S A LOT
OF MONEY, BETTY.

560
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,477
<i>It's a lot of money.</i>

561
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,286
THREE YEARS ISN'T
THAT LONG, YOU KNOW.

562
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,906
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

563
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,220
I WANT YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU
CAN DO TO GET HIM TO SIGN IT.

564
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,990
I KNOW YOU'RE
THE WOMAN BEHIND THE MAN.

565
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,659
DON IS GOING TO DO
WHATEVER HE'S GOING TO DO.

566
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,829
AND HONESTLY, I FIND IT
TERRIBLY DISRESPECTFUL

567
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,432
- THAT YOU WOULD GO BEHIND HIS BACK.
- EASY, BETTY,

568
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,783
<i>- that's not-
- I HAVE TO GO.</i>

569
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,768
YOU MISSED HERMES.

570
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,216
I WAS GOING TO GIVE YOU
10 MORE MINUTES.

571
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,532
YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY,
HAVE A DRINK.

572
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,020
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?

573
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,123
WHATEVER YOU'RE HAVING.

574
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,791
I'M NOT HAVING ANYTHING.

575
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:15,692
A WHISKEY.

576
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,963
YOU ARE DON'S GIRL,
AREN'T YOU?

577
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:21,914
I WAS RAISED
ON WHISKEY.

578
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,669
SIT DOWN.

579
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,907
A FEW MINUTES OF ADULT
CONVERSATION AND WE BOTH GO HOME.

580
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,463
GREY HAS
HERMES, MACY'S,

581
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,384
H.J. HEINZ BABY FOOD
AND REVLON.

582
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:43,925
- YOU NEED SOMEONE IN A SKIRT.
- EVERYBODY DOES.

583
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,992
- COPY CHIEF?
- MAYBE ONCE THEY GET USED TO YOU,

584
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,994
BUT DEFINITELY
MORE MONEY.

585
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,930
WOULD I GET TO GO
TO PARIS FOR HERMES?

586
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,999
THEY COME HERE,

587
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,417
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE WHERE YOU ARE.

588
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:04,781
- I CAN'T.
- OKAY.

589
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,111
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

590
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,839
THAT'S WHAT
OPPORTUNITY LOOKS LIKE.

591
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,599
I'M JUST SORRY I WON'T
BE SEEING YOU EVERY DAY.

592
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,198
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

593
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,862
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT
ALL THE TIMES I WALKED BY YOU

594
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,693
AND DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

595
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,067
OH.

596
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,528
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

597
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:46,008
WHAT DO
YOU WANT FROM ME?

598
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,653
I WANT TO TAKE YOU
IN THAT BEDROOM,

599
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,689
LOCK THE DOOR, TAKE YOUR
CLOTHES OFF WITH MY TEETH,

600
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:57,830
THROW YOU ON THE BED AND GIVE YOU
A GO-AROUND LIKE YOU'VE NEVER HAD.

601
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,650
BOBBY, SALLY, TURN OFF
THE TV AND GO UPSTAIRS.

602
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,351
WHAT'S WRONG?

603
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,093
ROGER STERLING CALLED.

604
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,260
HE PRETENDED TO BE
CALLING FOR YOU

605
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,863
AND THEN HE STARTED ON ME
ABOUT YOUR CONTRACT.

606
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,064
- WHAT?
- YOUR CONTRACT, DON.

607
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:38,454
IT WAS
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

608
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,275
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

609
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,456
- I'M CALLING HIM.
- DON'T.

610
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,813
BETTS, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT MY JOB.

611
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,716
WHY WOULD I? I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

612
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,886
THEY OFFERED YOU A CONTRACT AND
YOU DIDN'T SAY A DAMN THING TO ME.

613
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,054
<i>I HAD TO HEAR
ABOUT IT FROM HIM.</i>

614
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,865
AND WHY THE HELL
WON'T YOU SIGN IT?

615
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,294
IT DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

616
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,896
YOU'RE TAKEN CARE OF.

617
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,717
WHY WON'T YOU SIGN IT?

618
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,700
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING
TO YOU ABOUT BUSINESS,

619
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,103
<i>SINCE AS USUAL YOU'RE TURNING
THIS INTO SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF.</i>

620
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,104
NO CONTRACT MEANS
I HAVE ALL THE POWER.

621
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,871
<i>THEY WANT ME,
BUT THEY CAN'T HAVE ME.</i>

622
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,007
YOU'RE RIGHT.

623
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:25,356
WHY WOULD I THINK THAT
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME?

624
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,219
<i>IT'S THREE YEARS, DON.</i>

625
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:34,837
<i>WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN THREE YEARS?</i>

626
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,289
GOOD NIGHT.

627
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,384
I LOVE THE TASTE
OF LIQUOR ON YOUR BREATH.

628
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,006
- WHERE YOU HEADED?
- NIAGARA FALLS.

629
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:25,775
BUT WE'LL SETTLE
FOR THE NEAREST MOTEL.

630
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:26,496
HOP IN.

631
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:37,954
THANK YOU.

632
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,193
I'M DOUG.
THIS IS SANDY.

633
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,024
Don:
NICE TO MEET YOU.

634
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,270
- HOW FAR ARE WE?
- A COUPLE OF MILES.

635
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,637
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY WE'RE
GOING TO NIAGARA FALLS?

636
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,358
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

637
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,524
AT NIAGARA FALLS.
FANCY THAT.

638
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,544
PEOPLE KEEP TRYING
TO TALK US OUT OF IT.

639
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:02,555
WHY'S THAT?

640
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,449
WELL, WE DON'T REALLY KNOW
EACH OTHER THAT WELL.

641
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,386
WELL, WE KNEW EACH OTHER
A LITTLE BIT IN HIGH SCHOOL

642
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,522
AND WE'RE NOT REALLY
IN LOVE OR ANYTHING.

643
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,724
I'M SURE YOU HAVE
A GOOD REASON,

644
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,293
NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF MY BUSINESS.

645
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,128
OH, I'M NOT KNOCKED UP.

646
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,397
THEY'RE PASSING A LAW
THAT IF YOU'RE MARRIED,

647
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,931
THEY CAN'T SEND YOU
TO VIETNAM.

648
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,800
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE SERVED, MISTER.

649
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,969
I DON'T WANT
TO OFFEND YOU.

650
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,100
AGAIN,
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

651
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,749
IT'S JUST I'M 1A, 22.

652
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,710
I CAN'T GET INTO SCHOOL.

653
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,313
I KIND OF HAVE A TARGET
ON MY BACK, AND FOR WHAT?

654
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:40,024
I THINK THEY'RE REALLY
GONNA START SENDING PEOPLE.

655
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:44,020
I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
THAT YOU'RE RIGHT.

656
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:45,221
GOOD AUTHORITY?

657
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,417
ARE YOU A SPOOK?

658
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,238
NOPE.
I'M IN ADVERTISING.

659
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,565
NOAY.

660
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,028
NOW THAT'S PRICELESS.

661
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,250
BUT YOU SEEM OKAY.

662
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,139
THANK YOU.

663

A HILLBILLY KNOCKS ON THE DOOR
OF HIS NEW NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE.

692
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,373
"HOWDY, NEIGHBOR,"
HE SAYS.

693
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:06,366
"IN HONOR OF YOU MOVING
INTO THE HOLLER,

A PARTY.

695
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:10,340
THERE'S GONNA BE
A WHOLE LOT OF DRINKING,

696

"SOUNDS LIKE FUN,"
THE NEIGHBOR SAYS.

698
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:20,220
"WHAT CAN I BRING?"
THE HILLBILLY REPLIES,

699
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,731
"YOU CAN BRING
ANYTHING YOU WANT-

700
