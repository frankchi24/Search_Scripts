Previously on Mad Men...

2
00:00:02,212 --> 00:00:05,132
- Do you miss London?
- God, yes.

3
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:07,121
I don't know what I did
to get under your skin.

4
00:00:07,156 --> 00:00:09,655
I have been watching my life...

5
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:13,157
Scratching and I'm trying to get into it.

6
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,186
I'm very sorry.

7
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,804
- I started this.
- I don't know what you want.

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,720
- ***
- So what?

9
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:29,789
So I can't stop thinking about you.

10
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:35,035

13
00:01:08,513 --> 00:01:09,896
- Butter.

14
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:12,593
- And the apples are good now, 
but not from the market.

15
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:15,895
I can go to rodney farms on sunday. 
It's near church.

16
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:19,208
- Can't we go to rodney farms?
- We'll see.

17
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:20,829
Why don't we go to church?

18
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:26,063
- We go to church.
- On christmas. Carla goes every sunday.

19
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,387
We don't need to go every week.

20
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:31,916
- Anything else?

21
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:34,974
It's early.

22
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,974
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes.

23
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:41,492
- How was school today?
- Good.

24
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:45,108
- How come you never ask me?
- I do.

25
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,067
It's just your answer is always longer,
so I thought i'd start with Sally.

26
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:53,816
- When's halloween?
- Before thanksgiving.

27
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:55,992
Francine and carlton have invited us, but

28
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:59,664
I think if we're going to be selling
daddy's house, I don't know,

29
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,407
it might be nice to have it there one last time.

30
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,920
Are you going to sleep here tonight?

31
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,478
No.

32
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:12,925
You're working too much.

33
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:16,791
- Betts, I don't have a choice.
- No, that's not what I mean. I just--

34
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:19,004
I see how hard you're working.

35
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,090
Hello.

36
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:31,242
Inside.

37
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:38,701
Were you grading papers?

38
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,390
Why?

39
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:48,780
I don't know if you're hungry, 
but I made date nut bread.

40
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:50,481
Actually, i made three--

41
00:02:50,514 --> 00:02:52,666
A bake sale.

42
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:58,579
Oh, your service called.
Mr. Hilton was looking for you,

43
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:01,546
but he's probably in the air 
right now.

44
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:04,211
Thanks, Miss Farrell.

45
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,403
That's good to know.

46
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:08,294
I thought so.

47
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:14,042
I want you to spend the whole night.

48
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,153
- You couldn't possibly 
be asleep already.

49
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:51,063
This eight-year-old, Charlie, 
looked up at me

50
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:55,885
during art today and said:

51
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:58,777
"How do I know if what I see 
as blue is the same

52
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:01,124
as it is to you?"

53
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:06,226
And what did you say?

54
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,349
The truth.

55
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:10,244
I don't know.

56
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,840
I never have,

57
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:16,548
but I love that he made me 
think about that again.

58
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,147
What would you have said?

59
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,365
I would have told Charlie

60
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:28,634
that my job is about

61
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:32,710
boiling down communication 
to its essentials,

62
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:35,220
and that I know

63
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,781
that there is a blue

64
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:41,826
that at least 45% of the population 
sees as the same.

65
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:46,339
Maybe half those people think 
they're looking at yellow.

66
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:47,764
Maybe.

67
00:04:48,595 --> 00:04:52,545
But the truth is people may see 
things differently,

68
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,755
but they don't really want to.

69
00:04:57,524 --> 00:04:59,747
Do you feel bad about what you do?

70
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:04,996
Nobody feels as good about 
what they do as you do.

71
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:09,417
Oh. That's sweet.

72
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,344
I wish I could've known you at eight.

73
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:16,379
I bet you were serious.

74
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:20,623
I would've liked you.

75
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,678
Long curly hair--

76
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:30,881
No one has it anymore.

77
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:48,344
- Why don't you take her?
- Because I said no.

78
00:05:48,376 --> 00:05:50,565
You'd rather not go than with me?

79
00:05:50,603 --> 00:05:53,105
What do you think Mr. Draper would say
if you showed up at

80
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:55,867
the sterling cooper 40th with his secretary?

81
00:05:55,926 --> 00:05:57,789
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
- Coffee?

82
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:00,937
- Morning, Don.
- Morning, fellas. Yes.

83
00:06:00,972 --> 00:06:03,422
- Aqua net, 9:00.
- Get Peggy.

84
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:06,495
Don, if you could stand over there?

85
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:08,752
It's Paul Kinsey Theater.

86
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:14,166
This was my thought:

87
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:17,458
Aqua net is about hold, 
but it is also about beauty.

88
00:06:19,502 --> 00:06:21,403
So we're driving--

89
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:24,329
Two couples. I call it "Double Date".

90
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:28,389
The woman in the back's scarf blows off
and her hair starts blowing.

91
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:31,481
- Her hairdo falls apart.
- Oh no!

92
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:35,964
And then the woman in front takes off her scarf 
and hands it back to the woman in the back.

93
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:39,199
- Take mine.
- And he says: "Are you sure, Marcia?"

94
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,189
Marcia's hair is perfect.

95
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,241
And then her date gives her 
a knowing smile of admiration

96
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:48,096
on her confident smile.

97
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:52,042
"Aqua Net. Arrive in style."

98
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,806
Too much story.

99
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:59,443
Every time I hear "and then" there's
another chance for the ladies at home to misunderstand.

100
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:04,689
What if it's just the two couples, 
the wind is blowing,

101
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:08,004
the woman in the back has to put on 
her kerchief and she just looks longingly

102
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,479
at Miss perfect in front?

103
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:13,443
"Arrive in style" still works.

104
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:18,353
And at the end you can see the can 
with the kerchief--

105
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:19,757
Like a see-through one over it 
and the wind blows it off

106
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:21,538
to reveal the aqua net.

107
00:07:21,677 --> 00:07:23,157
A kerchief in a can?

108
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,445
Don't use that,

109
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:27,484
but very nice.

110
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,675
Well, great then.

111
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:31,932
What do you have for Western Union?

112
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:34,269
We don't meet until next week.

113
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,548
Hilton takes precedence, so I need you two

114
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:38,365
to be ready for me at a moment's notice.

115
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,634
And it has to be TV to compete 
with the phone company.

116
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,496
I love getting telegrams, but I never send them.

117
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:47,646
How is that supposed to help?

118
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:51,246
I've got it.

119
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:55,993
My goodness. This is where everyone is.

120
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:59,516
Allison my dear, do you mind?

121
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,957
- All the paperwork is through on your contract.

122
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:08,199
It is my pleasure to deliver 
your signing bonus personally.

123
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:12,221
You see, I don't just fire people.

124
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:17,824
So we finally have an answer to the question: 
"What makes Don Draper smile?"

125
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,598
$5,000 seems to be the number.

126
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,147
I wonder why it took two months.

127
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,749
Will your amigo Connie Hilton be attending

128
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,303
the anniversary party friday?

129
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:29,977
- In his dressiest stetson.
- Splendid.

130
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:32,072
You will be speaking last.

131
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:34,170
It's prime time. Please prepare.

132
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:37,063
I'm sorry to interrupt.

133
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:40,531
Mr. Pryce, your wife is here and 
has requested your attention immediately.

134
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,013
- Where?
- Your office.

135
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:46,810
- What's going on?
- I'll find out.

136
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,789
No, it's okay.

137
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:54,932
Mr. Kinsey to see you.

138
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:56,398
- What was that?

139
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,479
Thank you, Olive. What?

140
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:01,499
I don't need you to put your little 
swirl on top of my idea.

141
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:03,620
- No one's keeping score.
- I am.

142
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,325
And every time we work together,
it looks like you carried the load 

143
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,591
because you're spontaneous, you're a girl,

144
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:10,723
you're his favorite and you use Aqua Net.

145
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:13,159
- Are you nuts? He hates me.
- That's rich.

146
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:16,193
Wearing a dress isn't going to help you
with Western Union.

147
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,348
You do your work.
I'll do mine.

148
00:09:18,513 --> 00:09:20,450
Let the chips fall where they may.

149
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:26,367
Mrs. Pryce, your water.

150
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:28,815
Thank you ever so much, John.

151
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,929
Will there be anything else?

152
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:39,742
Oh, he's such a toad.

153
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:43,016
He is. He is. 
Darling, please sit down.

154
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,912
No. I'm not going to let you force me to do anything anymore.

155
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,510
Am I to entertain your ballad of
dissatisfaction or has something
actually happened?

156
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:51,866
Because I am at work, dear.

157
00:09:56,665 --> 00:09:58,015
Oh, I'm sorry.

158
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:02,490
I went to pick up my gown.

159
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:06,428
The queue for my taxi was 10 long
with tose fat ladies in their furs. 

160
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:10,373
Finally I think I'm en route, but I see the park.

161
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:14,504
I insist it's the wrong direction
and he's obviously running up my fare, which he was.

162
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:16,972
- I'm so sorry, darling.
- I had to stop here 

163
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:21,326
because I'd already taken a $2.25 tour of harlem and that was all the money I had.

164
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:23,983
Oh, well, we'll get you home right away.

165
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,535
Do you have enough cash to get me to london?

166
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:28,902
Because this is not my home.

167
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:32,512
- These things take time.
- Not for you.

168
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,155
If a superior demands that you be happy,
you say: "Yes, Sir. Right away, Sir."

169
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,763
Go on. Let's have it all, shall we?

170
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,137
Oh, you like it here--

171
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:46,246
The smells, the noise and the criminals
at every level.

172
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,503
I have made the best of this.

173
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:53,591
My salary is good. The company is flourishing. My wife has a beautiful gown.

174
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:56,437
May I see it?

175
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,880
It's not London.

176
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:03,478
- It's not even England.
- Well, that's true.

177
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:08,033
I've been here 10 months and no one's ever asked me where I went to school.

178
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:13,493
Oh. I want to scream.

179
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,160
Don't.

180
00:11:15,604 --> 00:11:18,198
Roll over.

181
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:28,164
- Just a minute!

182
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,168
Why did you answer?

183
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,678
I had to see you.

184
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:45,599
I called you from the bus station
in new haven before I started hitching.

185
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,175
I'm so sorry.

186
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,730
Can you give me a minute?

187
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,161
It's my brother.

188
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,053
Get rid of him for 15 minutes.

189
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:02,521
I'll run out. No, it's okay, Don.
Come outside.

190
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:07,414
No. So there's a man in here.
He doesn't need to know it's me.

191
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:10,373
I want you to meet him.

192
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,417
I don't want to ruin this.

193
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:16,015
It's okay.

194
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,229
I promise.

195
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,324
Danny, I'd like you
to meet my friend Don.

196
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,565
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Danny, be polite.

197
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:44,802
- I really am sorry.
- What happened there?

198
00:12:44,803 --> 00:12:47,456
- Is it bad under there?
- Are you hungry?

199
00:12:47,982 --> 00:12:49,398
No.

200
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:51,169
Well, I should be going.

201
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:56,537
Listen, I know what it looks like,

202
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,382
but I'm not a junkie.

203
00:13:00,593 --> 00:13:04,627
Although apparently I'm too dangerous
to push a cart in a public library.

204
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:08,333
- He has fits.

205
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:10,418
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:12,131
I interrupted you.

207
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:14,883
- It's a nice night. I'll see you
in the morning, Suzy.
- Stop it.

208
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:22,772
- I wish you the best.
- You don't even know me.

209
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:33,104
- I'll call you.
- Tomorrow.

210
00:13:45,277 --> 00:13:47,193
He could've just stayed inside your bedroom.

211
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,552
I wanted you two to meet.

212
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:52,583
You're my baby brother.

213
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,727
Well, he knows how to leave a room.

214
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:57,797
Reminds me of mom.

215
00:13:58,414 --> 00:13:59,764
He's just very private.

216
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,454
He's arrogant.

217
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:04,043
- His plans were interrupted.
- You don't know him.

218
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,894
I'm going to get you another job,

219
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:12,867
someplace safe.

220
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:14,499
Safe.

221
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,984
Other people are the problem.

222
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,197
Name such place.

223
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:21,165
People are ignorant.

224
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,415
They're scared of things
they don't understand.

225
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:34,286
I'm really hungry.

226
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:41,228
1923. We were giddy.

227
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:44,937
We didn't know the soup was gonna hit the fan,

228
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:47,261
But we made it through.

229
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,856
All these guys are dead...

230
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:52,089
Except you, of course...

231
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:54,323
And Doug Thompson,

232
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,008
But I wish he were.

233
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:58,371
He left me a whole roll
of bolls laxatives.

234
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:00,043
I thought they were candies.

235
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:02,575
I want him to show up and keel over.

236
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,418
Damn it. I don't want to go to another funeral.

237
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:08,545
Well, I'm not really gonna kill him.
I just would like to, that's all.

238
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:09,941
40th anniversary.

239
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:12,243
40 would be an insignificant year

240
00:15:12,273 --> 00:15:16,265
were it not the average lifespan
of a man in this business.

241
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:19,511
I don't think it's a bad idea to have
a chance to outdrink your clientele.

242
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,478
Who am I kidding?
I don't want to go either.

243
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,969
Have to watch Don Draper accept
an award for his humanity?

244
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:30,739
- Don is important.

245
00:15:31,059 --> 00:15:34,847
- You know, I found that guy
working in a fur company--

246
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:36,232
Night school.

247
00:15:36,928 --> 00:15:38,695
And that girl Betty.

248
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:43,192
I remember Mona said they looked like
they were on top of our wedding cake.

249
00:15:44,312 --> 00:15:45,724
Screw him.

250
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,819
Have the party without me.
I can't do it.

251
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:51,588
I won't.

252
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:54,616
Okay. Okay.

253
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,896
It's just a party.
If you don't want to go, you don't have to go.

254
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:02,002
It's not like it's our company
anymore anyway.

255
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,113
Oh my god.

256
00:16:05,754 --> 00:16:07,104
Remember her?

257
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:19,216
- Can i?
- If you do it right.

258
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:26,360
Hello, draper residence.

259
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:30,437
Hello?

260
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:34,067
There's nobody there.
They hanged up.

261
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,887
- Hang it up.

262
00:16:40,763 --> 00:16:42,169
Why'd they hang up?

263
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:45,051
Probably a wrong number.
People do it all the time.

264
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:47,524
But I could hear somebody
and they heard me.

265
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:51,509
My goodness, Sally Draper.
Try not to take everything to personally.

266
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:55,847
Jeez Louise.

267
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:00,966
WESTERN UNION
What's that, sonny?

268
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,429
The phone is cheap.

269
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,689
It's everday and you can't trust it.

270
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:26,188
The telegraph is

271
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:28,456
Honest, solid

272
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:31,585
and clear. It's old, but it's good...

273
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:34,785
Traditional.

274
00:17:38,564 --> 00:17:40,173
Sorry about that, Olive.

275
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:54,889
Peggy.

276
00:18:57,472 --> 00:18:58,822
Peggy!

277
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:00,874
Hello?

278
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,815
Did you see a girl come through here?

279
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,291
No, Sir.

280
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,779
- I'm Paul, by the way.
- I'm Achilles.

281
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:18,229
Achilles.

282
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:20,094
Well, hello, Achilles.

283
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,905
- Are you okay?
- Are you greek?

284
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:26,208
I'm an american citizen.

285
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:27,784
No, of course.

286
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,583
It's just that's a mighty big name.

287
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:33,378
How did that happen?

288
00:19:33,642 --> 00:19:36,694
It's been in my family for generations.

289
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,060
When we have a party and someone says "Achilles,"

290
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,055
all the men turn their heads.

291
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,680
- In fact, one Christmas--
- Hush.

292
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,457
I've got it.

293
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:53,611
You've got what?

294
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,918
Achilles, I have thought of something
very very good.

295
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:02,259
- I'm glad to hear it.
- Oh, it's truly great news.

296
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:05,103
- Yeah, your whole face changed.
- Did it?

297
00:20:06,278 --> 00:20:09,382
Well, I think I shall sleep
very soundly tonight.

298
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,238
I wish you the same.

299
00:20:47,365 --> 00:20:48,715
- Is that taken?

300
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:52,424
Hey.

301
00:20:55,173 --> 00:20:59,023
I'll only stay for a stop.
I tried to catch you on the platform.

302
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,248
What are you doing here?

303
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:03,095
I need to talk to you.

304
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:13,583
Did you call my house last night?

305
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:17,335
No, I didn't.

306
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:22,407
- This was a mistake.
- Sit down.

307
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:25,623
I'm sorry.

308
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,291
You said you'd call me.

309
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:39,900
Your brother is there.

310
00:21:42,672 --> 00:21:45,250
I don't care about your marriage,
your work

311
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:47,165
Or any of that,

312
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:49,043
As long as I know you're with me.

313
00:21:59,294 --> 00:22:00,644
I'm sorry.

314
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:06,632
I got him a job 

315
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:09,268
At the v.a. Hospital in bedford.

316
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:14,273
He'll be pushing a broom,
but it has nice grounds.

317
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:19,893
You can come back tonight.

318
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:22,224
He'll be gone.

319
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,796
- Are you sure?
- Stop it.

320
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:27,286
Scarborough!

321
00:22:27,287 --> 00:22:28,637
Briarcliff Manor!

322
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:32,787
Scarborough!
Briarcliff Manor!

323
00:22:39,242 --> 00:22:40,781
It was nice meeting you.

324
00:23:03,969 --> 00:23:05,319
Mr. Kinsey.

325
00:23:07,324 --> 00:23:08,674
Paul!

326
00:23:09,948 --> 00:23:12,303
Sorry to wake you.
It's 9:00 a.m.

327
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:17,864
- Good morning, Lois.
- Good morning.

328
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,734
I need you to type something for me.

329
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:37,089
- Were you in here before?
- No.

330
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:39,757
- So you haven't touched anything?

331
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:41,155
- No.

332
00:23:41,272 --> 00:23:42,652
- You do that sometimes.

333
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:52,636
- What was it?
- Does it look like I know?

334
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:54,245
I wrote it down.

335
00:23:55,478 --> 00:23:57,158
I know I wrote it down.

336
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:00,049
Did you find it?

337
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:03,303
It's always the last place you look.

338
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:08,880
My mother always said to retrace your steps if you lost something.

339
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:10,819
Would you shut up?

340
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:14,148
"In conclusion,

341
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,476
With the help of sterling cooper,

342
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:20,208
Its ingenuity and influence,

343
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:24,443
America is teaching business
to the world."

344
00:24:27,873 --> 00:24:29,640
Very rousing, Sir.

345
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,151
Churchill rousing or Hitler rousing?

346
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,981
Mr. Pryce's office.

347
00:24:42,175 --> 00:24:43,586
Just a moment, please.

348
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:47,516
London calling.
Mr. Ford.

349
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:54,222
- Harold.
- Just calling for a status report on our little party.

350
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,604
All is well, although as of late,
Bert cooper will be in absentia.

351
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:00,028
- Well, that won't do.

352
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:03,690
We're flying across the pond.
We expect all the flowers in the vase.

353
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,354
- What does that mean?
Look, Lane,

354
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:08,951
We've had interest in the company
for some months

355
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:11,945
And this party is essential to attracting
a second suitor.

356
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:13,522
For what purpose?

357
00:25:14,298 --> 00:25:15,935
Did we reach you at a bad time?

358
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:17,582
You seem foggy.

359
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:23,196
- Saint John here.
- Oh, hello.

360
00:25:23,197 --> 00:25:25,734
Lane, sterling cooper is for sale.

361
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,614
But why?

362
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:32,500
We've reduced the staff and increased
the revenue by 22%.

363
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:35,031
I think you've answered your own question.

364
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:39,398
We need this party to encourage interest.

365
00:25:39,464 --> 00:25:41,648
- Do your best, lad.
- Yes, of course.

366
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:51,274
- Are you quite all right, sir?
- Yes.

367
00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:52,845
That'll be all.

368
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:08,957
Henry Francis, please.

369
00:26:09,854 --> 00:26:11,324
It's Betty Draper.

370
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,590
How are you?
What a nice surprise.

371
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:29,522
I was wondering if you called
my home last night.

372
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:31,114
No.

373
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:32,674
No, I didn't.

374
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,931
Oh, well, we had a hang up.
I thought it might be you.

375
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:39,756
Really?

376
00:26:40,363 --> 00:26:41,719
I'm terribly embarrassed.

377
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:44,837
Do you want me to call you?

378
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:47,181
No.

379
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:49,040
But you thought it was me.

380
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,930
What are you laughing at?

381
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,982
I didn't call you and I'm not going to,

382
00:26:57,112 --> 00:26:59,176
But if you're going to call me, call me.

383
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:01,117
Don't make up excuses.

384
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:03,392
I'm not playing a game here.

385
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:07,272
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Betty.

386
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,311
- Do you mind? This is rather serious.
- Go ale forward-slash at the beginning of

387
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:26,371
It has come to my attention that

388
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,295
You're not attending the 
Sterling Cooper 40th anniversary.

389
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:34,231
I wouldn't have told Roger if I planned on it remaining a secret.

390
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:40,591
In Great Britain

391
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:43,771
We have a good deal

392
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:47,476
Of testimonials and the senior 
members are all equally unenthused.

393
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:50,048
It marks the passage of time.

394
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:51,956
It's painful, I imagine.

395
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:57,070
I didn't get to where I am
by dwelling on the past.

396
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,725
So think of the future, hmm?

397
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,319
All of our clients,
all of our staff,

398
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:07,419
The press, newspapers
and trade publications--

399
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,450
Enjoy the fruit of your longevity.

400
00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:15,314
You really pour the honey on,
then you lick it off.

401
00:28:18,193 --> 00:28:21,851
Well, if you care about Sterling Cooper at all,

402
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:25,842
Remember that your absence
will make everyone think you are ill.

403
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:36,193
Who told you I was vain?

404
00:28:37,095 --> 00:28:38,445
Please.

405
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:40,984
It's obvious.

406
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:43,071
DECREE OF DIVORCE.

407
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:05,493
I want to show mommy.

408
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:07,471
 Mommy!

409
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:10,057
- Maybe she's not here.
- Carla.

410
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:14,079
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine.

411
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:17,961
I want you to take
the children to the park.

412
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:20,037
Don't come home...

413
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:22,444
Just-- dinner time 

414
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:25,402
Would be perfect.
Take them to the library.

415
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:33,526
Hello.

416
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,140
- I'm glad to see you.

417
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,379
Sorry again. 

418
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:47,653
We were gonna leave 

419
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:50,120
After school and I am still here, obviously.

420
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,692
You want to wait here for me?

421
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:54,442
He has to report tomorrow.

422
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,724
Let me do it.

423
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,433
Let me drive him.
Where are you going again?

424
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:02,621
- Bedford, Massachussets.
- It's a long drive, Don.

425
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:05,123
And you'll have to come back alone.

426
00:32:06,271 --> 00:32:07,779
Let me do this for you.

427
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:13,245
I don't want to say goodbye up there.
It's gonna come out ungrateful.

428
00:32:22,797 --> 00:32:24,683
There's $375 in there, okay?

429
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:29,920
How many times have you done this?

430
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:55,669
Don't you need to gas up?

431
00:32:56,421 --> 00:32:57,771
No, we're fine.

432
00:32:58,307 --> 00:33:00,685
So you're not gonna stop?

433
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:03,556
Do you need to stop?

434
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:07,782
I have some movie in my head where

435
00:33:07,783 --> 00:33:09,715
I give you the slip,
but I might as well tell you:

436
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:12,635
I'm not going to Bedford.

437
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:15,612
Well, I am,

438
00:33:16,136 --> 00:33:17,897
So I guess you kind of have to.

439
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:21,537
Why do you care?

440
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:24,872
You're just gonna go back and screw her.

441
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,382
I don't know if you're capable

442
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:32,582
of understanding, but that job is important.

443
00:33:32,617 --> 00:33:34,832
- Did you get me the job?
- No.

444
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:36,647
So shut up.

445
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,861
I'm not retarded.

446
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:40,858
Julius Caesar had epilepsy.

447
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:44,034
- He ran rome.
- Things didn't turn out so well for him.

448
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:46,317
I know what's waiting for me at that place.

449
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:47,845
I'm 25 years old, Don.

450
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:51,549
I don't want to be cleaning toilets
until I die.

451
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:58,045
Just pull over.

452
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:14,551
Hold on.

453
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,389
What?

454
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:19,167
I'm older than you and I'm telling you

455
00:34:20,055 --> 00:34:23,037
It seems bad now, but you can still
change things.

456
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:25,424
Pull myself up by the bootstraps?

457
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,391
Does that just sound stupid to you?

458
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,928
How do I explain this?

459
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:36,464
I can't do anything that you can do.

460
00:34:38,502 --> 00:34:40,525
Everyone knows, sooner or later,
that there's something wrong with me.

461
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:42,237
They're kind and they try,

462
00:34:42,427 --> 00:34:44,753
But then when I come to 

463
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,625
With piss in my pants,

464
00:34:47,942 --> 00:34:50,374
They stare at me like i'm from another planet.

465
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:54,869
I am afflicted, okay?

466
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,151
It's not a question of will.
I can't change that.

467
00:35:02,831 --> 00:35:04,205
Do you need money?

468
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:06,232
Always.

469
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,340
I swore to myself I would try to do
this right once.

470
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:18,219
Do what?

471
00:35:19,177 --> 00:35:20,651
I want you to call me if you ever need to.

472
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:23,184
And I want you to remember

473
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:26,791
If something happens to you,

474
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:31,085
Your sister will never forgive herself.

475
00:35:35,298 --> 00:35:37,335
You're not gonna tell her, are you?

476
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:40,969
That I let you out 20 miles outside
of framingham?

477
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:52,523
Take care.

478
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:46,211
I know he thought I was passing him off,
but he means the world to me.

479
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:49,873
He knows that.

480
00:36:56,769 --> 00:36:58,834
What was the place like?

481
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:02,460
- Nice.
- Bulls.

482
00:37:06,187 --> 00:37:08,059
He'll be as good as he can be.

483
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:18,283
Don, I don't want to.

484
00:37:19,953 --> 00:37:21,351
I don't.

485
00:37:23,336 --> 00:37:24,686
It's okay.

486
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:28,285
Coffee?

487
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:30,067
No.

488
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:32,675
Can you get my wife on the phone?

489
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,588
- Betty?
- Where were you last night?

490
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:49,684
I told you--
I was with Hilton.

491
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:51,489
Oh, I must have forgotten.

492
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:53,590
Well, did you remember to pick up my tuxedo?

493
00:38:53,775 --> 00:38:55,580
Yesterday.
It's in the closet.

494
00:38:55,955 --> 00:38:57,427
I'll get home at 5:30.

495
00:38:57,659 --> 00:38:59,485
We should leave within the hour.

496
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:02,011
I don't know.
I don't know if I'm going to.

497
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:04,095
What's wrong?

498
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:05,719
What's wrong?

499
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:07,282
What's wrong?

500
00:39:11,204 --> 00:39:12,657
I don't feel well.

501
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,650
Get into bed

502
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:16,908
And grab a hot-water bottle.
You have seven hours.

503
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:19,713
It's all the clients 
and all the partners,

504
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:23,242
and they're all expecting me 
to show up with the glamorous,

505
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:25,128
Elegant, stunning Betty Draper.

506
00:39:27,726 --> 00:39:29,494
I want to show you off, Betts.

507
00:39:32,316 --> 00:39:33,666
Okay.

508
00:39:38,454 --> 00:39:40,809
Are you ready? Don's expecting us.

509
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,706
I've got nothing.

510
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,455
What a relief. 
Mine's garbage too.

511
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,868
No, I had something, 

512
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:53,612
Something incredible, but I lost it.

513
00:39:56,297 --> 00:39:58,103
I didn't write it down.

514
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:02,354
I hate that.

515
00:40:02,596 --> 00:40:05,130
It might've been the best idea I ever had.

516
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:08,276
I did everything: I talked to Achilles;

517
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:12,193
I spent last night recreating every detail of the evening, hoping it would

518
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:16,250
Come back. You know how it is.
There was nothing,

519
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,722
then there was it and now it's nothing again.

520
00:40:18,695 --> 00:40:20,986
I'm so sorry.

521
00:40:22,285 --> 00:40:24,378
how do you talk to Achilles?

522
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:27,329
He is a janitor 
with a very bad memory. 

523
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:30,897
You know what the Chinese say?

524
00:40:31,948 --> 00:40:34,878
"The faintest ink is better than the best memory."

525
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,088
Come on.
We've failed before.

526
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:56,162
Okay, we really looked for advantages.

527
00:40:56,518 --> 00:40:59,238
One of them is, phone calls happen every day.

528
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,298
A Telegram's a big deal.

529
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:02,744
Something like...

530
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:04,131
"She's getting married,

531
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:06,254
are you really just going to give her a call?"

532
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:09,118
Sounds like you are talking
to her parents.

533
00:41:09,181 --> 00:41:11,966
They should really be at the wedding. 

534
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:15,329
Also...
Old people love them.

535
00:41:16,716 --> 00:41:19,046
"When you care,
send one there."

536
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,421
That's a slogan, not an idea.
Paul?

537
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,093
- Mine aren't any better.
- Damn it, Kinsey. What's your excuse?

538
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:28,723
- Don't yell at him.
- Excuse me?

539
00:41:30,615 --> 00:41:32,180
- Tell him what happened.

540
00:41:33,332 --> 00:41:34,682
- No.

541
00:41:37,306 --> 00:41:41,419
The dog ate my homework.
I had a great idea and I lost it.

542
00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:43,536
I didn't write it down.

543
00:41:47,898 --> 00:41:49,668
I hate when that happens.

544
00:41:50,895 --> 00:41:54,275
I keep thinking about that Chinese
thing you said. What was it?

545
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:58,443
"The faintest ink is better than the best memory."

546
00:41:58,962 --> 00:42:00,605
Just makes me think...

547
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,983
You call someone on the phone:

548
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:07,222
"Hello, I'm getting married",
"Congratulations on the baby" and...

549
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:09,259
then you hang up.

550
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,177
It's gone.

551
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,685
It's different if you send a telegram.

552
00:42:16,152 --> 00:42:18,113
Telegram is permanent.

553
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:20,954
Something like:

554
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:23,660
"A telegram is forever."

555
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,807
You can't frame a phone call.

556
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,420
My God!

557
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:39,816
That's the way to go.
You keep working on that.

558
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:43,575
When do you want it?

559
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,232
Party's tonight.

560
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,117
Monday.

561
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,540
See?

562
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:54,092
It all works out.

563
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:02,078
Betts, are you ready?

564
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:06,752
- The car is downstairs.
- The driver is Chinese.

565
00:43:08,147 --> 00:43:09,497
Ready, Betts?

566
00:43:20,275 --> 00:43:22,536
Look how pretty mommy is.

567
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:27,518
Where are we going?

568
00:43:27,643 --> 00:43:29,296
To Waldorf Astoria, mommy.

569
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:32,085
Then we passed it,
it's on 5th Avenue.

570
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,396
It moved years ago.

571
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:37,259
That's right, that's right.

572
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,153
Why did they ever do that?

573
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:43,394
Enjoy the world as it is, Margaret.

574
00:43:44,078 --> 00:43:45,538
They'll change it...

575
00:43:45,573 --> 00:43:47,624
and never give you a reason.

576
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:50,979
Mommy, she is not Margaret,
she is Jane. She is my wife.

577
00:43:52,751 --> 00:43:56,323
- Does Mona know?
- Yes, she knows.

578
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:10,398
You seem surprised that there's traffic.

579
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,517
There's always traffic.

580
00:44:13,138 --> 00:44:15,929
Calm yourself, we'll arrive on time.

581
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,526
They are selling the company.

582
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:21,276
What?

583
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,470
They are selling Sterling and Cooper.

584
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:27,772
- When?
- I have no idea.

585
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,400
What happenned to the Americans?

586
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,884
They'll go to the highest bidder.

587
00:44:36,648 --> 00:44:38,725
I know you hate uncertainity

588
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:42,339
but it complements the fact that
we are returning to England.

589
00:44:53,206 --> 00:44:54,876
I'm gonna keep going on

590
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:59,292
and make Don Draper wait, because
God knows we've all waited for him.

591
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:03,735
As if being...

592
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,629
decorated for his services in
Korea were not enough,

593
00:45:06,664 --> 00:45:09,468
his career, has yielded even more awards:

594
00:45:10,361 --> 00:45:12,413
the American Association of

595
00:45:12,414 --> 00:45:14,742
Advertising Agency's
"Arthur Kudner" Award,

596
00:45:14,777 --> 00:45:18,136
"Printer's Ink" Magazine's
Advertising Gold Medal,

597
00:45:18,171 --> 00:45:20,397
The Advertising Writers Association
of New York...

598
00:45:20,432 --> 00:45:22,520
I'm not reading all these.

599
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:28,075
He is loyal, charming,

600
00:45:28,076 --> 00:45:29,810
quiet, but not modest,

601
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,368
Why should he be?

602
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,942
We have to thank his beautiful wife, Betty,

603
00:45:34,977 --> 00:45:38,155
and his three children,
for sharing him with us.

604
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:42,597
Because as we all know, sometimes
Sterling Cooper has gotten a large share.

605
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,257
Bert Cooper...

606
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,495
and my father Roger Sterling Senior,

607
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:50,954
bravely set this in motion
40 years ago.

608
00:45:51,263 --> 00:45:55,693
Now let me introduce the man who
will stand alongside me for the next 40 years

609
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,830
Our creative director, partner,

610
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:03,299
father, husband and friend.

611
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,778
Don Draper.

612
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:22,171
Please.

613
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:23,965
Please.

614
00:46:25,694 --> 00:46:27,044
Please.

615
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:30,517
I'm very honored.

616
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:37,246
