Taiwan set to elect first female leader
Hong Kong (CNN)

Voters in the only Chinese democracy are expected to elect Taiwan's first female leader when they go to the polls Saturday for presidential and parliamentary elections.

Polls suggest a landslide win for Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), after eight years under the pro-China Kuomintang, or Nationalist, party.

The DPP has traditionally leaned in favor of independence -- a highly charged issue with China viewing Taiwan as a breakaway province that could be taken back by force if necessary.

But that's not the only factor at stake in what is a landmark election for the young democracy, where people take their right to vote extremely seriously.


Stella Han, who is among the roughly one million Taiwanese living in China, says she will fly back from her current home in Shanghai for election day. She plans to vote for the DPP.

"I hope that Taiwan won't rely on China too much. It needs to find a way out," she says.
