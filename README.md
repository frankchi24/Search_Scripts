# Search_Scripts
This is a little tool helping me teach English with some American TV Shows.

User can search sentences and words in TV series scripts. They can search in a specific season or all seasons, they can also search multiple tv shows. They can also print the results as txt files if they want to.

TV Shows supported:
"How I Met Your Mother", 
"The Big Bang Theory",
"Game of Thrones",
"House of Cards",
"Breaking Bad",
"Mad Men",
"Suits",
"The Newsroom",
"Sex and the City"

Fork the files and run the search_lines.py with python.
Make sure to change the os_path on line 31 to the path your store this file
