00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,533
- Back up.
- Sure.

3
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,151
- How many?
- Bridesmaids?

4
00:01:26,153 --> 00:01:27,419
- Yeah.
- Nine.

5
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:28,954
Nine bridesmaids?

6
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,823
<i>My sisters, your sisters, Sheila,
Sloan, Maggie, and Diane.</i>

7
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:34,993
- Who's Sheila?
- My brother's wife Sheila. You've met her.

8
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:38,129
- And who's Diane?
- Sawyer.

9
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,382
And because you have
nine bridesmaids...

10
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,967
You need nine groomsmen.

11
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,385
That's, like, a law?

12
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:46,805
<i>The groomsmen have to walk the
bridesmaids down the aisle.</i>

13
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,673
Well, Charlie's my best man.

14
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,843
What if I have him just keep going back
up the aisle and fetching bridesmaids?

15
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:55,063
Is there any chance Charlie is going
to be sober when the ceremony starts?

16
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:56,932
I have news for you...
Your sisters will have taken

17
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,516
a couple of dips
from the well, too.

18
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:02,020
Charlie, Don, Jim,
Elliot, and who else?

19
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,689
There is no one else.

20
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,324
I've worked very hard
at cultivating

21
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,943
no friendships outside of work.

22
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,327
And to be honest,
I was doing fine

23
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,112
cultivating no friendships
inside of work

24
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:13,365
- until you came along.
- You need five more.

25
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,533
Nine bridesmaids is madness.

26
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,253
The amount of time it's going to take
18 people to walk down the aisle...

27
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:21,673
You're telling me Diane Sawyer's going
to put on a dress with puffy shoulders?

28
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:23,925
The bridesmaids
are wearing Vera Wang.

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,760
Can Vera Wang make
that many dresses?

30
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:27,929
How about Brian Williams?
You love Brian.

31
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,066
You love Brian.

32
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:31,600
And if he's up there next to me,
you're gonna start to think.

33
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,802
In fact, the whole idea of parading
a bunch of well-dressed men

34
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,021
in front of you right before
you're asked the big question...

35
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,139
And don't get me wrong,
but I've now seen you commit

36
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,859
to three different shades of tile
for the master bath before...

37
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:43,028
- Did you see that?
- What?

38
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:46,064
- What is it?
<i>- Switcher.</i>

39
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:49,734
Ben, what feed are you running
on 44B in the bull pen?

40
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,453
<i>That's a local
Boston affiliate.</i>

41
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:53,238
<i>Somebody wanted
to watch the marathon.</i>

42
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,873
What'd you see?

43
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:57,042
An explosion.

44
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,743
What just happened in Boston?

45
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,378
<i>I've got multiple alerts,
all red.</i>

46
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,380
Blast at the finish line
of the marathon.

47
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,915
Runners and spectators
fleeing the scene.

48
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,667
<i>The finish line's
at the Lenox Hotel.</i>

49
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,102
- There might be a fire.
- Look at that runner.

50
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,670
- <i>Can we get some audio?</i>
- The way he falls to the side.

51
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,305
<i>- That's an energy force.
- That's an explosion.</i>

52
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:12,257
- Break them into teams.
- Boston affiliate.

53
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:14,426
Boston PD.
FBI. DOJ.

54
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,428
Homeland Security.
Area hospitals.

55
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,813
- Jenna!
- On it!

56
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,737
And five, and four,

57
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:27,238
and three,

58
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,575
<i>and two, and one.</i>

59
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,329
Okay, take a breath and...

60
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:36,281
Okay, hot stuff, what you got?

61
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,450
Come on, focus.

62
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,368
Focus.
You're bad.

63
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,754
You are bad.
You're a bad fucking lady.

64
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:44,522
<i>Give me 10 more.</i>

65
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,458
No phone.
Tune that out.

66
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:48,710
Love the pain.
Eat the pain.

67
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:52,013
Counting six, and five,

68
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:55,800
and four, and you stopped.

69
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,220
Good session.

70
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:02,140
Can you confirm that the explosions were
caused by bombs and not a gas line?

71
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:04,309
Were there any credible threats
made in advance of the race?

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,610
This is Martin Stallworth
at ACN.

73
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:07,312
This is Tess Westin at ACN.

74
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,114
<i>SWAT's on the
scene along with K-9 units.</i>

75
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,316
I want to get accurate
information out quickly, Mike.

76
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,652
We're both doing a job and I'm at the
only reliable breaking news network.

77
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:16,488
Except for that one time, yes.

78
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:17,956
I've got an image of the area
around the finish line.

79
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,574
Throw it up
on the front monitors.

80
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,876
<i>Can you tell me if you've
got terrorist groups...</i>

81
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,661
Use the number in this.
It's the White House.

82
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,997
Don't ask who's on the other end of the phone.
Just say it's for me.

83
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:29,634
Is anyone getting through to the trauma
center or the ER at Mass General?

84
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,721
Nobody's picking up at Mass General,
Brigham and Women's, Beth Israel.

85
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:35,390
- That's not a good sign.
- When is she breaking in?

86
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:37,175
When she knows what
she's breaking in with.

87
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:40,011
- That's right, right?
- We're gonna do this thing well.

88
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,647
- We are.
- Do you know what that means, doing it well?

89
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:44,399
Yeah.

90
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,518
She's holding for you.

91
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,603
- Yeah?
- <i>"2:52 P.M.</i>

92
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,405
- <i>I don't know what the fuck that was"...</i>
- Hang on.

93
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,824
..."but I'm shaking.
Everyone's sprinting through the Back Bay."

94
00:04:52,858 --> 00:04:55,693
"2:54, explosions
on Boylston Street."

95
00:04:55,745 --> 00:04:58,163
"2:54, mass casualty
incident declared

96
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,198
at the end of the Boston
Marathon route."

97
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm not putting Will on the air
to say something bad

98
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,385
may have happened in Boston,
but we're not sure what.

99
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,287
This isn't speculative anymore.

100
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:09,257
We're not going based on tweets
from witnesses we can't talk to.

101
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,792
What credible news agency
would do that?

102
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,177
Fox is up.

103
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,045
Ugh! Jim.

104
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,598
<i>The president's been notified
of the incident in Boston.</i>

105
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:18,933
What is the incident in Boston?

106
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,602
They were hoping we knew.

107
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,520
What am I looking at?

108
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,355
That's Boylston Street.
That's the finish line.

109
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,441
Over there's the Lenox Hotel.
That's where the blast came from.

110
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:28,309
- Inside the hotel?
- We don't know.

111
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,196
If I learn what happened
by watching the news,

112
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,565
I'm going to lose
my fucking mind!

113
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,233
We're dramatically
understaffed.

114
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:37,235
- Where's Keefer?
- Don's got jury duty today.

115
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:38,987
Are you kidding?
Get him out.

116
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:42,073
I'm a schoolteacher.
I teach fourth grade.

117
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,793
<i>- Where?</i>
- PS 40 here in Manhattan.

118
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,412
<i>- Have you ever bought anything over the phone?</i>
- Yes.

119
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,464
<i>From one of those commercials you see on TV?</i>

120
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,083
- <i>Yes.</i>
<i>- What have you bought?</i>

121
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:55,220
<i>I bought something that removes
scratches from your car.</i>

122
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,256
- Good. Anything else?
<i>- No.</i>

123
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,308
And did you have a good
experience with that product?

124
00:06:00,342 --> 00:06:01,976
Your Honor,
may I approach the bench?

125
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:03,344
What? Why?

126
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,513
I really can't say
in front of all...

127
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,765
- If I could just...
- Approach. Hurry up.

128
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:12,103
Um...

129
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,156
my name is Don Keefer.
I'm a producer at ACN.

130
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:17,442
There's been an explosion at the
finish line of the Boston Marathon

131
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,860
and I have to get back
to my newsroom.

132
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,278
- Was anyone injured?
- I don't know.

133
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,330
- Was it a terrorist attack?
- I don't know.

134
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:24,699
- Do they have a suspect?
- These are all things that I'd like the answer to,

135
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,000
but I can't find
them out from here.

136
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,368
- Mr...?
- Keefer.

137
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,087
All these people
have someplace else to be.

138
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,206
I'm sure your network
can do the news without you.

139
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,958
You're probably right,
but I'd hate for my boss to find that out.

140
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:35,460
Take your seat.

141
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:38,630
Uh, look,
you don't want leaders on the jury, right?

142
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:41,099
<i>Anyone who can take charge
during deliberations.</i>

143
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,884
I run a news broadcast
five nights a week

144
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,687
with a staff of 60 and I
bend them to my will.

145
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,639
Plus, I'm currently the
defendant in two lawsuits

146
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:48,973
being brought
by the same person,

147
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:51,609
so even though I bought
your client's bagel slicer

148
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,561
at 3:00 A.M. and it nearly
took my fingers off,

149
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:56,814
there is simply no way in hell that
I am finding for the plaintiff.

150
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,783
- Get out of here.
- Thank you.

151
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:10,245
Hey.
You got dismissed from jury duty?

152
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,547
Sort of.
What are you doing?

153
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:15,166
They finally got one for me.
A Bloomberg terminal.

154
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,835
This is a $24,000 system that
gives me instantaneous access

155
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,888
to all the financial
information in the world.

156
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:22,257
Do you know what's going
on outside your door?

157
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,678
It's not on there.

158
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,515
- When are we breaking in?
- When Mac says so.

159
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,686
- Neal.
- Yeah?

160
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:39,991
I'm tracking 2,221 tweets
describing two explosions

161
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,876
at the finish line
of the Boston Marathon.

162
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,494
What exactly
are we waiting for?

163
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,280
Are any of them
from official sources?

164
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,166
Do you guys understand the explosion
occurred in the 21st century?

165
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,919
Welcome to ACN.

166
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:52,537
By the way,
there's a message that came in

167
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:54,255
for you personally
over the secure site.

168
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,090
Someone wants
your encryption key.

169
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,043
It's just a conspiracy sleuth eating cat food.
Put it aside.

170
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,298
<i>But if it was a bomb,
obviously that escalates...</i>

171
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,799
<i>There have
been a lot of questions</i>

172
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,684
<i>about how many
you've been able to treat.</i>

173
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,304
<i>- We haven't...
- Some who initially were unidentified.</i>

174
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,222
<i>The Supreme Court hears
a patent case</i>

175
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,274
<i>involving companies that
are patenting human genes.</i>

176
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,810
No, no, guys.
Take your time.

177
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,978
<i>...to debate gun control.</i>

178
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,397
<i>And on the lighter side
of things...</i>

179
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,066
We have to ask ourselves if we're
being gun-shy because of Genoa.

180
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:24,485
I don't see anything wrong with
being gun-shy because of Genoa.

181
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:27,205
- I do.
- When Reagan was shot in '81,

182
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,489
the three networks went live.

183
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,208
Reagan was shot.
No, he wasn't.

184
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:32,410
<i>Yes, he was.
James Brady is dead.</i>

185
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:34,245
<i>No, he's not.
It was mayhem.</i>

186
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,831
We're not first, so we might as
well be last and know something.

187
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,166
I agree.
What about you?

188
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,084
It's more than getting
our facts straight.

189
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,470
It's more than getting our facts
straight or having facts.

190
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:45,056
- Facts are important.
- Facts are important, obviously.

191
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,559
But, look, Mrs. Lansing told us to
get the trust of the audience back,

192
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:52,347
and here it is,
an unwelcome opportunity to be sure.

193
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,265
- Will, there's not really...
- Here's what I'm trying to say.

194
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,300
These situations
can be like church.

195
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,854
They can be... They can show us what...
They can guide us in...

196
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:01,689
This isn't going to be
a reality show.

197
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,108
We don't do good TV.
We do the news.

198
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,277
- I said that.
- I know, and you were 100...

199
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,613
Americans are serious people

200
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:11,165
and we can reflect that back
to them in the worst of times.

201
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,203
Exalting their dignity by showing
a little of it ourselves.

202
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,288
- By showing a lot of it.
- Will, they've got to keep...

203
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,124
Don't reach for common ground.
Reach for higher ground.

204
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,709
Am I saying this right?

205
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,045
- He's saying we're the grown-ups.
- Get back to work.

206
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,547
- I think I blew that speech.
- They got some of it.

207
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,599
Nothing official yet?

208
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,720
We know the Supreme Court heard
a case about patenting genes.

209
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:34,806
- Pants?
- Genes!

210
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:36,891
- Human genes!
- Take it easy.

211
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:38,609
I want to go to Boston.
It's my hometown.

212
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,112
- I want to be on the ground.
- Take a producer.

213
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:42,814
Amy's on vacation.
Leon's in Prague.

214
00:09:42,865 --> 00:09:45,900
Mac, Maggie can do it.
She can do it.

215
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:49,120
She knows Boston. She's cultivated sources.
She can do this now.

216
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:52,073
I don't make those calls, but she gives me
anything less than I want and she's fired.

217
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,792
I'll make that call 'cause I don't
think she's cut out for this anymore.

218
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,327
She is.

219
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:59,497
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

220
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,416
- <i>Do you have a go-bag?</i>
- What?

221
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,502
- A go-bag.
<i>- I have a gym bag.</i>

222
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:06,838
Go!

223
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
Confirmed,
Boston PD and the FBI.

224
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:10,591
- Two devices detonated...
- Herb, Jake, Joey,

225
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:12,510
- hijack the control room.
<i>- ...at the finish line of the marathon.</i>

226
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:15,430
- <i>Multiple critical injuries. Affiliates at the scene.</i>
- Let's go.

227
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,071
<i>...where they
established a strategy</i>

228
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:25,773
<i>for this January's
bitterly contested budget,</i>

229
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:28,242
<i>after which President Obama
and Senate Republicans</i>

230
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:32,630
<i>agreed to a tax increase
on 77% of Americans.</i>

231
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:34,699
<i>So much for the president's
promise not to raise...</i>

232
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,535
- Herb, let's get Boston up.
- Give her Boston on previews A and B.

233
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:39,454
- Graphics on C.
- DC control, this is New York.

234
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,539
<i>We're making the handoff.
Herb's got the con.</i>

235
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,509
This is Mac in New York.
Stay with me.

236
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,461
Two explosive devices
have detonated

237
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,429
at the finish line
of the Boston Marathon.

238
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:53,601
We go now to Juan Gomez with
our Boston affiliate WBAS TV,

239
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:55,636
who's standing by live
at the scene.

240
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,439
Tap your pen for me
if you copy.

241
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:00,224
Josie, I have to cut you off.

242
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:02,143
We're getting some breaking
news out of Boston.

243
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,228
Go, G1.
Stand by, Boston.

244
00:11:06,982 --> 00:11:09,317
<i>Two explosive devices
have detonated</i>

245
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,869
<i>at the finish line
of the Boston Marathon.</i>

246
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,238
<i>And we want to take you now
to our Boston affiliate</i>

247
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,707
<i>WBAS and Juan Gomez,
who's at the scene.</i>

248
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,043
- <i>Juan.</i>
- Good job.

249
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:21,462
That was good back there.

250
00:11:21,497 --> 00:11:23,247
Why wasn't I able
to put my finger

251
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,082
on what we're talking about,
you and me?

252
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:26,584
- You want to know why?
- Yeah.

253
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,137
Because it's obvious.
Where the hell have you been?

254
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,255
Shirking my civic responsibilities
as fast as I could.

255
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,891
If it was a suicide bomber,
there'd be a body.

256
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,061
So whoever did it is walking the
streets of Boston right now

257
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:40,681
and there's gonna be a manhunt like
we haven't seen since Dallas in '63.

258
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:42,767
This is gonna go on
for a while.

259
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,820
Elliot's on his way to Boston,
Terry's on maternity leave,

260
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:47,522
and we'll be a couple
of anchors short.

261
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,106
We'll take long shifts
and double up.

262
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:51,492
- Clear.
- Good luck.

263
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,996
The explosions
were 12 seconds apart

264
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,198
and right now we've got
14 confirmed injuries,

265
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,916
but that number is
obviously not gonna hold.

266
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,252
- Critical?
- We're hearing about amputations.

267
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:07,875
- Thank you.
- It was a good speech before.

268
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:10,595
Was it? 'Cause I didn't think
it was nearly specific...

269
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,263
<i>Stand by, he's coming to you.</i>

270
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:15,066
<i>...and first responders
treating people on the scene.</i>

271
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,134
<i>Juan,
this is Will McAvoy in New York.</i>

272
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,303
...what is clearly
a terrorist attack

273
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,472
at a sporting event
followed around the world.

274
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:25,026
Anthony Tagliano,
our law enforcement analyst, is standing by.

275
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,694
Anthony,
is there anything you're able to read from...

276
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:30,348
Welcome back to our breaking news
coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings.

277
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,650
A White House official tells us the
president received a briefing...

278
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:34,902
A trauma nurse at the scene
just told us the medical tent

279
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:38,039
is dealing with everything from
severed limbs to severe burns.

280
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:41,209
The victims are being taken away by
ambulances as they arrive at the scene.

281
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:43,794
The finish line is located
in the middle of four

282
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,830
<i>of the best hospitals
in New England.</i>

283
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:47,548
<i>...press conference
just a few moments ago.</i>

284
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,668
Police Commissioner Ed Davis
has confirmed two deaths...

285
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,170
- S-U-Z-I.
- Copy.

286
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,840
- Suzi Ochi.
<i>- Okay, we've got Suzi Ochi,</i>

287
00:12:55,891 --> 00:12:59,310
an eyewitness who was finishing the
race when the explosions occurred.

288
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:01,012
Suzi, can you hear me?

289
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,351
- Maggie Jordan.
- Elliot Hirsch.

290
00:13:07,402 --> 00:13:09,520
I'm Eddie.
I'm your cameraman and driver.

291
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:12,023
You want to go to your
hotel and get checked in?

292
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,025
We want to go to Boylston.

293
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,447
<i>I'd literally just crossed
the finish line,</i>

294
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,699
<i>took three steps,
heard a loud explosion,</i>

295
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,502
<i>turned around and there was a cloud
of smoke that appeared to be...</i>

296
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,871
Will, we've got another
confirmed casualty.

297
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:28,673
Male, eight years old.

298
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,091
<i>...you hear
tons of applause.</i>

299
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,043
<i>For a second I thought that the
bomb might even be thunder.</i>

300
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,128
<i>Slow but steady
recreational runners...</i>

301
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,614
Bombs need detonators like a
garage door opener or something.

302
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,549
How far away can a person be
from the device?

303
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,685
<i>We've heard from authorities
that they believe these</i>

304
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,687
<i>to be improvised devices.</i>

305
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,223
What kind of detonator would that need
and does the person have to be present?

306
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,109
<i>No, it can be a timed device</i>

307
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:51,228
<i>and you can also be miles away and
set it off by calling a cell phone.</i>

308
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,231
<i>Sloan, truthfully,
it's not hard to blow something up.</i>

309
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:57,902
- Recap.
<i>- Thanks again to FBI profiler Frank Harris.</i>

310
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,788
<i>To recap...</i>

311
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:05,576
Okay, sir, thank you.
Thank you for your time.

312
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,546
That was a nurse.
Surgeons are pulling ball bearings

313
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,831
out of patients in two different
operating rooms right now.

314
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:13,417
- Did he say...
- They're coming to you.

315
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,336
31.

316
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,339
<i>Sloan, I'm outside Boston's
Brigham and Women's Hospital</i>

317
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,092
<i>where officials are telling us they're
currently treating 31 patients</i>

318
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:24,261
<i>for injuries that range from cuts
and lacerations to amputations.</i>

319
00:14:24,313 --> 00:14:25,930
- This is good, Maggie.
- Yeah.

320
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:28,399
<i>...removing ball
bearings from a patient's leg.</i>

321
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,985
<i>Are the hospitals equipped to handle
the number of serious injuries?</i>

322
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:32,770
<i>The World Trade Center,
of course, involved</i>

323
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,955
<i>both thousands of people
and iconic buildings.</i>

324
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,942
<i>Right, Will, and here it wasn't
an iconic building that was the target.</i>

325
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,610
How are you doing?

326
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,245
She got a ton of stuff first.

327
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,948
- It's just that Mac wasn't willing to go...
- I know.

328
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,083
Social media is going
to solve this crime.

329
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,201
Crowdsourcing law enforcement.

330
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,670
That went off
without a hitch in Salem.

331
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,690
Go home and sleep a few hours and
then come back and relieve Neal.

332
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:54,375
I've got to post a column.

333
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,427
Do it from home.
We're gonna need fresh legs.

334
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:59,296
- What about you?
- I'll stay a couple more hours.

335
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,465
Okay.

336
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:03,851
I'll see you later.

337
00:15:03,885 --> 00:15:06,470
Wait, what was the thing
from this afternoon?

338
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,889
The guy who wanted
my encryption key.

339
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,308
I put it in your desktop
under "cat food."

340
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,443
See you in a little bit.

341
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:14,028
<i>As of yet,
no individuals or groups</i>

342
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:15,363
<i>have claimed responsibility.</i>

343
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,318
<i>She didn't seem surprised,
but she did suspect</i>

344
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,654
<i>it was an indication that this
wasn't an organized terror cell.</i>

345
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,322
<i>Did your source indicate
what she believes</i>

346
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,874
<i>might have motivated
the bombing?</i>

347
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:28,542
<i>At this time she
can only speculate.</i>

348
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:31,328
<i>The Boston Police Department
is questioning local people</i>

349
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,998
<i>in connection with the bombings,

350
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,050
<i>The FBI is stepping in
to take over investigations...</i>

351
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,668
<i>...and we're being told that they've stopped</i>

<i>all transportation
into and out of the city</i>

353

355
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:55,463
_

356
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,272
<i>Among the three dead
is an eight-year-old boy</i>

357
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:00,691
<i>whom </i>The Boston Globe
<i>has identified this morning</i>

358
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:04,028
<i>as Martin Richard of Dorchester,
Massachusetts.</i>

359
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,248
<i>We understand friends and
family will gather tonight...</i>

360
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:09,667
- You've got to like that.
- What's that?

361
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:11,285
Oh, God, no,
I didn't mean the boy.

362
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,454
I meant that the hotel TV
is tuned to ACN.

363
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,257
They change it over from CNBC
when I eat breakfast here.

364
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,043
If Maria Bartiromo walks in,
they'll find the remote in a hurry.

365
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:20,511
Listen,
I'm gonna need to get back...

366
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:22,213
Hang on.
You've got a tag.

367
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:27,017
- Thank you.
- Someone didn't sleep at home last night.

368
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,686
- I slept at my friend's and needed a fresh...
- Yeah.

369
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,221
- April 10.
- Yeah.

370
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,690
A lot of investors got caught out
when the Dow and S&P popped,

371
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:35,893
and I'm hearing a number of hedge
funds were short the big indexes.

372
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,311
- Who do you think won?
- Our clients.

373
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,363
- Okay.
- Let me get that.

374
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:40,698
- No.
- Come on, you got it last time.

375
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,900
I'm not allowed to let Goldman
Sachs buy me breakfast.

376
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,902
You had an English muffin.

377
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,288
- Hey, you know Billy Posener?
- The head media guy at Merrill?

378
00:16:47,322 --> 00:16:49,573
Wife and two kids and he was
caught having an affair

379
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,743
with his 24-year-old assistant,
whom he hired personally

380
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,247
after two years of... I'm not joking...
circus school didn't work out.

381
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:59,467
So he's gonna get fired and
Merrill's whole media department's

382
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,152
gonna be without
a rudder for a while.

383
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,672
Or acrobats, probably.
Thank you.

384
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,173
Thank you, Miss Sabbith.

385
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,644
<i>In a news conference
that ended just minutes ago</i>

386
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,763
<i>behind me at the state house,
Governor Deval Patrick</i>

387
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,483
<i>has stated that only
two devices were found.</i>

388
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:17,268
<i>None of the other evidence
collected at the scene</i>

389
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,521
<i>indicates that any other unexploded
devices will be found.</i>

390
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,556
<i>The governor has also said...</i>

391
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:25,993
- Yeah, it's my office.
- I'm just here.

392
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:28,412
- You all right?
- I'm hiding from the twins.

393
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:29,830
Who are the twins?

394
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:32,416
I'd guess you'd have to say
my brother and sister.

395
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,952
Until this moment,
I didn't know you had siblings.

396
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,086
How's that possible?

397
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,122
Half-brother,
half-sister.

398
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,508
My father's kids
from his second wife.

399
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:42,960
- Randy and Blair.
- Which one's which?

400
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,845
- Doesn't really matter.
- What do they do?

401
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,931
They go to parties.
They go to clubs.

402
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,048
They order bottle service.

403
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:49,466
They do a lot
of philanthropic work

404
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,802
as long as it's a party
at a club with bottle service.

405
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,971
They're like the brothers from
<i>A Night at the Roxbury</i>

406
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:56,056
if one of them was a woman
and the other one was dumber.

407
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:58,642
They're up from South Beach
for one of several

408
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:01,145
25th birthday parties
they're throwing for themselves.

409
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,097
I take it your dad
left them some money.

410
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:05,783
- You work for them.
- They're stockholders?

411
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,484
<i>They will be when they turn 25.</i>

412
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:09,653
I'm supposed to be giving them a
tour of the building right now,

413
00:18:09,704 --> 00:18:12,656
but I just know they're gonna pass by
a monitor with coverage from Boston

414
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,959
and one of them's gonna say,
"Oh, God, I just can't watch that.

415
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,878
It makes me too depressed."
And I'm gonna put their heads in a wall.

416
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,831
So I'm hiding in here.

417
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,600
Why here?

418
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:29,840
This is embargoed
until it crosses the tape.

419
00:18:30,638 --> 00:18:34,311
We're gonna miss our earnings
projections by a little.

420
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:43,854
By a little?

421
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,823
Did the Titanic miss New
York Harbor by a little?

422
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,942
- Feel free to pile on.
- You guys reaffirmed your guidance

423
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,660
- for the quarter a month ago.
- I know.

424
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:52,162
How could you do that if you knew
the numbers were gonna be this bad?

425
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:55,199
Qantas and Lufthansa decided they wanted to
use Rolls-Royce engines in their new Boeings.

426
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,867
- How did they keep that a secret?
- I don't know.

427
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,787
The message I want to get out
is that this is a one-time thing

428
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,006
and it's not gonna impact
our full-year guidance.

429
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,374
We're on track to meet
our final numbers.

430
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,593
This is just
a bump in the road.

431
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:07,261
You know I can't
carry your water.

432
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:08,846
I'm not asking you to.
I'm just asking you

433
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,681
to look at the big picture
and take it easy on us.

434
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,216
The big picture is
we're gonna be down

435
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,468
three to five points
by the end of the week.

436
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,853
Three to five?

437
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,895
All right,
it was fun talking to you.

438
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,070
I know everyone on this floor
thinks I'm an asshole,

439
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:35,739
but I run a good company.

440
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,875
And that's all
I've ever wanted to do...

441
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,160
Run a good company
that makes good products.

442
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,879
And we may have a political
difference on this,

443
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:44,915
but I take a lot of pride
in being a job creator.

444
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,417
Okay.

445
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,168
You really want to argue
the indisputable fact

446
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:51,005
that I cut paychecks
to 141,000 people?

447
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,257
Our difference of opinion isn't political,
it's religious.

448
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:54,808
I'm an economist,
and in my church

449
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,810
it's your customers
who are the job creators.

450
00:19:56,845 --> 00:19:58,429
And no one here thinks
you're an asshole.

451
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,482
- Really?
- I do.

452
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:03,600
Way to be up fourth
with Boston.

453
00:20:03,652 --> 00:20:05,352
I swear to God,
my Aunt Isadora,

454
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,071
who is in a nursing
home and blind,

455
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,273
called me with the news
before it was on our air.

456
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:12,026
If Mac allowed us to use
Aunt Isadora as a source...

457
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,194
- What was that about?
- It's embargoed.

458
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,946
How was breakfast?

459
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:18,666
Well, I left the tag on the clothes I
wore out of Brooks Brothers this morning.

460
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,452
- We're not good at this.
- And she tried to give me a message in a bottle.

461
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:22,753
What was it?

462
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:24,004
Merrill's media buyer
is gonna lose his job

463
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,622
because he's been
having an affair

464
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,092
with his 24-year-old assistant,
who used to be a circus performer.

465
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,843
Oh.

466
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:33,297
That was
an involuntary response

467
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:35,049
you'd get from any man
if he pictured a circus girl.

468
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,433
Pictured her doing what?

469
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,435
Why would she want
you to know this?

470
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,305
My guess is Goldman and Merrill
are competing to do a deal

471
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:43,357
and she'd like me to weaken
the competition for her.

472
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,810
The puzzle is, who's buying who?
And I like puzzles.

473
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:49,480
- No, you don't.
- I love puzzles.

474
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:52,116
You literally talk back to the
<i>New York Times</i> crossword. You yell at it.

475
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,985
Can I tell you something about the
<i>New York Times</i> crossword?

476
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:58,322
Very often they put the wrong number
of boxes in to house the correct word.

477
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,240
- Yeah.
- But this one I'm gonna solve

478
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,126
'cause I have
my Bloomberg terminal.

479
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,828
Tell me again what you get for
$24,000 that I don't get for 1,500?

480
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:08,215
- You wouldn't understand.
- Really?

481
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:11,585
You know how there are tall women
who don't mind dating shorter guys?

482
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:14,588
I don't mind that you're dumb.
And, Don, I mean that.

483
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:16,306
Thank you.

484
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,175
Can you tag Will out
for a while?

485
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,644
He's got to eat something.
Jim will catch you up on where we are right now.

486
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:24,064
- Where are we?
- Exactly where we were 12 hours ago.

487
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,203
<i>I'm gonna give us a soft
B-plus for the first day.</i>

488
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:32,072
Jenna!
I thought it was a solid B-plus.

489
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:34,608
- I'll tell you where we lost points.
- Yes?

490
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:37,528
I'm almost certain I asked for French toast,
scrambled eggs, and bacon

491
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,747
with a side order of bacon
and a Dr. Pepper.

492
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:41,615
- You did.
<i>- What do we have here?</i>

493
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,584
Greek yogurt,
a gluten-free muffin,

494
00:21:43,618 --> 00:21:46,537
two hard-boiled eggs,
one-third of a banana, and green tea.

495
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:48,539
You're taking instructions from her,
aren't you?

496
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,841
I've always been taking
instructions from her.

497
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,709
And you are looking
at nothing out the window.

498
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,511
Listen up.
I'm from Nebraska.

499
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,964
I'm not like the rest of you.
I can eat food without fear.

500
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,550
Why did Greek yogurt suddenly become...
Never mind.

501
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,554
Did we overuse
the B-roll yesterday?

502
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,005
I didn't think so.
Did you?

503
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,690
Just keep an eye on the
smoke and people running.

504
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:09,359
- Why soft?
- Ryan Guidry on the DC desk

505
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,679
signed off with an affiliate stringer
by telling him to stay safe.

506
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:16,366
God damn it. He's not in the Sudan!
He's in Beacon Hill!

507
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,985
I agree that it's infuriating.

508
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,286
I don't care if there's
a shoulder-mounted,

509
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,239
rocket-propelled grenade
launcher pointed at his face.

510
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,374
I don't want anyone telling
anyone to stay safe.

511
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,326
- Do we have to point out how transparent...
- I will take him off the air...

512
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:28,328
- ...and manipulative that is?
- ...just long enough to pummel him

513
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:30,414
- with a snow shovel.
- Creating the illusion of a cast of characters

514
00:22:30,465 --> 00:22:32,749
- who are in peril, so don't touch that dial...
- The last words he hears

515
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,434
- before his bruised and bloody head goes back on TV...
- because suddenly you might,

516
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:36,086
- you know, blow up.
- ...will be "Stay safe."

517
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,754
- You guys about done?
- Yeah.

518
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:40,591
Good. You're both idiots.
Rundown meeting.

519
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,977
All in all,
I think we're doing well.

520
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,597
I'm still trying to figure out
exactly what doing well means.

521
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,116
You know what it means.
Let's go.

522
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:57,608
- Jim.
- The source won't go on record yet,

523
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,410
but from everything she's seen,
she's sure it was a pressure cooker bomb.

524
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,995
If she's sure,
why isn't she going on the record?

525
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,532
And the FBI has a picture of someone
taking video at the finish line

526
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,501
at the time of the explosion,
so they're trying to identify that person.

527
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:09,837
- Got it. Gary?
- Vigils are planned tonight

528
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:11,538
at Harvard Memorial
Church in Cambridge,

529
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:13,290
Parkman Bandstand
in Boston Common,

530
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:15,125
and for the little boy
at Garvey Park in Dorchester.

531
00:23:15,176 --> 00:23:17,628
No, I repeat,
no interviews with children.

532
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,296
What's the desk schedule?

533
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:21,882
1:00 and then DC takes
a three-hour block.

534
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,801
Neal, tell us what's going on
with the nocturnal nut brigade.

535
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:28,472
Somebody's trying to give me
classified government documents.

536
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:35,812
Somebody asked
for my encryption key.

537
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:37,781
That's not uncommon, is it?

538
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:40,651
No, but then they asked for a
higher level of encryption.

539
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,152
Less common,
but not unprecedented.

540
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,037
We use a site, CryptoHeaven,
which is for...

541
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:47,658
- Nerds.
- Yeah, and he told me to get an air-gapped computer.

542
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,227
- It's a computer that's...
- Never been connected to the Internet.

543
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:52,713
There's literally a gap of air between
the computer and the rest of the world.

544
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:55,165
It's what I imagine the afterlife
is like if you've been good.

545
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,050
Once I do that,
he's gonna give me a flash drive.

546
00:23:57,085 --> 00:23:58,835
How's he gonna get it to you?

547
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:02,055
I know you guys think I live
in a world of crackpots,

548
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,007
and I'll grant you
there's a troubling

549
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:05,759
normal-to-crackpot ratio
on my end of the field...

550
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,644
How's he gonna get you
the flash drive, Neal?

551
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,980
He's gonna tape it inside the tank of
a toilet in a restaurant men's room.

552
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:11,732
Bull's-eye.

553
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:14,518
- I think he's real.
- Why?

554
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,603
He's paranoid.

555
00:24:16,654 --> 00:24:18,355
<i>Well, why didn't you say so?</i>

556
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:21,959
I was skeptical before,
but now that I know your source has a mental illness...

557
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,577
Anything else?

558
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:24,912
Good.

559
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,097
Neal.

560
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,386
Go buy an air-gapped
computer.

561
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,556
Thank you.

562
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,616
The homemade bombs
are considered

563
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,452
improvised explosive devices,
or IEDs.

564
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:07,738
<i>It's created by
inserting materials...</i>

565
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:10,490
Nails, ball bearings, glass...
into a pressure cooker.

566
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,659
<i>- Just to be clear...</i>
- You're coming to the top of the hour.

567
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,261
Let's hand off to John in DC.

568
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:15,746
It's what you would buy
at a Crate & Barrel.

569
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,332
And the fragmentation
of the pressure cooker itself

570
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,417
<i>creates lethal shrapnel
when ignited</i>

571
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:22,970
<i>using a simple electronic
device like a digital watch.</i>

572
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:25,922
<i>You know what, sir?
I'm sorry, I'd rather not give out the recipe.</i>

573
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,426
<i>Unfortunately, the recipe and the
ingredients are readily available.</i>

574
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:31,845
<i>Nabil Chatilla,
FBI counterterrorism expert.</i>

575
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,430
<i>- Split 'em.</i>
<i>- It's 4:00 in the East</i>

576
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,232
<i>when you'd normally be seeing</i>
Market Wrap-up<i> with me,</i>

577
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:37,734
<i>but we'll send it to
Washington and John Bingham</i>

578
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,487
<i>for more continuing coverage
of the tragedy in Boston.</i>

579
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:43,440
<i>And I'll let you know how the markets
reacted later tonight. John?</i>

580
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:45,075
- You're out.
<i>- Thanks, Sloan.</i>

581
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:50,614
I spoke to a source at B of A,
and he couldn't tell me much,

582
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:52,749
but he did say the private
equity's from out of town.

583
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,368
Great. Good lead.
Good work.

584
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,536
- You don't know what I'm talking about, right?
- No.

585
00:25:56,587 --> 00:25:58,455
My puzzle.
Somebody's buying somebody.

586
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,390
So I made a list of the
out-of-town heavy hitters.

587
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,959
Gary!
TGP Capital, Oaktree,

588
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:05,462
Lone Star Funds, Golden State,
Silver Lake, Sequoia.

589
00:26:05,513 --> 00:26:07,631
- Yeah?
- I have a list of 24 private equity firms

590
00:26:07,682 --> 00:26:11,351
and I'd like to find out if anyone has
checked into a hotel in the last 72 hours.

591
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:14,137
There are 106,000
hotel rooms in New York.

592
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,972
No, they'll be staying
at a high-end hotel.

593
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:18,108
The Four Seasons,
The Carlyle, the Regency,

594
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:19,993
Ritz-Carlton,
Mark, Mercer,

595
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,229
Soho Grand, Gramercy,
Peninsula...

596
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,980
Yeah,
I'm a little busy with Boston.

597
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,982
I meant, you know how
after a 16 or 18-hour shift,

598
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,484
you like to unwind
with a little work?

599
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:28,985
- The tail numbers.
- What's that?

600
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,654
- They came on a private jet, right?
- Probably.

601
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:33,323
They either landed at Teterboro or White Plains.
Follow the tail numbers.

602
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,960
- Decent tip.
- Mm-hmm.

603
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:40,297
<i>...with CNN's John King
reporting a few minutes ago</i>

604
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:42,249
<i>that an arrest has been made.</i>

605
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,667
<i>We have no confirmation
of this,</i>

606
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:46,002
<i>but again,
CNN's John King is reporting...</i>

607
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,754
<i>John King's reporting
an arrest's been made.</i>

608
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:49,639
<i>Do we have
a second confirmation?</i>

609
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,391
Nobody has
a second confirmation.

610
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:54,010
This man doesn't make
a lot of mistakes.

611
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,596
There are more reporters in the
city right now than Celtics fans.

612
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:59,349
I don't see how they could have made
an arrest without anybody noticing.

613
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,518
Get a second source.

614
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:05,021
Find out where
he's getting this,

615
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,858
'cause somebody's talking
to him who isn't talking to us.

616
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:15,248
Okay, thank you.

617
00:27:15,283 --> 00:27:17,000
Savannah Capital.

618
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:18,785
Yeah, you're supposed
to be sleeping right now.

619
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:20,287
I will,
but Savannah Capital's in town.

620
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,788
You want me to put
a reporter on this?

621
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,874
- I am a reporter.
- An investigative reporter.

622
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,542
I don't want to take someone
off something important.

623
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:27,377
I can do this.
I get information all the time.

624
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,346
You get information
people want you to have.

625
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,881
I'm gonna call my good
friend Lionel Barkley,

626
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,549
CEO of Savannah Capital.

627
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,551
And he's not gonna
tell you anything, right?

628
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:37,471
- I wouldn't think so.
- You don't want the CEO.

629
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,055
You want a low-level guy
who wants to impress you

630
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,557
by demonstrating
he's in the loop.

631
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:43,059
- I don't know low-level people.
- You teach.

632
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:45,395
Isn't it possible one of your
bloodless business students...

633
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,731
Is a low-level analyst at Savannah?
Yes, sir.

634
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:49,633
Jacob Geitfreund.

635
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,318
Sent me an email
a few months ago.

636
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,903
He'd been promoted
from the mail room.

637
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,404
The result
of a proper education.

638
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,123
The $24,000 computer
doesn't hold phone numbers?

639
00:27:56,157 --> 00:27:57,741
<i>Savannah Capital.</i>

640
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:00,076
- Jacob Geitfreund, please.
<i>- Transferring.</i>

641
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,412
Very good student,
but he likes puns too much.

642
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,798
- Well, praise his blog.
- How do you know he has a blog?

643
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:07,584
- My phone can Google things.
- I don't like puns.

644
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,419
- <i>That wasn't a pun.</i>
- I'm saying in general.

645
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,087
<i>Jacob Geitfreund's office.</i>

646
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,006
Hi, this is Sloan Sabbith
calling for Jacob.

647
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:14,758
<i>Just a moment, please.
I'll see if he's in.</i>

648
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:16,643
Sometimes puns can be punny.

649
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:18,845
- What'd I just say?
<i>- Professor Sabbith?</i>

650
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:21,932
Jacob, you don't have to call me
professor anymore. It's Sloan.

651
00:28:21,983 --> 00:28:23,934
- <i>Got it.</i>
- I love your blog.

652
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,435
<i>Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.</i>

653
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,271
- <i>I didn't know you read it.</i>
- God, everybody does.

654
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,908
I was thinking about doing
a 30 under 30 package

655
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,244
for top analysts and you'd
be perfect for that.

656
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,196
<i>Wow, that sounds great.
I've love to, yeah.</i>

657
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,081
- <i>Is that why you're calling?</i>
- Not this time.

658
00:28:38,115 --> 00:28:41,284
Right now I'm calling because your
firm is doing a media deal in town

659
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,286
and I wanted to see if I could
get you on deep background.

660
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,922
<i>Hey, you're the one who told us in class
that one of the perks of teaching</i>

661
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,041
<i>is that you can cultivate young,
unwitting sources.</i>

662
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:50,343
- And that's you.
<i>- Yeah, I know the deal you're talking about.</i>

663
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,712
<i>I can't talk about it.
You know, Sloan...</i>

664
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:55,382
- Yeah?
<i>- Are you seeing anyone?</i>

665
00:28:58,686 --> 00:29:01,054
- Nope.
<i>- Well, I can tell you it's a big deal.</i>

666
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:02,606
<i>You're going to be interested.</i>

667
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,308
- How big?
<i>- Well, I guess it's all relative.</i>

668
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,394
Hang on a second.
He's using puns.

669
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,612
He's talking about
sex right now.

670
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,779
That wasn't a pun.
It was a double enten...

671
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:10,981
<i>Thanks for holding.</i>

672
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,566
You mean the size
of the deal is relative?

673
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,818
<i>Sure. Look, if you want to get together privately</i>

674
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,320
<i>and talk about the 30 under 30
segment you mentioned...</i>

675
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:20,156
- What's going on down there?
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

676
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:21,658
I'm gonna call you back.

677
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,294
<i>Not able to get any
more details at the moment,</i>

678
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:27,130
<i>but CNN is now retracting
its earlier report</i>

679
00:29:27,164 --> 00:29:29,165
<i>that an arrest
had been made in Boston.</i>

680
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,917
- What happened?
- CNN had to retract.

681
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:32,469
<i>No arrest has been made.</i>

682
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:35,338
<i>Once again,
our own John King...</i>

683
00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:37,340
Hey!

684
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:39,926
Hey!

685
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:42,846
What are you doing?

686
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:45,882
Worst moment in this guy's
life and you're cheering?

687
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,067
- Why?
- Why?

688
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:49,269
<i>Because you think
if someone gets in line</i>

689
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,820
in back of you,
it means the line moved?

690
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:53,023
- We still blew Genoa.
- The line didn't move.

691
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,492
- And if there's anyone in the world...
- That's right.

692
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:58,828
...who should be able to empathize
with CNN right now, you would think...

693
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,281
- Wouldn't you?
- ...that it would be the people in this room.

694
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,501
- Empathy.
- He got knocked down.

695
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:08,371
You didn't get taller.

696
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,757
- Sorry, Charlie.
- Sorry.

697
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:17,213
- Dodged a fucking bullet there.
- No kidding.

698
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,850
The MSG is where
the flavor comes from.

699
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,937
The Chinese are a people who have
been around for billions of years.

700
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:26,056
No people have been around
for billions of years.

701
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,191
Okay, well, some of us have
read a book called the Bible,

702
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:30,944
which is pretty clear
about the Chinese and MSG.

703
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:33,280
Listen,
I will live a life of flavorless food

704
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:34,781
if that's what it takes
to be married to you,

705
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:36,483
but couldn't you give me
a different test?

706
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:37,984
General knowledge
or air hockey?

707
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:41,304
As soon as the life
insurance policy vests.

708
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,073
Hard B-plus
for the third day.

709
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,574
I think we're getting
our juju back.

710
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:47,077
- What do you think?
- You ever read Euripides?

711
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:49,746
Yeah.
I read it when I was in...

712
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:51,915
No, fuck you.
I haven't read Euripides.

713
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,918
In the first act of the story,
you chase the heroes up a tree.

714
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:57,087
In the second act,
you throw rocks at them.

715
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,639
And in the third act,
they get themselves down.

716
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:01,925
I think we're getting
ourselves down from the tree.

717
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,764
- It's Maggie.
- Put her on speaker.

718
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:10,066
Hey, Maggie.
You've got Will here, too.

719
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,434
Listen, I'm at the precinct.

720
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:13,236
<i>I thought you were
staking out City Hall.</i>

721
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,771
That's where everybody else is.

722
00:31:14,822 --> 00:31:16,489
'Cause that's where the news
is gonna be coming from.

723
00:31:16,524 --> 00:31:18,692
<i>Then I won't have any
trouble hearing about it.</i>

724
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:21,578
<i>I've been talking with a desk sergeant,
a woman in her early 30s.</i>

725
00:31:21,612 --> 00:31:23,613
She was crying a little
and we got to talking

726
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:25,782
and I think I know
what happened to John King.

727
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,751
That's not really
the story we're chasing.

728
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:31,004
Yeah, but I just thought you should
know in an entirely unrelated incident,

729
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,873
the Boston PD was
disseminating disinformation

730
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:36,209
to a handful of detectives
to try to find a leak.

731
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,711
King's source was one of them.

732
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,629
Why was
the desk sergeant crying?

733
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,965
<i>Her detective husband
had just been suspended</i>

734
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:43,933
<i>pending an investigation
into a leak.</i>

735
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,302
- You have a second source?
- I don't even have a first source.

736
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,521
She wouldn't confirm it,
but I'm pretty sure I'm right.

737
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,106
<i>Prove it and we'll
help a brother out.</i>

738
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,392
But I don't like when
the media covers the media.

739
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,277
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- See?

740
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:56,730
Act one,
John King gets chased up a tree.

741
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,898
Act two,
everyone throws rocks at him.

742
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:01,718
I completely understood
the story the first time.

743
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:03,492

The Boston Police Department and
the US Department of Justice

745
00:32:06,657 --> 00:32:08,908
would like you to know that
this headline is incorrect

746
00:32:08,959 --> 00:32:11,127
<i>and that the two men
pictured here are not suspects</i>

747
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,662
<i>in the Boston Marathon bombing.</i>

748
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:15,999
And I'll bet the two men pictured
here would <i>really</i> like you to know

749
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,551
that they're not suspects
in the Boston Marathon bombing.

750
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:29,763
- Yes, sir?
- I'd just like to use your restroom.

751
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,648
The restroom
is for our customers.

752
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:33,683
Can I get some takeout?

753
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:35,351
<i>Sure, what would you like?</i>

754
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:37,687
What's the least expensive
thing you have on the menu?

755
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,573
- Go use the restroom.
- Thank you.

756
00:33:49,426 --> 00:33:51,227
<i>Welcome back to our
continued coverage</i>

757
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,762
<i>of the Boston Marathon manhunt.</i>

758

<i>ACN reporter Elliot Hirsch
is in Watertown. Elliot?</i>

759
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,801
<i>Will, over the last few hours,
a series of dramatic events</i>

760
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,770
<i>have unfolded on the streets
of suburban Boston.</i>

761
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,773
As of this moment,
one police officer at MIT is dead

762
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:06,025
as is one of the two
bombing suspects,

763
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:09,112
who was killed in a car chase and
a shoot-out with law enforcement.

764
00:34:09,163 --> 00:34:10,947
The other suspect
remains at large.

765
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:17,337
<i>Police units
searched door-to-door</i>

766
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:19,789
<i>over a 20-block area
here in Watertown.</i>

767
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,126
<i>The entire city of Boston is on
lockdown as the manhunt continues.</i>

768
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,761
<i>Do we know
the circumstances surrounding</i>

769
00:34:24,795 --> 00:34:27,463
<i>the MIT officer's death?
Was there a motive?</i>

770
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:29,549
<i>The shooting is still
under active investigation,</i>

771
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,353
<i>but we know he was shot during a
confrontation with the two suspects.</i>

772
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:36,472
<i>Campus surveillance footage is
currently being reviewed as we speak.</i>

773
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,192
<i>What details can you tell us
about the lockdown in effect?</i>

774
00:34:39,226 --> 00:34:41,528
<i>The Boston Police
Department is asking residents</i>

775
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:44,147
<i>to stay inside and not
to answer their doors</i>

776
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,033
<i>unless instructed by
a uniformed police officer.</i>

777
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:48,868
<i>Public transportation
has been suspended</i>

778
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:52,655
<i>and authorities told people at closed
stops and stations to go home.</i>

779
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,791
<i>No vehicle traffic
is allowed in Watertown</i>

780
00:34:54,825 --> 00:34:57,610
<i>and a no-fly zone
is in place over the city.</i>

781
00:34:57,645 --> 00:34:59,379
<i>How many people
has this affected?</i>

782
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:03,399
<i>About 32,000 Watertown

791

Sunil Tripathi
was a student at Brown.

792
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:46,843
He was reported missing
about a month ago.

793
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:48,461
His family set up
a Facebook page

794
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:51,047
for anyone who might have
information about where he is.

795
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,967
Now, yesterday at 5:00 P.M.
in response to Thursday's <i>Post</i> front page

796
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:57,887
misidentifying two innocent
people as enemies of the state,

797
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,406
the FBI issued these photos
of the actual suspects.

798
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:02,025
<i>Now, here's what happened next.</i>

799
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,443
Within minutes,
users on Reddit...

800
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:05,728
All got together and decided
that the best thing to do

801
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:08,648
was to step back and let the
professionals do their jobs.

802
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,733
They began comparing
the FBI photo

803
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,735
of one of the suspects
to Sunil Tripathi.

804
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:15,538
By 10:00 P.M.,
it had become a leading theory on Reddit

805
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,490
that Tripathi
was suspect number two.

806
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:20,243
At 2:43 this morning,
a man named Greg Hughes

807
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,712
<i>tweeted that the Boston
Police scanner had identified</i>

808
00:36:22,746 --> 00:36:25,732
the names of the suspects as
Mike Mulugeta and Sunil Tripathi.

809
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,334
Earlier in the night
Greg Hughes had tweeted, "In 2013,

810
00:36:28,385 --> 00:36:30,303
all you need is a connection
to the Boston Police scanner

811
00:36:30,337 --> 00:36:32,088
<i>and a Twitter feed
to know what's up.</i>

812
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:33,723
<i>We don't even need
TV anymore."</i>

813
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:35,558
Now he tells me.
I just bought a new plasma.

814
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:37,677
- How big?
- 28 inches, baby. The whole ride.

815
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,262
Seven minutes after
the Greg Hughes tweet,

816
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:42,598
Kevin Galliford,
a cameraman for Hartford's CBS affiliate,

817
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,818
picks up on the Hughes tweet and he relays
the same information to his followers.

818
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:48,021
Moments after that,
a reporter at BuzzFeed

819
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,573
sends a tweet out
to his 81,000 followers.

820
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:53,443
A reporter at BuzzFeed
has 81,000 followers?

821
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,278
- How many do you have?
- One. Him.

822
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,447
She's funny.
I like her jokes.

823
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,615
- I follow you.
- I'm not on Twitter.

824
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,167
- Really?
- Really.

825
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:03,119
- I wonder who I've been following.
- Guys, please.

826
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,788
The BuzzFeed tweet says,
"Wow, Reddit was right.

827
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,957
Suspect identified
as Sunil Tripathi."

828
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,293
Two questions...
Do we know who Greg Hughes is?

829
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:11,427
He's a guy on Reddit.

830
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,429
Second question
is that by this point,

831
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:17,100
at 2:43 this morning, has anyone at our
network checked on Sunil Tripathi?

832
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,335
- Of course we have.
- And?

833
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,471
Five senior officials
with the FBI,

834
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:24,357
three with the Justice Department including
one from the Attorney General's office,

835
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:26,142
another five
from the Boston PD,

836
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,311
<i>all of them willing to be
identified on the record,</i>

837
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:32,198
all of them categorically denying
that Sunil Tripathi is a suspect.

838
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:34,150
Also the Secretary
of Homeland Security.

839
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,819
When you put their certainty up
against Greg Hughes' certainty,

840
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,237
I don't know who the hell
to believe.

841
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:40,656
2:57 A.M.,
14 minutes after the first tweet,

842
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:44,961
an NBC News correspondent tweets
the Sunil Tripathi theory

843
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:47,080
<i>to his 180,000 followers.</i>

844
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,831
180,000?

845
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:50,500
At least it's been
downgraded to a theory.

846
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:52,251
A half hour later,
Perez Hilton sends it out.

847
00:37:52,302 --> 00:37:54,303
<i>- I don't even want to know.</i>
- Six million.

848
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,740
<i>The Internet celebrates that
Reddit has solved the bombing.</i>

849
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,426
John King is a stooge.
The <i>Post</i> is irresponsible.

850
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:02,178
And the FBI is inept.

851
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:04,514
- Is that it?
- No.

852
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:06,516
Between 3:00 A.M.
and 4:15 A.M.,

853
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:09,152
Tripathi's sister receives
58 calls on her cell.

854
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,854
- Maggie's listened to them.
- Really?

855
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:14,524
About half the messages
are reporters

856
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:16,826
calling for a comment
on her missing brother

857
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,444
being named a suspect
in the bombing,

858
00:38:18,495 --> 00:38:20,863
the other half are death threats,
and of those,

859
00:38:20,914 --> 00:38:22,698
<i>close to two-thirds
include rape.</i>

860
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,917
<i>Death threats also start
to fill the Facebook page</i>

861
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:26,619
- <i>the Tripathis had set up to find...</i>
- Jenna!

862
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,504
- I agree.
<i>- That's why we're telling you this.</i>

863
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,289
<i>Now they've taken down
the page which Reddit users</i>

864
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,925
- <i>saw as evidence of guilt instead of the result...</i>
- Get me on the air.

865
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,794
- I need a suit.
- It's being cleaned and pressed.

866
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,546
There's a whole room full of suits;
I can wear any one of them.

867
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,598
You're nine feet tall.
You can't wear any one of them.

868
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:40,216
I think she's starting to get
the hang of this place.

869
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,051
Saw as evidence of guilt instead
of the hundreds of threats

870
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:44,020
of public lynchings, beheadings,
and bullets to the head

871
00:38:44,054 --> 00:38:46,355
of family members as well
as the anti-Muslim messages.

872
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,558
- Out of curiosity...
- Are the Tripathis Muslim?

873
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,892
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- No.

874
00:38:49,894 --> 00:38:51,861
Well done, faceless mob.

875
00:38:51,895 --> 00:38:53,229
Let's go.

876
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,781
<i>...was killed
early this morning</i>

877
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:56,899
while the second one
remains at large.

878
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,152
Again, the FBI has announced
that the suspects

879
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,404
are the brothers
Tamerlan and Jahar Tsarnaev.

880
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:04,407
<i>Because we prefer not to make
celebrities out of these men,</i>

881
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:06,959
we'll be referring to them
on ACN as the suspects.

882
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:08,578
But right now
we want you to know

883
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:12,515
that no one is a suspect but
Tamerlan and Jahar Tsarnaev.

884
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:14,500
You're up in six minutes.

885
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:16,302
- Thanks for the food.
- Sure.

886
00:39:16,336 --> 00:39:17,970
This is great chicken salad.

887
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:19,305
There's some cookies
in the bag, too.

888
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:20,890
They have walnuts.
I'm allergic.

889
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,675
The chicken salad has walnuts.

890
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:24,760
What are you talking about?

891
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:27,597
The chicken salad you're eating
right now has walnuts in it.

892
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,683
- These things are walnuts?
- What did you think they were?

893
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:33,069
I don't...
I wasn't thinking what...

894
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:36,439
When did walnuts start
going into chicken salad?

895
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,441
- Are you gonna be okay?
- No.

896
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:40,359
Here's what's gonna happen.
In about a minute,

897
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,496
my tongue is going
to swell up like a bassoon.

898
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,781
- A bassoon?
- A bathoon.

899
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,034
- A bathoon.
- A balloon.

900
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,119
All right, uh,
we have to pull the story.

901
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,338
- No, it's a good thory.
- Not anymore, Elliot.

902
00:39:52,372 --> 00:39:54,423
Do you need an EpiPen
or a hospital?

903
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,125
You do it.
You do the thory.

904
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:58,461
- You have the faths.
- The facts?

905
00:39:58,512 --> 00:40:00,463
Yeth.

906
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:02,965
Look at me.
I can't go on camera.

907
00:40:03,016 --> 00:40:05,852
- What, Marie Antoinette's clothes?
- Leth's go.

908
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:07,436
- Leth's go.
- Okay... Calm down.

909
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,138
Uh...

910
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,941
makeup, passport.

911
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:14,477
What emergency
does she need these for?

912
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,028
Breaking news at the Met gala?

913
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:17,313
I'm calling the thudio.

914
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,398
- I think you should let me do that.
<i>- Hmm?</i>

915
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:21,567
- Give me the phone.
- Yeah, you got it.

916
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:38,197
_

917
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,738
All right, coming to you in 30.

918
00:40:58,772 --> 00:41:00,273
- 30?
- 30.

919
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,441
- I can't tell...
- 30! No Ss.

920
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:04,026
- No Ss in 30.
- 30.

921
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,695
<i>Well, not anymore.</i>

922
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,079
Maggie?

923
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:09,081
<i>Yeah, Jim.
I can hear you.</i>

924
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:10,416
This is Jim.
Can you hear me?

925
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,585
Yeah, I can.
Can you not hear me?

926
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:15,538
Yes, yeah. You were one question ahead.
Here's Mac.

927
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:20,209
If you get a stain on the dress,
club soda and salt,

928
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,044
<i>but it has to be right away
and you have to tell</i>

929
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:23,763
the dry cleaner
that under no circumstance...

930
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:25,965
You know what?
Let's do this after.

931
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,884
- You think?
- Stand by.

932
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:32,104
Intro and then
take us to Boston.

933
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:34,106
<i>Contact authorities
immediately.</i>

934
00:41:34,141 --> 00:41:37,093
FBI spokesperson Angela Brand,
thank you.

935
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:39,445
Earlier today,
ACN producer Maggie Jordan

936
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:43,199
<i>was able to track down a former wrestling
teammate of the second suspect.</i>

937
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,901
<i>The young man was not willing
to go in front of our cameras,</i>

938
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,454
<i>nor was he willing
to let us reveal his name,</i>

939
00:41:48,488 --> 00:41:50,289
<i>but ACN's confirmed
his authenticity</i>

940
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:53,576
<i>and Maggie Jordan is standing
by in Boston for this report.</i>

941
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,378
<i>Maggie?</i>

942
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,663
<i>Will, earlier today,
we were able to find</i>

943
00:41:57,714 --> 00:41:59,749
<i>a 20-year-old man
whom we'll call Joe,</i>

944
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:02,835
<i>but as you mentioned in your intro,
that's not his real name.</i>

945
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:05,638
<i>We found him by going through
a series of Facebook friends</i>

946
00:42:05,672 --> 00:42:08,171
<i>and confirmed his identity and
his connection to the suspects</i>

947
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,527
<i>using his driver's license,
high school photos</i>

948
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,279
<i>from Cambridge Rindge
and Latin,</i>

949
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,365
<i>and sources inside
the State Board of Education.</i>

950
00:42:14,416 --> 00:42:17,084
How did Joe describe
the second suspect?

951
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,919
<i>"A super chill guy.</i>

952
00:42:18,954 --> 00:42:21,255
<i>Liked soccer, hip-hop,
and girls.</i>

953
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,707
<i>He obsessed over </i>The Walking Dead
<i>and </i>Game of Thrones<i>."</i>

954
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:25,559
<i>That sounds like
a lot of people.</i>

955
00:42:25,594 --> 00:42:27,628
<i>It does,
but here's the part that separates him.</i>

956
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,432
<i>Joe said,
"He thought 9/11 was justified</i>

957
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,217
<i>because of what the US does
in other countries</i>

958
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:36,553
<i>and that they do it so frequently,
dropping bombs all the time."</i>

959
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:39,723
<i>I want to be clear,
I'm quoting Joe, not the suspect.</i>

960
00:42:39,774 --> 00:42:41,892
<i>It was a second-party
characterization.</i>

961
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:44,945
ACN's Maggie Jordan
reporting from Boston.

962
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,333
When we come back, more coverage from
the Boston bombing investigation.

963
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,201
Clear.

964
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,488
Yeth.
Yeth! Yeth!

965
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,490
- He's saying yes.
- I know.

966
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:58,542
<i>...two male
suspects they are seeking</i>

967
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,377
<i>in conjunction
with the bombing.</i>

968
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:03,664
<i>They have not been
apprehended at this time.</i>

969
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:07,167
Is it just me,
or did she age 10 years this week?

970
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:09,420
I, um...

971
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:12,473
Yeah.

972
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:27,187
Hey.

973
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,273
What are you doing out here?

974
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:31,275
It's a nice night.

975
00:43:31,326 --> 00:43:33,360
What do you want to talk about?

976
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,362
I thought you guys
did great this week.

977
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:38,282
My head's held high.
It's a good feeling.

978
00:43:38,284 --> 00:43:41,368
- I've seen the numbers.
- I haven't.

979
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,923
Did we drop to third?

980
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,292
Fourth.

981
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,512
Fourth?

982
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:57,384
Fourth. Hmm.

983
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:00,721
I've always been able to live with second.

984
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:03,774
I mean, I get that.
Our motto around here is go for the silver.

985
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:05,442
But fourth?

986
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:09,396
We did everything right.
We did everything right.

987
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,315
You think because
we went up late...

988
00:44:11,366 --> 00:44:13,317
Look, I didn't ask you to come out
here to berate you about numbers.

989
00:44:13,368 --> 00:44:16,537
Those days are over.
I want you to do the news well.

990
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,623
But your power
comes from your ratings.

991
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,825
And the autonomy of the news
division comes from your power.

992
00:44:21,827 --> 00:44:23,660
You're not gonna be able
to do the stories you want.

993
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:25,129
You're not gonna be able
to say whatever you want.

994
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:28,132
And, frankly, you're not gonna
be able to stay on the air

995
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,834
because my mother and I can
only protect you from the board

996
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:33,754
if you're making money.

997
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,596
Well, I think it's time
for me to quit.

998
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:52,146
_

999
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,870
Let's do sports, Charlie.
We love sports.

1000
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,923
You mean, like,
try out for a team?

1001
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:12,209
Do not mean try out
for a team, no.

1002
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:15,212
- Excuse me.
- Neal.

1003
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:16,930
What do you need?

1004
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,132
I need to talk
to the two of you.

1005
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:20,050
I can't find Jim or Mac or Don.

1006
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:22,219
Go ahead.

1007
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,138
Is it all right in front of...

1008
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:26,106
Yeah, what is it?

1009
00:45:28,276 --> 00:45:30,027
I'm currently in possession
of a little more

1010
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:32,396
than 27,000 stolen
government documents.

1011
00:45:32,398 --> 00:45:34,281
About half of them classified.

1012
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,203
Yeah, I'm just gonna
jump off this railing.

1013
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,571
You'll have experts
authenticate them,

1014
00:45:40,573 --> 00:45:42,039
but they're authentic.
This isn't Genoa.

1015
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,074
- What's in the documents?
- Hang on.

1016
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,577
It's Will.
Have Mac come out to the terrace.

1017
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:47,995
Go ahead.

1018
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:50,164
There's a PR firm
in Virginia called BCD.

1019
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:51,748
They do contract work
for SOCOM.

1020
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,084
- Propaganda?
- Hearts and minds, yeah.

1021
00:45:54,135 --> 00:45:55,335
They get stories
in foreign newspapers

1022
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:57,254
about American soldiers
doing community outreach.

1023
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:59,089
But it can go higher than that.

1024
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:01,592
They're helping King Abdullah
stay in power in Jordan.

1025
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:04,478
<i>And it can also
be disinformation.</i>

1026
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,513
A growing pro-democracy
rebellion in Kundu

1027
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,483
threatens stability in a region
that includes American interests,

1028
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,235
including national security.

1029
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:15,155
<i>To undermine the movement,
BCD put false stories in the local press</i>

1030
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,441
claiming that a rebel leader
was about to wage war

1031
00:46:17,492 --> 00:46:19,359
on another rebel group.

1032
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,912
Those false stories
caused riots last week

1033
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,665
that killed 38 people
including three Americans.

1034
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:32,673
Start at the beginning.

1035
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:41,602
_

1036
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:50,357
- Start again.
- I've told the story three times.

1037
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:53,310
Tell it again.

1038
00:46:53,312 --> 00:46:55,779
I'm contacted over our website by
someone who wants my encryption key.

1039
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,314
- I give it to him.
- How do you know it's a he?

1040
00:46:57,365 --> 00:46:59,399
I don't. I'm using the generic
term for an unknown person.

1041
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,236
I give it to him. He tells me he
wants a higher level of encryption

1042
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:04,071
and that I should
assume my adversary

1043
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:06,490
is capable of three trillion
guesses per second.

1044
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:08,709
I get him the higher
encryption and he tells me

1045
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,544
he's gonna hide a flash drive
for me at a restaurant

1046
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,580
and that I need to get an air-gapped
computer to view the flash drive.

1047
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,799
I view some of the contents
of the flash drive,

1048
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,751
but obviously not all because
there are 27,000 documents.

1049
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:21,505
I'm convinced by the little
I've read to tell him or her

1050
00:47:21,556 --> 00:47:24,174
that to convince my bosses
right away I'm gonna need more

1051
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:28,679
or something else and I remind him...
Them... About Genoa.

1052
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,681
Now, you should know
that the DOD

1053
00:47:30,683 --> 00:47:32,933
doesn't store documents on the
same Internet you and I use.

1054
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:34,902
They use a private network
known as SIPRNet...

1055
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,521
Secret Internet Protocol
Router Network.

1056
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:39,823
At first, he...
The source...

1057
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,692
Has trouble transferring
them from SIPRNet,

1058
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:43,994
so I tell him to try
using a CD-R and then...

1059
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,863
Stop.
You left out that part before.

1060
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:49,833
- What part?
- Where you asked for more documents.

1061
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,702
It's a lot of computerese
that doesn't matter.

1062
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:53,370
I didn't want
your eyes to glaze over.

1063
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:55,622
I wanted one or two pieces
I could show you

1064
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,207
so you'd okay
the cost of investigating.

1065
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:59,343
Did he give them to you,
the one or two pieces?

1066
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,428
Yes.

1067
00:48:05,934 --> 00:48:08,685
Neal, you induced him
to commit a felony.

1068
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,555
You conspired
to commit espionage.

1069
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:15,442
We were supposed to end the
week down three to five points.

1070
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,060
According to who?

1071
00:48:17,062 --> 00:48:18,729
Me.

1072
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:23,066
We missed the quarterly
targets and by a lot,

1073
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:25,569
but ended trading up
one and three...

1074
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,582
It was a pun.

1075
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:40,083
"It's all relative."

1076
00:48:40,134 --> 00:48:43,420
It wasn't a double entendre,
it was a pun.

1077
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,093
Should I just stay here?

1078
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,648
No.

1079
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:57,517
The moment you asked him to give
you stolen classified documents,

1080
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,270
you committed a federal crime.

1081
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:01,772
You don't have to scare him.
They're not gonna want him.

1082
00:49:01,774 --> 00:49:03,273
They're gonna want
the whistle-blower.

1083
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:05,192
How do you think they're gonna
get to the whistle-blower?

1084
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:07,277
What is everybody doing out...
Reese.

1085
00:49:07,328 --> 00:49:08,945
We're kind of in the
middle of something.

1086
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:10,364
When's their birthday,
the twins?

1087
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:11,698
Why don't we meet in my office?

1088
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,033
When's their birthday?

1089
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:14,785
- The party's tomorrow night.
- Not the party.

1090
00:49:14,836 --> 00:49:16,787
Their actual birthday.
When do they turn 25?

1091
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:19,423
I honestly don't...
Next week, the 25th or 26th.

1092
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,625
Get your mother on the phone.
She has to call the board into an emergency session.

1093
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:23,877
- Right now, tonight.
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

1094
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:25,846
You went to Wharton, Reese.
Wake the fuck up.

1095
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,347
You're in the middle
of a hostile takeover.

1096
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:30,801
- What?
<i>- Somebody's trying to buy this company.</i>

1097
00:49:30,852 --> 00:49:33,553
They got him.
Jahar Tsarnaev is hiding in a boat

1098
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:35,389
on a trailer in the backyard
of a house in Watertown.

1099
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,025
SWAT teams are there along with
surprisingly heavy artillery

1100
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:39,810
<i>for a metropolitan police department.
He is surrounded.</i>

1101
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:41,445
Okay, I'm going out there.

1102
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,530
But, Mac, you should know that
a few minutes ago, I quit.

1103
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:46,450
I'm gonna do sports
or perhaps nothing,

1104
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,151
because somehow in
regaining our credibility,

1105
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:50,370
we went from second
to fourth place.

1106
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:53,156
By the way,
Euripides can suck it.

1107
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:55,409
Chase the heroes up a tree,
throw rocks at them,

1108
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,077
and then get them down?
When does that happen?

1109
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:58,412
That was supposed
to be this week.

1110
00:49:58,463 --> 00:50:01,715
We were supposed to get down
from the tree this week.

1111
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:06,253
He's hiding in a boat
in someone's backyard?

1112
00:50:06,304 --> 00:50:10,807
I'd like confirmation on that
before I say it on TV!

1113
00:50:31,864 --> 00:50:34,414
I'm not spending the rest
of my career in a tree.

1114
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,700
I have to be somebody's husband...
Hers.

1115
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:44,424
You know who did
great this week?

1116
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,042
The police.

1117
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:48,678
The FBI. The DOJ.
Homeland Security.

1118
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,964
In less than 100 hours,
they found two needles

1119
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:52,632
in a haystack
the size of the world.

1120
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:55,802
You know who sucked?
Everybody else.

1121
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:58,805
Two times in 24 hours,
law enforcement officials

1122
00:50:58,856 --> 00:51:02,058
had to publically disclose
information before they wanted to

1123
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:06,530
because either a paper or website
put someone's life in danger.

1124
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,815
So I'm not so easily
surrendering

1125
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:12,819
to citizen journalists
or citizen detectives.

1126
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,122
Neal needs a lawyer.

1127
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:17,023
Get Rebecca Halliday
on the phone

1128
00:51:17,058 --> 00:51:19,543
'cause he's in
very serious trouble.

1129
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,578
We're gonna do a good show
people watch, Reese.

1130
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:24,331
If you have our back,
then we're not gonna let you get shot in yours.

1131
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:27,050
And apparently,
we're all up for sale.

1132
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:30,554
You were wrong.

1133
00:51:31,118 --> 00:51:33,473
We're not in the middle
of the third act.

1134
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:36,126
We just got to the end
of the first.

1135
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,262
