_

3
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:30,818
I'll tell you a secret.
We could be more profitable.

4
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:32,737
Small places here and there,
we could make more money.

5
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,239
You know why we don't?
We choose not to.

6
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,907
It's a hell of a business plan,
Reese.

7
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:38,409
Have a seat if you want.

8
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:40,711
There's coffee
and juice over there.

9
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:43,748
- How did you find out?
- We didn't find out. We figured it out.

10
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,999
That's an important
distinction.

11
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,218
We could have found out
by you telling us.

12
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:48,836
But Sloan Sabbith
figured it out

13
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,838
when instead of going down
off a weak earnings report,

14
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:55,593
our stock traded up because someone
was buying 5% of our shares.

15
00:01:55,595 --> 00:01:57,395
- 6%.
- 6%.

16
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:01,349
Which, when added to the 45%
that vests when you turn 25,

17
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,234
comes out to a total of what,
Randy?

18
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:05,169
King Arthur's knights could
have jousted on this table.

19
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:08,823
- 51%, that's right.
- Please don't give my brother a math quiz.

20
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:10,207
I wasn't testing his math.

21
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:12,276
I was testing
his attention span.

22
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:14,195
- Reese. You're a douche.
- Yeah? Yes, I am.

23
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:16,280
But I'm a douche on
the side of the angels.

24
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:19,000
And the reason there are areas,
small places here and there

25
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:20,868
where we choose not
to be more profitable,

26
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,754
is because we define success a
little different than you do.

27
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:27,425
For instance,
we have a news division.

28
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:33,714
- Are you nervous?
- No.

29
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:35,132
Really?

30
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:37,184
I'm okay.

31
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:39,053
- I'd be nervous.
- I'm fine.

32
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:40,521
- Here she comes.
- Yeah.

33
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:41,806
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not.

34
00:02:41,808 --> 00:02:44,058
I would love it if you guys

35
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:46,277
would stop committing
federal crimes.

36
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,029
Listen, we're a team here.
We're a family.

37
00:02:48,063 --> 00:02:49,647
But just to be clear,
he's the one who did it.

38
00:02:49,698 --> 00:02:51,816
Before we start, Neal,

39
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:54,902
it's very important that you
don't reveal your source to me.

40
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:57,705
- Yeah, no, I won't.
- If you were to reveal your source,

41
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,623
and then even in the course
of an informal conversation

42
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:02,626
told me you were planning on continuing
to commit this very serious felony,

43
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:05,629
attorney-client privilege
wouldn't protect either one of us.

44
00:03:05,664 --> 00:03:06,764
He's been prepped.

45
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:08,049
By whom?

46
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,668
By a member of the New York
bar who graduated seventh

47
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,337
<i>in his class from the fourth
best law school in America.</i>

48
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:15,089
Okay.

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,642
Well, as a member of the New York,
California, Illinois, and Florida bars

50
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:21,462
who graduated second in her class from
the third best law school in the world,

51
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:24,231
<i>you won't mind if I sweep up
after you a little?</i>

52
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:28,986
Because this is different than prosecuting
an escort service in Greenpoint.

53
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,688
I put away bad guys, Halliday.

54
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,189
I locked up Mafia dons.

55
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,443
And now when you go to work,
you put on makeup just like me.

56
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:37,194
Say you want another lawyer.

57
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:39,997
If it's gonna be like this,
I'd honestly prefer to go to jail.

58
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,666
When they were just your age,
my mother's parents

59
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:46,287
saw a production of
<i>You Can't Take It With You</i> on Broadway.

60
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:49,256
They thought it was a shame that
you had to live near New York

61
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,877
<i>or be able to afford to come here on
vacation to see a production that good.</i>

62
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:55,045
So they went to investors

63
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:59,049
and they put together $42,350

64
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:01,552
and mounted a touring company.

65
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:04,889
National Theatricals
became very successful.

66
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,526
And my mother worked in the office
while she was going to City College.

67
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,395
She discovered a small
string of radio stations

68
00:04:11,446 --> 00:04:13,030
that were going
out of business,

69
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:16,033
and using National
as collateral,

70
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:18,319
she got a loan and bought
the company that owned them,

71
00:04:18,353 --> 00:04:20,871
which was named after
a mythical city,

72
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:23,908
Atlantis Media.

73
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,827
She was 22 years old
at the time.

74
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:29,213
She met our father

75
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:31,332
and they got married.

76
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:35,136
And then she had a son who bore a striking
resemblance to the father's brother.

77
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,505
If we're gonna start
at 212 degrees,

78
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:39,340
we've got no place to go.

79
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,309
In the divorce, she gave him half the
controlling shares of the company,

80
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:44,228
or 45%.

81
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:45,763
With another 45% going to you.

82
00:04:45,814 --> 00:04:48,182
- I own no stock in AWM.
- In your mother's will.

83
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:50,434
I don't know what's in my mother's will.
I don't like to think about it.

84
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:52,153
You know exactly what's
in your mother's will.

85
00:04:52,187 --> 00:04:55,022
Is this what this is?
Is this a family feud?

86
00:04:55,073 --> 00:04:57,158
'Cause we're not talking
about Elton John's

87
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:59,443
birthday party now.
Lives are on the line.

88
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:02,413
Do me a favor and talk to me
with a little more condescension.

89
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:04,331
Great day in the morning.

90
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:07,785
- Randy and Blair are in the house.
<i>- Morning.</i>

91
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:11,205
Did you know I've known these two
since the minute they were born?

92
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:14,508
Your father's plane
was grounded in the snow

93
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:17,094
and he called me
from a pay phone and said,

94
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,797
"Charlie,
get yourself to Columbia Presbyterian.

95
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:23,601
Monica's in labor and I want to
make sure nobody steals my kids."

96
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:26,770
I wasn't in the delivery room,
'cause, you know, boundaries.

97
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:30,808
But we're all family
here is my point.

98
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:32,893
Randy,
you're an absolute knockout.

99
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:35,980
And, Blair,
you've grown into a fine young man.

100
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:37,982
I'm Blair.
He's Randy.

101
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:40,985
All right, well,
that was bound to happen.

102
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:43,487
Look,
I don't get involved at the corporate level.

103
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:47,291
I just came in to say hello.
I'm not even sitting down.

104
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,159
But out of curiosity,

105
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:51,161
if you were to sell
the company,

106
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:55,382
what would the new owners'
plans be for ACN?

107
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:57,134
I really don't know, Charlie.

108
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:59,420
But from what I understand,
you can make more money

109
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:02,473
selling the cameras than
transmitting images from them.

110
00:06:02,507 --> 00:06:04,975
So,
I imagine that's what they'll do.

111
00:06:05,844 --> 00:06:08,312
Yeah, I'm gonna sit down.

112
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,814
Let's start at the beginning.
Monday night.

113
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,517
- Go ahead.
- You don't have to tell him to go ahead. I just did.

114
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:16,020
And I was telling him it was
okay to follow your instruction.

115
00:06:16,022 --> 00:06:18,188
Go ahead.

116
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,940
It was the first night
of the Boston story

117
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:22,359
and I got a message on the site
asking for my encryption key.

118
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,996
I gave it. Then I was asked for a higher
level of encryption and I gave that.

119
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,832
The source instructed me to
buy an air-gapped computer,

120
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,868
a computer that's never been
hooked up to the Internet.

121
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,703
And he told me where he
had hidden the flash drive.

122
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:35,155
It was hidden <i>Godfather</i>
style in a restaurant bathroom.

123
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,259
- <i>Godfather</i> style?
- The scene where Michael shoots Barzini and the cop.

124
00:06:38,293 --> 00:06:39,426
- McCluskey.
- Right.

125
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:41,595
- <i>And it was Sollozzo.</i>
- The cop?

126
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,598
The cop was McCluskey.
It was McCluskey and Sollozzo, not Barzini.

127
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:46,216
- Maybe we can move past this.
- You got the flash drive...

128
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:47,851
And loaded it onto
the air-gapped computer.

129
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:49,403
<i>And what was on the drive?</i>

130
00:06:49,437 --> 00:06:52,890
A little more than 27,000
documents belonging to the DOD.

131
00:06:52,892 --> 00:06:55,559
- About half of them classified.
- Tell her about Kundu.

132
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:58,729
There's a small African country called
the Republic of Equatorial Kundu.

133
00:06:58,731 --> 00:07:01,732
It's a failed state.
The week before last, there were violent riots

134
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:05,235
that killed 38 people
including three Americans.

135
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:07,371
We're the ones
who started the riots.

136
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:08,739
How?

137
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:10,991
The Pentagon employs a PR firm
in Virginia called BCD.

138
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:14,211
They do propaganda work
planting positive stories

139
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:15,713
about the US in local papers.

140
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:18,215
But this time,
they planted a story in Kundu

141
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:21,218
about a rebel leader who was about
to attack another rebel group.

142
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:23,587
The story was false
and now 38 people are dead.

143
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:26,557
<i>In order to be able to better
convince Charlie to spend the money</i>

144
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:29,343
on investigators to go
through the 27,000 documents,

145
00:07:29,394 --> 00:07:32,730
I asked the source to get me a couple
of pieces of persuasive evidence.

146
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:34,932
- And I taught him how to use the NIPRNet...
- Yeah.

147
00:07:34,983 --> 00:07:36,850
...to move it from
the DOD's computer to mine.

148
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:39,103
- You were aware these were stolen documents?
<i>- Yes.</i>

149
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,322
- <i>And you asked your source to steal some more?</i>
- Yes.

150
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:44,441
- You even taught him how to do it?
- Yeah.

151
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:47,494
Well, here's what you've done.

152
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:50,280
You've committed espionage.

153
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:53,951
<i>You violated Title 18,
Section 793.</i>

154
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:56,537
Aside from the Espionage Act,
you can and will be charged

155
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:58,956
with violating the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act

156
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:00,841
<i>as well as federal statutes</i>

157
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:04,294
that punish the theft
or retention of stolen...

158
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:06,213
I mean,
I know these guys get legal training.

159
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:07,631
<i>How does this happen?</i>

160
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:09,633
Isn't this the very first thing
they're taught not to do?

161
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:11,635
- Once a year.
- Like, is there a sign hanging somewhere...

162
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,971
- It's not like they take a semester of criminal law.
- ...like a choking hazard sign?

163
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:17,057
"Don't ask sources
to steal things for you."

164
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:21,729
Title 18, 641,
Title 18, 793-E.

165
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,814
<i>18, 1030-A.</i>

166
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,983
And you violated
the USA Patriot Act.

167
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:28,202
Seems like the US government
has an awful lot of laws

168
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:29,953
protecting itself
from its citizens.

169
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:32,206
That's one way of looking at it.
It's a stupid way.

170
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,074
Is the DOD aware of this yet?

171
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,628
No, but if we were to run the story,
which we obviously won't,

172
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:40,831
we'd pick up the phone and find someone
at BCD to talk to on a Saturday.

173
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:43,417
- <i>Once we did that...</i>
- It would take about 10 seconds for BCD

174
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:46,837
to alert the Defense Department and the
FBI would show up here in an hour.

175
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,340
And they would take you in for questioning and
not let you go until you revealed your source.

176
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:53,343
- That's not gonna happen.
- Not gonna happen 'cause we're not gonna run the story.

177
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:55,512
We are gonna run the story
and I will avail myself

178
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:58,148
of the protection the First Amendment gives
me when it comes to revealing a source.

179
00:08:58,183 --> 00:09:00,684
Neither the First nor any
other amendment protects you

180
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,770
when you conspire
to commit treason.

181
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,189
Don't run the story and you
don't have to call BCD.

182
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,357
Don't call BCD and nobody
knows you have the documents.

183
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,610
Don't ever make contact
with your source again.

184
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,445
A truth that matters
can't stay hidden

185
00:09:11,496 --> 00:09:13,030
and it's no more
complicated than that.

186
00:09:13,032 --> 00:09:14,915
It's a lot more
complicated than that

187
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:16,700
and I decide
what goes on the air.

188
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:20,037
<i>So, in point of fact,
we'll be doing exactly what Rebecca just said,</i>

189
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,840
which is to say nothing.

190
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:42,559
Look at that.

191
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,862
Is that a good enough score
to get me in the FBI?

192
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,947
It's not a good enough
score to get you in the PTA.

193
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:49,867
I put two shots
right in the torso.

194
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:53,987
Unfortunately, the other four hit
anyone standing next to the torso.

195
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,873
Hey.
Thanks.

196
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:57,574
Thank you.

197
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:03,881
That one's yours?

198
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:05,916
It belongs to the Bureau,
but, yeah.

199
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:09,336
Tell me something.
Why don't they allow people to go in there alone?

200
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:11,672
They don't want to make it
easier to commit suicide.

201
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:14,725
So these are the good
people with the guns

202
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:16,810
who are going to stop the
bad people with the guns?

203
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:19,062
We're the good people with the guns.

204
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:21,181
How's the wedding coming along?

205
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:24,401
Be easier if people stopped
detonating bombs in Boston

206
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:27,855
and factories stopped
blowing up in Texas.

207
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:29,990
I missed a fitting last week.

208
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:31,608
Casualty count keeps rising.

209
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,911
I need to ask you about something.

210
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:36,864
- I figured.
- It'll be hypothetical.

211
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:39,867
It needs to be.
They give us a polygraph test every five years

212
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:41,618
and mine's coming up.

213
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,338
In today's climate,
what happens to a reporter

214
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:46,924
who's made contact with a
government whistle-blower?

215
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,593
- A leaker.
- A whistle-blower.

216
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:52,546
A leaker of secrets
who has taken it upon himself

217
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:54,631
to decide what laws to obey.

218
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,467
A reporter might gain
the favor of the government

219
00:10:57,469 --> 00:11:00,971
by reporting such a leak to us
instead of the general public.

220
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:03,690
That reporter's organization would
never have another source again.

221
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,309
And one might say
they'd abdicated

222
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,144
their responsibility
to a democracy.

223
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:08,946
Yeah, well,
might be full of shit, too.

224
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:13,233
- Look, I...
- Nothing.

225
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:14,952
The answer is nothing happens.

226
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:18,121
No reporter's ever been prosecuted
under the Espionage Act.

227
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:21,325
If they don't reveal their source,
they may be charged with contempt.

228
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,660
And if they go to jail,
it's for an average of 10 days.

229
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:25,913
At the most,
it's been six months.

230
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:28,131
You sound disappointed, Molly.

231
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,751
Sources come to us with things
they can't come to you with.

232
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:32,653
Yeah,
we have sources, too, Mac.

233
00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:34,888
We use them to stop violent
crimes before they happen.

234
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:38,058
You want to protect your sources,
so do we.

235
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:39,893
'Cause when there's a leak,
our sources get executed.

236
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,648
<i>Oh...</i>

237
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:46,850
<i>On most every occasion,
Obama refused to side</i>

238
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:49,186
<i>with the EPA's more
science-based positions.</i>

239
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:52,573
<i>I don't know, whether...
Whether it's cleaning up the air</i>

240
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:54,575
or forcing the national
resources industries

241
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:57,828
to abide by
existing regulations,

242
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:01,365
<i>ultimately the EPA
is only as good</i>

243
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,367
<i>as the White House
allows us to be.</i>

244
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:07,671
<i>Okay,
take the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.</i>

245
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:10,924
That was the largest oil spill
the US has experienced...

246
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,343
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

247
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:14,628
No.

248
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:18,181
- Shh. Don't be alarmed, okay?
- Okay.

249
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:21,134
I need a favor and I'll be able to
explain why in just a few minutes,

250
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:23,270
but for now you have
to trust a stranger.

251
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:24,554
What's the favor?

252
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:26,723
Hold my iPod
and put in the earbuds.

253
00:12:26,774 --> 00:12:27,941
In your ears?

254
00:12:27,976 --> 00:12:30,727
In your ears like
you're listening to it.

255
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,063
- You still have an iPod?
- I like the way the wheel clicks.

256
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:34,765
But that's not
important right now.

257
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,700
- Will you do it?
- Yeah, sure.

258
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:38,235
<i>Well,
I can give it to you on the record...</i>

259
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:41,071
- Shh.
<i>- ...or I can give it to you off the record.</i>

260
00:12:41,122 --> 00:12:43,323
<i>On the record
is gonna make you laugh.</i>

261
00:12:43,374 --> 00:12:44,708
<i>On the record?</i>

262
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:49,413
<i>The president continues
to believe in a strong EPA</i>

263
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:52,749
<i>led by an advocate
for smart pro-growth</i>

264
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,918
<i>environmental policies
that will protect...</i>

265
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,255
Okay, now you're laughing
just as I said you would be.

266
00:12:58,306 --> 00:13:00,424
Off the record...

267
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,392
Hey, hang on.

268
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,601
Off the record, even he'd admit

269
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:14,287
<i>he couldn't get a law
through this Congress</i>

270
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:16,857
reaffirming the US
as the name of the country.

271
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:20,277
So why bother wasting
what little capital he has

272
00:13:20,328 --> 00:13:22,329
<i>with the Republicans on the Hill
trying to get an up or down vote</i>

273
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:26,033
on his pick to run
a toothless agency?

274
00:13:28,586 --> 00:13:30,287
I was gonna get the buffet.

275
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:33,123
I don't know why, if given a choice,
anyone wouldn't get the buffet.

276
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:35,258
Under what circumstance
would you order off the menu?

277
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,744
If the menu had a five-pound lobster
and the buffet was soy-themed.

278
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,130
- All-you-can-eat assorted soy.
- Here's what I need you to do.

279
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:41,348
Why does there need
to be an assignment?

280
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:43,133
Hey,
are we in this buffet thing together?

281
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:45,552
Yeah,
we tell the waiter we're getting the buffet.

282
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:47,688
I did a Q and A in <i>Shape</i>
about my healthy diet.

283
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:49,973
- You lied.
- In a big way and I'm really hungry.

284
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:51,808
So I need you to get food for
me and I'll get food for you.

285
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,078
- Got it.
- Crab claws as far as the eye can see.

286
00:13:55,113 --> 00:13:56,813
Mushroom
and Swiss cheese omelet.

287
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:59,866
And I can't emphasize this enough...
Waffles.

288
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:02,652
- And what am I getting?
- Fruit salad.

289
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:05,038
- Have you decided yet?
- We're gonna have the buffet.

290
00:14:05,073 --> 00:14:07,741
I'm only having something light,
but I'm gonna keep him company at the buffet.

291
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,243
I know it seems like a waste paying
for the buffet and not eating it,

292
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:12,462
- but that's what I'm gonna do.
- Okay.

293
00:14:12,497 --> 00:14:13,747
Help yourselves.

294
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:16,166
I don't think he bought it.

295
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:19,386
I think it was a more detailed
explanation than he's used to getting.

296
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,508
Hey, I didn't tell you.
You made me $125 yesterday.

297
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,677
- How'd I do that?
- I bought $2,500 of Chipotle.

298
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,846
Please tell me you're talking
about the hot sauce.

299
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,849
- The stock, the company.
- You bought CMG?

300
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,484
- You told me to.
- No, I didn't.

301
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,737
You said Chipotle's
gonna have a good day.

302
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:39,740
Because I got an advance copy of the
earnings report and anticipated an uptick.

303
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:42,075
- Well, you were right.
- I know I was right.

304
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,494
Wait, you went on TV and told
people to buy the stock.

305
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:46,279
How was I at a greater
advantage than your viewers?

306
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,199
When did you buy?
Before or after we went on the air?

307
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:51,618
- Before.
- Before.

308
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:54,538
- Did you buy at 352.88?
- I bought at 344.91.

309
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,039
You bought it
at its opening price,

310
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,042
which is almost $8 a share lower
than it was when I went on the air.

311
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,961
Congratulations,
we're white-collar criminals.

312
00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:02,929
Okay, first let me say
if you're gonna be a criminal,

313
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:05,048
- that's probably the best kind to be.
- I don't want to be any kind.

314
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:07,551
We have to go to the office after this for Neal.
Should we talk to Rebecca?

315
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:10,303
I think we should.

316
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:14,191
No.
We're still gonna eat first.

317
00:15:14,225 --> 00:15:15,692
Crab claws, right there.

318
00:15:15,726 --> 00:15:16,977
- And, Don.
- Yeah?

319
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:18,562
You walked right past
the waffles.

320
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,280
I'm sorry.

321
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:24,731
_

322
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,968
_

323
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:43,670
No way in the wide fucking
world we're doing this story.

324
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:48,892
Hey.
What are you doing here?

325
00:15:48,926 --> 00:15:51,061
What are you doing here?

326
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:54,564
Came in to catch up on the week's worth
of news that happened during Boston.

327
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,766
Jenna Bush had a baby.

328
00:15:56,768 --> 00:16:00,070
I wonder how many great-grandfather
presidents we've had.

329
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:04,024
I fucked up so bad and it's all
gonna come down in the next hour.

330
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:06,109
What are you talking about?

331
00:16:06,994 --> 00:16:09,196
Hallie, what are...

332
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:20,457
Last night...
This morning around 2:00 AM,

333
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,958
we were wrapping up
the Boston coverage

334
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:23,793
and I was heading home
and I saw that ACN

335
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:26,296
hadn't posted a tweet
in six and a half hours.

336
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,798
Neal usually does that and he
likes to post every 30 minutes,

337
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,352
but I knew where his head was,
so I posted for him when I got home.

338
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:35,105
That was 2:37 this morning.

339
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:37,057
I went to sleep
and then woke up

340
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,192
and deleted it
a half hour later.

341
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:40,644
- 3:04.
- What was the tweet?

342
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:42,112
- Nobody's picked it up yet.
- What was it?

343
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:44,397
- I knew it was wrong the second I...
- Hal.

344
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,869
I hit send and thought,
"Well, that's done" and turned the lights off.

345
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:51,738
Republicans rejoice"...

346
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:59,212
"Republicans rejoice that there's
finally a national tragedy

347
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:01,665
that doesn't involve guns."

348
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,393
- <i>It was up for how long?</i>
- 27 minutes.

349
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:15,512
In the middle of the night
on a night when everyone

350
00:17:15,563 --> 00:17:17,397
was paying attention
to something else.

351
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:18,982
Is there any chance
it won't be found?

352
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,484
No.

353
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,520
I came in to get fired.

354
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:26,356
Reese,
where did our stock close yesterday?

355
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:27,991
<i>66.</i>

356
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:30,994
And what's Savannah Capital
offering you per share?

357
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:32,195
81.

358
00:17:32,246 --> 00:17:36,416
45% of the controlling shares

359
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,536
times 66 equals...

360
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:40,670
Carry the three.

361
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,506
<i>Times 81.</i>

362
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,059
All right.
Right now your stock

363
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:49,879
is worth $2.3 billion.

364
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:51,881
Savannah Capital says
it should be worth

365
00:17:51,933 --> 00:17:55,018
$3.1 billion.

366
00:17:55,052 --> 00:17:56,853
Aren't $2.3 billion

367
00:17:56,887 --> 00:18:00,140
and $3.1 billion
the exact same thing?

368
00:18:00,191 --> 00:18:02,943
- What's the difference?
- 800 million.

369
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:05,729
Yes, good, Randy.
But I think what Charlie is saying is

370
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:09,983
what can you buy with 3.1 billion
that you can't buy with 2.3 billion?

371
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:12,953
You seem to think our plan is
to hit the ATM and go shopping.

372
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:14,904
- What is your plan?
- My immediate plan

373
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:17,741
is to ask you why the fuck you
think we need to tell you our plan.

374
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:20,410
<i>We're not seeking
permission for something.</i>

375
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,128
In 10 days, we turn 25,

376
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:25,298
inherit 45% of the
controlling shares of AWM,

377
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,083
<i>and sell them
to Savannah Capital,</i>

378
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:29,669
who was able to buy 6%
of the controlling shares

379
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,973
without any of the geniuses
at this company noticing.

380
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:35,976
And do you know what I find
so perfectly poetic, Reese?

381
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,144
<i>Is that you would have
been looking out for it</i>

382
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,597
if you remembered
when our birthday was.

383
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,182
Or that we were born.

384
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,901
People like you are the reason
people hate people like me.

385
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:46,987
Guess that's why you didn't
sit with us at the funeral.

386
00:18:47,021 --> 00:18:49,105
Jesus Christ,
my father had just died.

387
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:51,825
I wasn't paying a lot of attention
to where my fucking seats were.

388
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:53,109
- Reese.
- Can we not?

389
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,411
I got to tell you something.

390
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:56,997
'Cause we're talking
about 141,000 people.

391
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:58,531
Dad thought you
were an asshole.

392
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:01,918
All right. All right.

393
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,286
<i>All right.</i>

394
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:06,289
I want you to sit out a couple of rounds,
all right?

395
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,759
- All right?
- Yeah.

396
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:23,640
It's me now.

397
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:26,276
As I understand it,
the criteria for running a story

398
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,061
is one,
are we confident it's accurate,

399
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,729
and two,
is it in the public interest.

400
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,281
And this passes those tests.

401
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:32,816
You were confident
Genoa was accurate.

402
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,884
I have my own personal
third criteria,

403
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,820
which is will it land
any of my guys in jail?

404
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,655
- That's not...
- This passes that test, too.

405
00:19:38,706 --> 00:19:41,541
By the way,
in order to ascertain its accuracy,

406
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:43,493
we'd have to pick up
the phone and call BCD,

407
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:45,912
<i>which is the trip wire
that sends in the FBI.</i>

408
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:49,582
Now hand over the flash drive so I
can crush it with a meat tenderizer.

409
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,551
What's he crushing
with a meat tenderizer?

410
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:53,336
Truth. Hope.
Journalistic integrity.

411
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:56,172
Hey, I've got more journalistic
integrity in my whole body

412
00:19:56,223 --> 00:19:58,224
- than you've got in your...
- You've got that turned around.

413
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:00,810
You've got more journalistic
integrity in your whole body...

414
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,679
- That's still wrong.
- What the fuck am I trying to say?

415
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,814
- That you're a pussy.
- Watch your mouth, Mandela.

416
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:06,933
I'd be a pussy if I was
afraid of going to jail.

417
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:08,685
In fact,
that wouldn't even make me a pussy.

418
00:20:08,687 --> 00:20:10,520
Other people have gone to jail
for refusing to give up a source.

419
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:12,021
I'd consider it
a badge of honor.

420
00:20:12,073 --> 00:20:14,407
Be sure to show your badge to
your roommates when you get there.

421
00:20:14,442 --> 00:20:17,410
Neal, it is not refusing to give up
a source that we're talking about.

422
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,996
That's a contempt charge.
It is espionage.

423
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,749
- No, it's not.
- Along with a Christmas list of other felonies...

424
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:25,418
- Why?
- I've just come from talking to a friend.

425
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:28,221
- She's been with the FBI 15 years.
- Unimpeachable source.

426
00:20:28,255 --> 00:20:30,957
This is her area and she says they'd
never charge him with espionage.

427
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:33,343
This woman does not know
what she's talking about.

428
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:35,545
Yeah, she does.
No journalist has ever

429
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,714
been charged with espionage.
She says it'll be contempt.

430
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:40,133
They would charge him with
kidnapping the Lindbergh baby

431
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:41,768
if they think
it'll get them to the leak.

432
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:43,720
- 30 days.
- She says more like 10.

433
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:46,856
10 days. That's one day for
every three and a half people

434
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:49,859
we killed by knowingly planting a
false story in a foreign newspaper.

435
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:50,944
You did the division that fast?

436
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:52,779
Yeah, cliche buster.
I'm good at math.

437
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:55,031
Please tell me you're not
softening your position on this.

438
00:20:55,065 --> 00:20:57,567
- My position hasn't softened at all.
- Smartest person in the room.

439
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:00,737
- There's no question we have to do the story.
- She is an idiot savant.

440
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:02,822
- When did you change your mind?
- I didn't change my mind.

441
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:05,241
I've known we had to do the story
the second he showed it to us.

442
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:07,293
Do you remember last night?
It was last night.

443
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:09,212
- I do remember last night.
- You went on and on

444
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:12,248
- about how we have to protect Neal because we're family.
- That was you.

445
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,251
You didn't push back.
I interpreted that as agreeing with me.

446
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:18,638
You should have interpreted that as we just
finished five days of covering Boston,

447
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:21,891
it was late, I was tired,
and I was sleeping.

448
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:24,394
How often are you sleeping when
I'm talking to you at night?

449
00:21:24,428 --> 00:21:26,012
I'd really have no way
of knowing that.

450
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:27,597
The two lawyers
in the room say no.

451
00:21:27,648 --> 00:21:29,265
The two journalists
in the room say yes.

452
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:31,901
- There are three journalists.
- Did I count that wrong?

453
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:34,687
If you think being an ass is gonna
make me less inclined to protect you,

454
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:38,024
think again, mofo.
I can out-ass anyone in the Tri-State Area.

455
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:39,442
He's telling the truth, Neal.

456
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:41,611
It feels like you're on my side,
but just barely.

457
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:44,080
- Jenna!
- You make that poor girl work on a Saturday?

458
00:21:44,114 --> 00:21:45,949
She's a recent journalism
school graduate.

459
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,584
I'm just completing
her education.

460
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:49,335
What she's learning from me
can't be found in books.

461
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,954
- Yes?
- I'd like a Dr Pepper, please.

462
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:52,172
- Sure.
<i>- Billy.</i>

463
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:53,590
- What?
- Listen to me.

464
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:54,958
- I am.
- We're doing this because we have to.

465
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:57,093
All right, me and you.
You want to go?

466
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,829
- You already know you're gonna lose.
- Take the first swing.

467
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:02,799
The possibility that reporters are
gonna make bad behavior public

468
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,435
is what stops people
from behaving badly.

469
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:08,855
The possibility of jail is supposed to
be what makes people stop behaving badly.

470
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:11,975
Well, it hasn't 'cause they're still doing
it and they're gonna keep doing it.

471
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:14,644
A PR company killed 38 people.

472
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:18,815
We do nothing,
and the 39th is on us.

473
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:20,567
Game over.
Let's make the phone call.

474
00:22:20,618 --> 00:22:22,735
Not so fast.

475
00:22:24,154 --> 00:22:26,956
And it'll just mean everybody
gets what they want,

476
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:28,875
which is a rudderless EPA.

477
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:32,328
I can't do what Congress
will never do,

478
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,497
<i>which is regulate
climate pollution.</i>

479
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:38,501
It's why so many Democrats
think he's jaw-droppingly weak.

480
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:41,888
<i>Yeah. All right.
Yeah.</i>

481
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:54,017
- Excuse me, Mr. Westbrook?
- Yeah?

482
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:55,952
Do we know each other?

483
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:57,237
You're Richard Westbrook,

484
00:22:57,271 --> 00:22:59,939
Deputy Assistant
Administrator of the EPA?

485
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,442
- I am.
- I heard your end of the call.

486
00:23:02,493 --> 00:23:04,193
- <i>You did?</i>
- Yes.

487
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:07,864
I have more bad news.
I'm a producer with ACN. Maggie Jordan.

488
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:10,366
How much of the call
did you hear?

489
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:13,202
I heard you say that
the president's pick

490
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:15,004
to run the EPA
will never get a vote,

491
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,923
that the EPA
is a toothless agency...

492
00:23:16,957 --> 00:23:19,375
- Jesus.
- ...and that the president's jaw-droppingly weak.

493
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:22,378
No, I said Democrats

494
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,881
think the president's
jaw-droppingly weak.

495
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:28,184
Wait.
That's not better.

496
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:29,719
I was wondering if you'd
like to comment further.

497
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:32,689
This car is half empty.

498
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:34,357
I looked around.

499
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:37,727
I didn't see anyone near me except
that guy with the headphones.

500
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:40,446
- I was sitting right here.
- Why didn't I see you?

501
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:43,149
I may have slid down
in my seat.

502
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,286
- What did you say your name was?
- Maggie Jordan.

503
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,737
Well, that sucks,
Maggie Jordan.

504
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:49,072
You're on a train, Richard.

505
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:51,324
You don't have a reasonable
expectation of privacy.

506
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,626
What's more,
you were talking to another reporter.

507
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:56,245
I was talking to a reporter
I know and trust.

508
00:23:56,297 --> 00:23:59,549
- And I was off the record.
- You were off the record to him, not to me.

509
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,585
- You were hiding like...
- Why not make the call from between the cars?

510
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:05,254
- It's too loud!
- Why not wait till we get back to New York?

511
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:07,140
Because this guy's
on deadline now

512
00:24:07,174 --> 00:24:09,425
and I wanted to give him
background on a story

513
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:11,511
that will hopefully
put pressure on...

514
00:24:11,562 --> 00:24:15,148
Look, I work at the EPA, okay?

515
00:24:15,182 --> 00:24:17,767
We're staffed by seven people
and a high school intern.

516
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:20,186
We don't care
who's in the White House.

517
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:22,905
We are pro drinkable water
and breathable air.

518
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,907
We are anti the world
coming to an end.

519
00:24:24,942 --> 00:24:27,827
But you're also public officials
and what you have to say

520
00:24:27,861 --> 00:24:30,947
about how a president's overseeing
your agency is relevant.

521
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:33,783
- My job...
- Your job? Your job.

522
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:36,569
If I hear one more
gossip columnist

523
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:38,338
use democracy as a fig leaf,

524
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:41,207
I'm gonna eat an IBM Selectric.

525
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:45,762
- It's an old-fashioned...
- I know what an IBM Selectric is.

526
00:24:45,796 --> 00:24:48,131
And I should tell you you've been
on the record this whole time.

527
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:49,632
- How?
- You didn't say...

528
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:51,300
I didn't say I was
off the record.

529
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:54,220
I didn't call time-out.
I took my foot off the base.

530
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:57,106
Look, Richard,
there's news happening right in front of me.

531
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:58,941
- It's my job...
- Don't.

532
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:02,311
It's my responsibility,
okay, to report it.

533
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:06,482
Yeah, but you're not interested
in the news part of the news.

534
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:09,902
I'd be happy to give you an interview
about the news part of the news.

535
00:25:09,953 --> 00:25:12,388
You like the unguarded moments,

536
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:16,492
private behavior that can never
stand up to public scrutiny.

537
00:25:16,494 --> 00:25:18,828
But you didn't tell the truth
until you were off the record

538
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:20,713
with the guy on the
other end of the phone.

539
00:25:20,748 --> 00:25:23,299
The unguarded moments
are where the truth is.

540
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,752
I don't care.
I get to be guarded if I want.

541
00:25:25,803 --> 00:25:27,553
And you were slumped
down in a chair.

542
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:29,088
How honest was that?

543
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:36,596
Yeah.

544
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:38,765
You're right.

545
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:44,854
- What?
- You're right.

546
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:48,775
- What do you mean?
- That part was wrong.

547
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:50,443
Is this a trick?

548
00:25:50,494 --> 00:25:51,861
No.

549
00:25:51,912 --> 00:25:54,580
I'm deleting my notes.
I apologize, Richard.

550
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:57,200
And good luck.
Here's my card

551
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,285
if you ever want
to talk on the record,

552
00:25:59,336 --> 00:26:02,288
which I strongly
encourage you to do.

553
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:04,457
Enjoy the rest of your trip.

554
00:26:09,763 --> 00:26:12,548
I don't understand
what's happening now.

555
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,635
Crab claw.
Keep it low.

556
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:19,939
It says here in the ACN
employee's guide,

557
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:23,526
which has some interesting information
I definitely should have read

558
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,062
before drinking beer with Jim, Neal,
and some college kids in my office,

559
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:28,698
that we'd only be in trouble if I
was a producer of financial news.

560
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:31,484
I'm not. I produce the 10:00 hour,
which you occasionally host.

561
00:26:31,535 --> 00:26:34,737
- Keep reading.
- Employees are barred from, blah, blah, blah, blah.

562
00:26:34,788 --> 00:26:37,290
In accordance with the SEC,
blah, blah.

563
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:39,375
Married, engaged to be married,

564
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:41,744
cohabitating or in what
could reasonably be considered

565
00:26:41,746 --> 00:26:44,080
a relationship
where the two parties...

566
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:46,215
The SEC will notice
a pattern in your trading.

567
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,417
That you appear to be
front-running news for ACN.

568
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:49,969
And they will
connect you to me.

569
00:26:50,003 --> 00:26:52,672
- And even if they don't...
- We're a couple?

570
00:26:53,757 --> 00:26:55,091
Hmm?

571
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:56,476
You consider us a couple?

572
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,644
I don't understand
that question.

573
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,981
Yeah, you do, 'cause this is exactly
how I act in the same situation.

574
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:04,100
Suddenly I pretend I'm stupid
and hearing impaired.

575
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:06,519
- Do you consider us a couple?
- Do you consider us a couple?

576
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,522
- I do that, too, Socrates.
- We are...

577
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:11,491
- Yep.
- Okay, let me say...

578
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:13,326
- Go ahead.
- Here's what we are.

579
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,528
- Bring it.
- I love spending time with you.

580
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:17,163
- Oh! Oh, man.
- Wait.

581
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:18,831
I can't believe
I'm getting Don Keefer'd.

582
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:21,918
You're not.
I would never Don Keefer you.

583
00:27:21,952 --> 00:27:24,587
We're a couple. Totally.
Of course we're a couple.

584
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:27,206
Let me remind you, I was the one who had
a problem with you trading Chipotle.

585
00:27:27,257 --> 00:27:29,075
Why?
Because we're a couple.

586
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:31,460
You're the one buying up
Chipotle hither and yon as if,

587
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:34,297
"Duh, look,
I don't produce a financial show."

588
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:35,798
See what I mean?

589
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:37,600
Okay.

590
00:27:39,186 --> 00:27:41,220
Got to slide me a waffle, man.

591
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:47,643
I'll address that aggressive
behavior in just a moment.

592
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:49,195
<i>He looked up, you see?</i>

593
00:27:49,229 --> 00:27:51,597
He saw that the pitcher
wasn't covering first base,

594
00:27:51,632 --> 00:27:54,534
<i>which is what the pitcher is supposed
to do on a ground ball to first.</i>

595
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:56,068
<i>They've known that
since Little League.</i>

596
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,987
He looked up,
and you can see it on the replay.

597
00:27:57,989 --> 00:28:00,289
He looks up because he knew the
pitcher wasn't covering the bag

598
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,875
<i>and he needed to gauge his
position relative to the base.</i>

599
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,078
What happens when you take
your eye off the ball?

600
00:28:06,129 --> 00:28:09,582
God, Jim, what in the name of
sweet Christ are you talking about?

601
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:11,884
- Bill Buckner.
- Is this the best time, babe?

602
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,921
- I thought it might be a welcome distraction.
- It's an unwelcome annoyance.

603
00:28:14,972 --> 00:28:16,923
I knew going in
that was a possibility.

604
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:19,308
Buckner needs to be exonerated.

605
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:22,595
You make one mistake and ev...

606
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:27,270
_

607
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:38,995
<i>CNN represents</i>

608
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:41,581
<i>a small fraction
of Time Warner's revenue.</i>

609
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:45,334
<i>NBC Nightly News</i>
a small fraction of Comcast.

610
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:48,337
And ACN an even smaller
fraction of Atlantis.

611
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:52,258
But they are the face and voice
of their parent corporations.

612
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:54,010
- So what?
- So what?

613
00:28:54,044 --> 00:28:55,795
Yes.

614
00:28:57,714 --> 00:28:59,048
That's a fair question.

615
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,549
I think you're making
good headway.

616
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:03,019
- As an experienced negotiator...
- Reese Lansing.

617
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:04,971
As the president
of a news network,

618
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:08,107
all I do every day
is fight with him.

619
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:10,810
All I do every day
is fight with Leona.

620
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:12,528
And the thing of it is this...

621
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:15,448
I win almost every one
of those battles.

622
00:29:15,482 --> 00:29:19,201
What network president can say
that about their corporate parent?

623
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:21,287
I win almost every one
of those battles

624
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:24,790
and the reason is most
of the time they let me.

625
00:29:24,825 --> 00:29:27,910
Your father absolutely did
not think you were an asshole.

626
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:31,297
They want ACN
to do the news well.

627
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:33,416
And we're not always
successful at it,

628
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,835
but that's what we try to do,
and they let me win

629
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:39,121
because they just want us to play our role.

630
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:40,840
As a public service.

631
00:29:40,891 --> 00:29:43,175
As a patriotic sacrifice.

632
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:44,760
As a moral imperative,

633
00:29:44,762 --> 00:29:47,596
they do not require
ACN to make money.

634
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,516
Why?
Because they can afford it.

635
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,435
- Charlie.
- Isn't that something you want to be a part of

636
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:54,487
and not something
you want to end?

637
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:57,239
Don't you want to be
handed the baton?

638
00:29:57,274 --> 00:30:00,359
We want to strike out
on our own.

639
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,913
Be entrepreneurs.
Maybe get into Bitcoin.

640
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:06,248
Shut the fuck up, Randy.

641
00:30:07,117 --> 00:30:09,585
Go deal with it.

642
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:12,421
This is so fucked up,
I don't even know where to begin.

643
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:14,206
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ!

644
00:30:14,257 --> 00:30:15,458
She understands it's fucked up.

645
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:17,626
The RNC wants a public apology

646
00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:20,296
or we can't book
Republicans on any show.

647
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,932
- An entire political party.
- They deserve a public apology.

648
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:26,218
It's almost six months to the day
since our last public apology.

649
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:28,070
There is no question
that your anger is founded.

650
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:29,805
I wasn't questioning it, Jim.

651
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:31,974
I'm not on the fence about
whether I should be angry.

652
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:34,143
I'd like to say the
following in Hallie's defense.

653
00:30:34,194 --> 00:30:36,278
Like everybody,
she was incredibly tired last night...

654
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:39,315
- That's just lame.
- This wasn't something she would normally do.

655
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:41,367
She deleted it.
She knew it was wrong.

656
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:43,652
Are you two together?

657
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:45,204
We met on the Romney campaign.

658
00:30:45,238 --> 00:30:46,655
But that is not
why she got the job.

659
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:48,491
She has done great work
for ACN Digital.

660
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:50,092
Read her last 10 columns,
look at her...

661
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:52,878
I don't care if she wrote the
collective works of Tolstoy.

662
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:55,164
She also wrote this.

663
00:30:58,135 --> 00:31:00,052
I'm not gonna make
you fire her.

664
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:01,504
- Thank you.
<i>- No, I'm sorry.</i>

665
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:03,923
I meant I'm going to do it.

666
00:31:06,009 --> 00:31:07,393
If your mind is made up...

667
00:31:07,427 --> 00:31:09,895
I don't get to make up
my own mind now.

668
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,847
The RNC is doing it for me.

669
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:14,567
If your mind is made up,
then it's my job to fire her.

670
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:16,102
What?

671
00:31:16,153 --> 00:31:18,521
Excuse me. Sorry.
I think this is about me.

672
00:31:18,523 --> 00:31:20,689
Come in.

673
00:31:20,691 --> 00:31:22,992
We haven't really met.
I'm Charlie Skinner.

674
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:25,945
- I know.
- Republicans are rejoicing?

675
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:29,415
You know 144 people got blown up,
right?

676
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:31,867
And that three
of those people are dead.

677
00:31:31,918 --> 00:31:34,120
And that one of them
is eight years fucking old.

678
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:35,337
Yes, sir.

679
00:31:35,372 --> 00:31:37,423
I'm so curious, I have to ask.

680
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:39,375
At the time when you typed it,

681
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:43,295
in that moment,
what were you thinking the value of it was?

682
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:45,381
Retweets.

683
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:51,854
I appreciate your honesty.

684
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:55,357
You should know Jim did
everything he could for you.

685
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,727
We'll say it was a low-level
staffer and they were fired,

686
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:00,780
but we won't reveal your name.

687
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:03,866
- Thank you.
- That's all.

688
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:13,876
- Can I...?
- Yeah.

689
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:25,888
You're a reporter?

690
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:27,756
I'm sorry?

691
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:29,475
<i>You're a reporter?</i>

692
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:31,677
A news producer.
ACN.

693
00:32:31,728 --> 00:32:34,180
You were in Boston
for the bombing?

694
00:32:34,231 --> 00:32:35,848
I was there for the race.

695
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:37,766
You're okay?

696
00:32:37,818 --> 00:32:40,019
I finished about a half hour
before the explosion.

697
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,604
Good thing you're fast.

698
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:45,107
Um, before,
with that guy from the EPA,

699
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:46,992
<i>you were on solid ground.</i>

700
00:32:47,027 --> 00:32:48,410
In Massachusetts it's illegal

701
00:32:48,445 --> 00:32:50,112
to record anybody
without two-party consent.

702
00:32:50,114 --> 00:32:53,199
But two things. One,
you are protected by the First Amendment.

703
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,168
And two,
you were in Connecticut at the time.

704
00:32:56,203 --> 00:32:57,786
Yeah.

705
00:32:57,838 --> 00:33:00,623
I think I was okay
journalistically,

706
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:03,125
and I'm pretty sure
I was okay legally.

707
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:06,328
I'm just not sure
I was airtight morally.

708
00:33:06,363 --> 00:33:07,847
How did you hear us?

709
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:09,598
I wasn't listening to music.

710
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:12,518
What do you do?

711
00:33:12,552 --> 00:33:14,803
I teach.
Fordham Law School.

712
00:33:14,855 --> 00:33:18,240
You're pretty young for a law professor.
What do you teach?

713
00:33:18,275 --> 00:33:20,309
- Ethics.
- Get out of town.

714
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,194
I'm trying.
I'm on an express train.

715
00:33:22,229 --> 00:33:24,647
Excuse me.

716
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:27,650
- Hi.
- Hi. Could I...

717
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,818
speak with you a second?

718
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,871
- Sure.
- Yeah.

719
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,328
I spoke to our counsel,

720
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:41,997
and she says there's nothing
stopping you from running the story.

721
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:44,166
I'm not doing anything
with the story.

722
00:33:44,168 --> 00:33:46,335
Our counsel says there's
nothing stopping you.

723
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:49,588
If you want to speak to me on the record,
I'm happy to listen,

724
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:52,391
but I'm not taking what I
overheard to my senior producer.

725
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:58,063
I am willing to trade
you another story

726
00:33:58,098 --> 00:34:02,768
for the promise that you won't use
my candid remarks about the president.

727
00:34:02,819 --> 00:34:06,238
I have no intention
of using your candid remarks

728
00:34:06,273 --> 00:34:08,107
or even your
on-the-record remarks

729
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:11,110
which were meant
for someone else.

730
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:14,079
I just don't understand.

731
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,084
I don't know how to make it
any clearer than that.

732
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,004
Good luck.

733
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,045
I think you're
freaking him out.

734
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:35,100
How's your boss gonna feel
about you passing on a story?

735
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:37,970
And then another story?

736
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:39,888
Whatever the second story is,

737
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,975
I'm not going to blackmail
him into giving it to me.

738
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:46,779
You can save your students
a lot of time.

739
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:48,981
On the first day of class,

740
00:34:49,032 --> 00:34:52,901
tell them they know the difference
between right and wrong.

741
00:34:52,903 --> 00:34:55,287
Do what's right.
They don't need a lawyer

742
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:56,789
to tell them
their moral absolutes.

743
00:34:56,823 --> 00:35:00,075
And whenever you hear
someone giving a monologue

744
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:01,577
defending the ethics
of their position,

745
00:35:01,628 --> 00:35:03,579
you can be pretty sure
they know they were wrong.

746
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:06,715
Can I point something out to you?
You're giving a monologue.

747
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,051
Everyone does where I work.

748
00:35:12,255 --> 00:35:14,206
You know what Vipassana is?

749
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,724
It's a small Italian motorbike.

750
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:18,177
- Not a Vespa. Vipassana.
- I know what Vipassana is.

751
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:20,846
It's a meditation retreat in India
where you don't talk for a week.

752
00:35:20,897 --> 00:35:22,398
But feel free
to tell me anyway.

753
00:35:22,432 --> 00:35:24,350
Maybe two weeks.
Think I'm gonna do it.

754
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:26,268
You should.

755
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,519
You seem tense.

756
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,605
Mm, you got that backwards,
money honey.

757
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:32,691
No, I'm only a little tense because of
what's happening at the office right now.

758
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:34,910
- Okay.
- All right.

759
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:37,162
Hey,
it's my parents' 40th anniversary

760
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:40,099
and the week after next there's a party.
Do you want to come?

761
00:35:41,418 --> 00:35:43,652
Absolutely, I do,
but here's the thing.

762
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:46,422
- You might be on Vipassana?
- Or maybe a Yamaha.

763
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:48,173
Big laugh from the crowd.

764
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:50,709
All right, let's just...
Now we're meeting parents?

765
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,177
And it all started
with a stock trade.

766
00:35:52,212 --> 00:35:54,279
You see how things spiral out of control?
They spiral.

767
00:35:54,314 --> 00:35:57,299
Just buy mutual funds.
There's nothing wrong with mutual funds.

768
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:59,551
I feel like I'm being
tested right now.

769
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,305
That's it? You're leaving?
Wait.

770
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:07,309
I'm hailing a cab.

771
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:10,479
All right.
Close one.

772
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,797
Yeah.

773
00:36:11,831 --> 00:36:14,149
Yours is an unusual
position for a reporter.

774
00:36:14,151 --> 00:36:17,486
Who decides what's private and
what's information people should know?

775
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:20,572
In the airspace right around me,
I do.

776
00:36:24,544 --> 00:36:27,496
- Hi.
- I'm not scamming you, Richard.

777
00:36:27,547 --> 00:36:29,748
I know.
Can I have a word?

778
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:31,550
- Sure.
- Yeah.

779
00:36:37,674 --> 00:36:40,142
This report won't be
released for a week.

780
00:36:40,176 --> 00:36:42,428
The White House got it today,
but they won't show it

781
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,563
to the president
until at least Monday.

782
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:48,684
It's yours,
along with an exclusive interview.

783
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:50,936
What's in it?

784
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:54,740
The level of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere

785
00:36:54,774 --> 00:36:57,359
has passed
a long-feared milestone.

786
00:36:57,361 --> 00:36:59,578
The amount of poison gas in
the air hasn't been this high

787
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:01,447
in three million years,
since before there were humans.

788
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:04,500
- We get the report?
<i>- You</i> get the report.

789
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:06,535
Embargoed until Monday.

790
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:08,537
And an exclusive interview.

791
00:37:08,588 --> 00:37:10,789
- With who?
- Me.

792
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,925
Any chance we can get
the administrator?

793
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:15,594
There hasn't been
an administrator

794
00:37:15,628 --> 00:37:17,846
of the Environmental
Protection Agency for a while

795
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:20,382
because Senate Republicans
won't confirm one

796
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:22,885
and the president doesn't want
to waste political capital.

797
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:27,106
Though I'm not sure
what he's saving it up for.

798
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,142
That statement
was on the record.

799
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:32,694
Nice meeting you.

800
00:37:32,729 --> 00:37:36,698
Richard, be careful when you're
talking out loud in public.

801
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:38,567
I was careful.

802
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:40,953
Okay, but you just told
a train car full of people

803
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:43,071
- that the apocalypse is nigh.
- Damn it.

804
00:37:43,123 --> 00:37:44,656
It's all right.
Nobody's listening.

805
00:37:44,707 --> 00:37:46,792
Tell me about it.

806
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:52,030
It was nice meeting you, Jack.
I've got to get my bag.

807
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:53,332
Isn't that your bag?

808
00:37:53,383 --> 00:37:55,551
This is a month's rent for me.

809
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:57,169
It's my executive producer's.

810
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,504
I don't know your name.

811
00:37:58,555 --> 00:38:00,022
Maggie Jordan.

812
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:01,890
I'd love to call you.

813
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:07,012
- Here's my card.
- Great.

814
00:38:10,483 --> 00:38:13,769
And, Jack,
I've got a report here from the EPA

815
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:15,687
that says you probably
shouldn't wait that long.

816
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:20,609
And the government's
complicity was covert,

817
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,445
robbing the citizens in a democracy
of the information they need

818
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:25,998
if they're going to have an intelligent
debate about foreign policy.

819
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:28,834
Covert ops are why you don't hear
much about the Mafia anymore.

820
00:38:28,868 --> 00:38:30,786
Covert ops are why
your parents are alive.

821
00:38:30,837 --> 00:38:34,006
They're why there are fewer
nuclear scientists alive in Iran.

822
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,958
Covert ops are what's
forcing al-Qaeda...

823
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,627
Covert ops were
behind Iran-Contra

824
00:38:38,678 --> 00:38:40,212
and it was the press
who exposed it.

825
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:42,848
Covert ops got money
and equipment and training

826
00:38:42,882 --> 00:38:45,467
to the mujahedeen after the
Soviets invaded Afghanistan.

827
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:48,520
The press not knowing about it
is how Communism fell in Europe.

828
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:50,606
- I can go all day long.
- God knows.

829
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,641
Excuse me.

830
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:54,226
- Where are you going?
- The men's room.

831
00:38:54,277 --> 00:38:57,446
Neal, leave behind the drive.

832
00:39:00,817 --> 00:39:01,984
Are you serious?

833
00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:04,953
Well,
you're hotheaded right now.

834
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:07,623
Leave the flash drive
on the table.

835
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:18,333
It's locked in a filing
cabinet under my desk.

836
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,337
Are you getting my point?

837
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:25,474
Yeah, you don't want Neal to go to
jail for 10 days and neither do I.

838
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:27,092
But these are the rules
of cribbage.

839
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:29,177
I could swallow this key,
you know.

840
00:39:29,229 --> 00:39:31,730
Yeah, 'cause what criminal
mastermind could open

841
00:39:31,764 --> 00:39:35,100
an Office Depot filing
cabinet without a key?

842
00:39:35,151 --> 00:39:39,655
You're thinking of different ways
to murder me right now.

843
00:39:46,363 --> 00:39:47,863
<i>New York Observer</i>.

844
00:39:47,914 --> 00:39:49,197
How did word get out this fast?

845
00:39:49,249 --> 00:39:51,033
Fast is the speed
at which word travels.

846
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,584
It's been blowing up
for an hour.

847
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,037
Yeah,
but I saw Charlie's statement and apology.

848
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,538
He kept his promise.
He didn't name anyone.

849
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,457
I did.
I outed myself on Twitter.

850
00:39:58,508 --> 00:40:00,375
My account, not the network.

851
00:40:00,377 --> 00:40:02,511
"Just left ACN
for the last time.

852
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:04,179
Great five weeks.
Honest people.

853
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:06,682
Sensational experience.
One regret.

854
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:10,052
I tweeted a terrible joke on the network's account.
No one else involved."

855
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:13,221
Least I could do was make sure no
one thought it was someone else.

856
00:40:13,223 --> 00:40:14,890
You're gonna get
plenty of job offers.

857
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:17,392
I'm not worried.
I'm embarrassed.

858
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:20,362
No one who knows you thinks you have
anything to be embarrassed about.

859
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:23,115
There's a pretty strong consensus
among people who don't know me

860
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:25,784
that I'm
"a stupid fucking libtard whore

861
00:40:25,818 --> 00:40:28,036
who should have been
dismembered on Boylston Street

862
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:30,572
after first getting
sodomized by a jihadist."

863
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:34,076
Pretty mild for the Internet,
but still.

864
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:40,465
I appreciate...

865
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,469
Charlie said that you did
everything you could to help me.

866
00:40:44,504 --> 00:40:47,422
Yeah.
And he knew we were dating.

867
00:40:47,424 --> 00:40:50,225
So he said he'd do it himself,
which was merciful.

868
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:52,427
Are you saying you
volunteered to fire me?

869
00:40:52,478 --> 00:40:54,479
I wasn't volunteering.
It was my job.

870
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,101
<i>Daily Beast</i>.

871
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:01,520
Some of the offers are gonna be
from people who don't like us very much.

872
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:03,488
Who doesn't like us?

873
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:06,425
Not you and me. ACN.
For some of the outlets,

874
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,694
being someone with an ax to grind
against us would be an asset.

875
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:10,779
I don't have an ax to grind.

876
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,701
Do you think that's
the reason I outed myself?

877
00:41:15,752 --> 00:41:17,619
Do I think... No.

878
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,504
I was trying to do the right thing.
You think I put it out there as bait?

879
00:41:19,539 --> 00:41:21,623
I'm saying don't get played.

880
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,797
<i>Gawker</i>.

881
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:39,775
I needed a minute to adjust.
That's all that happened.

882
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:42,611
I'd love to go to your parents'
40th anniversary party.

883
00:41:42,645 --> 00:41:45,197
There is no party.
I was testing you.

884
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:46,932
Are you for real?

885
00:41:46,966 --> 00:41:50,485
You did the exact same thing I did when
Maggie asked me to meet her parents.

886
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:55,290
You gave me a little test.

887
00:41:55,324 --> 00:41:57,159
You didn't do well.

888
00:41:57,161 --> 00:42:00,045
Is this something you read in <i>Cosmo</i>
while you were at the dentist?

889
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,496
Yes.

890
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:03,832
I said I'd go to the party
which doesn't exist

891
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:05,717
because you're a lying
liar who lies a lot.

892
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:07,586
It said the next thing
you'd do is deflect.

893
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:10,005
Don't you like having a gal
pal that you can hang out with

894
00:42:10,007 --> 00:42:12,074
where there are extra
benefits like stock tips?

895
00:42:12,108 --> 00:42:14,760
- I can't use the stock tips.
- Then how about the sex?!

896
00:42:24,404 --> 00:42:26,655
- Hey.
- Hey.

897
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:28,657
- Hey.
- Hi.

898
00:42:37,033 --> 00:42:39,868
- It would take a long time to explain.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

899
00:42:52,715 --> 00:42:54,382
- Yes.
- Yes what?

900
00:42:54,434 --> 00:42:57,686
Yes, I love having a gal pal with
no commitment and tons of sex.

901
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,221
- Great.
- Just not you.

902
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:02,107
- What's wrong with me?
- Plenty, but I really like you anyway.

903
00:43:02,141 --> 00:43:04,726
I'm not good
at not being alone.

904
00:43:04,777 --> 00:43:07,195
It's what I'm used to.

905
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,948
Let me know if you want
to get good at it.

906
00:43:12,902 --> 00:43:16,404
- The sex is good.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

907
00:43:16,456 --> 00:43:18,073
Invoking Leona Lansing

908
00:43:18,075 --> 00:43:19,875
is gonna get you
nowhere with me.

909
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:22,711
Our fidelity is to our father's legacy,
not his mother's.

910
00:43:22,745 --> 00:43:25,380
Then I can tell you this is
not what he would have wanted.

911
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:26,965
- Then fuck him, too, Charlie.
- Hey!

912
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:28,633
- All right.
- Why didn't our mother get shares?

913
00:43:28,668 --> 00:43:31,753
'Cause she's not the one
that raised $42,350.

914
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:33,472
<i>She didn't build the company.
She married it.</i>

915
00:43:33,506 --> 00:43:35,307
Yeah,
and like you poured the cement.

916
00:43:35,341 --> 00:43:36,975
As a matter of fact,
with an MBA,

917
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:38,844
he insisted on starting
in the mail room.

918
00:43:38,895 --> 00:43:42,430
I understand we were born on third base,
but I'm stealing home now.

919
00:43:42,432 --> 00:43:44,983
- So that's about it.
- Shh.

920
00:43:45,017 --> 00:43:48,353
I'm not here.
I don't want to interrupt anything.

921
00:43:48,404 --> 00:43:50,071
Good afternoon, Leona.

922
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:53,358
I'll tell you what.
Leona is for friends and family.

923
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:57,078
If you're trying to poach my company,
I'd prefer Mrs. Lansing.

924
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:02,834
Oh, Blair, you get more
beautiful every time I see you.

925
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:03,952
How often is that?

926
00:44:04,003 --> 00:44:06,254
As infrequently as possible.

927
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:09,791
I understand you've been out on
a date with Savannah Capital.

928
00:44:09,842 --> 00:44:11,426
And I let them take turns.

929
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,296
Oh, and, Randy,
you like to watch, right?

930
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:15,847
What?

931
00:44:15,882 --> 00:44:18,466
You know what happened
last month

932
00:44:18,518 --> 00:44:20,769
without anybody noticing?
This is for real.

933
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:25,056
Webster's Dictionary expanded the
definition of the word literally

934
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:27,776
to include the way
it's commonly misused.

935
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:29,811
So the thing is,
we no longer have a word

936
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:31,646
in the English language
that means literally.

937
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:33,648
I mean,
literally doesn't have a synonym.

938
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,501
So we're going to have to find
the Latin word for it and use it.

939
00:44:36,536 --> 00:44:38,119
But, see,
I don't know any Latin.

940
00:44:38,154 --> 00:44:41,122
So when I say that I am
literally gonna set fire

941
00:44:41,157 --> 00:44:44,860
to this building with you in it
before I hand over the keys to it,

942
00:44:44,894 --> 00:44:47,662
you don't know if I'm speaking
figuratively or literally.

943
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:50,665
Savannah's offering
$81 per share,

944
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:53,552
so if this is about money,
you'll accept 82 from me, right?

945
00:44:53,586 --> 00:44:55,754
- Mom.
- We're not interested in selling 6%.

946
00:44:55,805 --> 00:44:58,757
I'm not interested
in buying 6%!

947
00:44:58,808 --> 00:45:01,176
I don't want you anywhere
near this company.

948
00:45:01,227 --> 00:45:04,012
I want all of it.

949
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:07,682
I am offering you one full dollar
per share more than Savannah.

950
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:10,151
So if this is about the money,
you'll take it.

951
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,821
$2.

952
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,491
That's what I thought.

953
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:20,362
I'll raise the cash and have an offer sheet
to you before your birthday.

954
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:21,863
I tend to doubt it, but...

955
00:45:21,865 --> 00:45:24,866
Oh, get the fuck out
of my boardroom, kids.

956
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,871
Hey.

957
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:31,823
How come we couldn't be friends,
Blair?

958
00:45:31,857 --> 00:45:34,209
It's 'cause I can't stand you,
Mrs. Lansing.

959
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,962
You've got to lose that anger,
honey.

960
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:38,930
People get the face
they deserve.

961
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:40,432
See you in 10 days.

962
00:45:42,852 --> 00:45:44,052
Are you out of your mind?

963
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:47,555
$4 billion for
a $62 billion company?

964
00:45:47,557 --> 00:45:49,824
- It's a steal.
<i>- It's not!</i>

965
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:53,111
- But even if it were...
- Yeah?

966
00:45:53,145 --> 00:45:56,698
I think he's trying to say
you don't have $4 billion.

967
00:45:56,732 --> 00:45:58,149
How much do I have?

968
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,734
I don't know,
but it's somewhere in the ballpark

969
00:45:59,736 --> 00:46:02,487
of nothing close to $4 billion!

970
00:46:04,373 --> 00:46:07,575
Charlie, did I ever tell you
about the time my parents saw

971
00:46:07,627 --> 00:46:09,794
<i>You Can't Take It With You</i>
on Broadway?

972
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:11,496
That was $42,000.

973
00:46:11,547 --> 00:46:15,050
No, $42,350.

974
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:18,303
And it was the last 350
that were the hardest.

975
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:20,555
Sold my clothes,
dealt a little weed.

976
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:23,224
- Mom.
- Oh, I'm just kidding. I didn't sell my clothes.

977
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:26,428
- This is for real.
- You think I don't fucking know that?

978
00:46:28,397 --> 00:46:32,183
I need $4 billion
cash right now.

979
00:46:35,988 --> 00:46:38,440
I don't know who this guy is.
I didn't vote for him.

980
00:46:38,474 --> 00:46:41,192
I don't want him making decisions on
his own about what's best for America.

981
00:46:41,243 --> 00:46:43,611
For all I know, he's one bad day
away from being Ted Kaczynski.

982
00:46:43,663 --> 00:46:46,948
We work with the FBI and the DOD to
determine what needs to be redacted.

983
00:46:46,999 --> 00:46:48,917
They're going to say
everything needs to be redacted.

984
00:46:48,951 --> 00:46:52,087
They know they have to convince me why.
And if I'm not sold...

985
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:54,456
But just to get that far,
you have to call BCD, right?

986
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:56,424
- To comment.
- That's it. That's the trip wire.

987
00:46:56,459 --> 00:46:59,844
You call BCD and Neal has to give up
his source or face a contempt charge.

988
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:02,547
<i>There's no route to the right
thing that doesn't include the possibility...</i>

989
00:47:02,598 --> 00:47:04,799
<i>The certainty
of a contempt charge.</i>

990
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:07,135
<i>The route to the right thing
is this guy showing his face.</i>

991
00:47:07,137 --> 00:47:09,471
<i>Why is Neal paying the price
for this guy's patriotism?</i>

992
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:10,772
<i>But we're past that.</i>

993
00:47:10,806 --> 00:47:12,140
<i>And if I could switch places with him,
I would.</i>

994
00:47:12,191 --> 00:47:13,892
<i>And I would tell
you the same thing,</i>

995
00:47:13,943 --> 00:47:16,311
<i>that a contempt charge could be the least...
Too many people...</i>

996
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,480
Look at how many people
are in this room.

997
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:20,281
They're in this room
'cause they can be trusted.

998
00:47:20,316 --> 00:47:23,702
Too many people already know that a
more serious crime has been committed.

999
00:47:23,736 --> 00:47:25,153
<i>The FBI doesn't know that.</i>

1000
00:47:25,204 --> 00:47:26,705
<i>- What if they find out?</i>
<i>- How?</i>

1001
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:28,156
<i>The only other person
who knows is the source,</i>

1002
00:47:28,158 --> 00:47:29,290
<i>and he's not showing his face.</i>

1003
00:47:29,325 --> 00:47:31,159
- <i>What if he does?</i>
<i>- He won't.</i>

1004
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:33,161
<i>So you completely trust a guy who
the only thing that we know about him</i>

1005
00:47:33,212 --> 00:47:35,747
is that he stole classified documents
from the Department of Defense?

1006
00:47:35,798 --> 00:47:37,549
We are three exits
past that on the highway.

1007
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,584
<i>I don't know why
this is a discussion.</i>

1008
00:47:39,635 --> 00:47:41,870
<i>We obviously have
to pursue this story</i>

1009
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:44,639
and we need to start right now.

1010
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:47,175
Wait here a second.

1011
00:47:47,177 --> 00:47:50,595
Jenna,
I want you to put some menus on my desk.

1012
00:47:50,646 --> 00:47:53,348
Three minutes after they get here,
I want you to come into my office

1013
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:54,849
and ask for the menus back.

1014
00:47:54,851 --> 00:47:56,434
And that's it.
You got it?

1015
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,355
- After who gets here?
- Trust me.

1016
00:48:12,752 --> 00:48:14,452
In the time that
you've been working here,

1017
00:48:14,503 --> 00:48:16,871
have you ever asked yourself why
we always walk into the studio

1018
00:48:16,922 --> 00:48:20,175
through that door when we could just
walk straight in over that threshold?

1019
00:48:20,209 --> 00:48:22,677
I did ask after I noticed it.

1020
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:24,295
What'd they say?

1021
00:48:24,346 --> 00:48:26,848
They said it was superstition.

1022
00:48:26,882 --> 00:48:28,266
It's my superstition.

1023
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,301
Never asked
anyone else to do it.

1024
00:48:30,352 --> 00:48:32,437
They just did.

1025
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:35,607
It's a longer walk.
I kind of feel responsible for that.

1026
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:39,060
You feel responsible
for a lot of things.

1027
00:48:39,111 --> 00:48:42,313
You already called BCD, right?

1028
00:48:42,364 --> 00:48:44,232
A few hours ago when you
went to the bathroom,

1029
00:48:44,283 --> 00:48:47,235
you were really calling
BCD for comment.

1030
00:48:47,237 --> 00:48:49,204
Yeah.

1031
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:51,156
You can do the story
or not do the story,

1032
00:48:51,207 --> 00:48:55,743
but now a decision can't be made
that considers my protection.

1033
00:48:55,745 --> 00:48:57,829
I gave them my name.

1034
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:02,417
For a long time
after you started here,

1035
00:49:02,468 --> 00:49:05,336
I didn't know your name.

1036
00:49:05,387 --> 00:49:07,255
You called me Punjab.

1037
00:49:07,257 --> 00:49:11,092
Yeah, you know, I...

1038
00:49:11,094 --> 00:49:13,178
I sure know it now.

1039
00:49:16,182 --> 00:49:18,183
Thank you.

1040
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:19,934
Do something for me, would you?

1041
00:49:19,936 --> 00:49:22,737
- Sure.
- Give me the source.

1042
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:24,355
I need some skin in the game

1043
00:49:24,406 --> 00:49:27,192
and they're gonna have a trickier
time of it with my profile.

1044
00:49:27,243 --> 00:49:29,244
They'll need a day
to figure out what to do

1045
00:49:29,278 --> 00:49:30,662
and negotiate
with me and Rebecca.

1046
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:32,947
- Yeah, all right.
- One more thing.

1047
00:49:32,998 --> 00:49:35,950
Do you have anyplace you can
get to for a day or two?

1048
00:49:36,001 --> 00:49:37,535
It won't come to that.

1049
00:49:37,586 --> 00:49:40,338
Someplace you can get to
without using a credit card.

1050
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:42,924
I can't tell if you're kidding.

1051
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,459
Leave your phone
at home by accident.

1052
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:46,427
Greyhound doesn't need
to know your name.

1053
00:49:46,462 --> 00:49:48,129
You know what I'm saying.

1054
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:50,265
It's just contempt.

1055
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:53,101
Why don't you go transcribe
your notes from the call to BCD

1056
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:55,220
and distribute them
in the conference room?

1057
00:49:58,807 --> 00:50:01,276
Neal Sampat.

1058
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:10,451
- Hello.
- We're on a break in there.

1059
00:50:10,486 --> 00:50:12,370
Don and I are a couple.

1060
00:50:12,404 --> 00:50:13,955
We've been seeing
each other for a few months.

1061
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:16,908
You can tell anybody you want
and you can use the word couple.

1062
00:50:18,327 --> 00:50:20,211
- Don, what's going on?
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

1063
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:21,913
Okay.

1064
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:27,719
I would love to go to
your parents' made-up party.

1065
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:29,304
Are you just saying that
because it's made up?

1066
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:31,806
Because I would love to go on a
made-up hike with your cousins.

1067
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,260
No, I'm saying it because
I'm in love with you.

1068
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,064
I love you, Don.

1069
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:42,734
You don't have to
say anything back.

1070
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:49,407
- I...
- Ha, ha, ha!

1071
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:50,825
Oh, shit!

1072
00:50:50,859 --> 00:50:52,360
You have been tested
and you failed that test.

1073
00:50:52,411 --> 00:50:54,412
I did not do well on that test.

1074
00:50:54,446 --> 00:50:56,698
- You bit down hard.
- I failed that test.

1075
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,534
As long as you know that.

1076
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:00,919
Are you worried about
getting scooped?

1077
00:51:00,953 --> 00:51:02,203
- No.
- Yes.

1078
00:51:02,205 --> 00:51:04,038
Because now I got to trust
that somebody else

1079
00:51:04,089 --> 00:51:06,341
is going to handle
the story responsibly.

1080
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:08,293
What if whoever
the source goes to next

1081
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:11,095
just makes a 27,000-page
document dump?

1082
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,547
Nobody elected you either.

1083
00:51:12,598 --> 00:51:15,300
I agree there's a kink in the system,
but look at me.

1084
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:18,636
Have you ever seen a more
trustworthy person in your life?

1085
00:51:18,687 --> 00:51:19,887
I was born like this.

1086
00:51:19,889 --> 00:51:22,690
By the way,
how much money do you have?

1087
00:51:22,725 --> 00:51:24,859
In the bank?

1088
00:51:24,893 --> 00:51:27,195
Yeah, in an unrelated matter,

1089
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:29,731
Leona's gonna need,
like, $4 billion

1090
00:51:29,782 --> 00:51:32,483
or this network's
gonna be liquidated.

1091
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:34,452
What was that?

1092
00:51:34,486 --> 00:51:36,404
Don't worry about it right now.

1093
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:49,634
I'm Special Agent Hutchinson
and this is Special Agent Levy.

1094
00:51:49,668 --> 00:51:51,886
We're with the FBI and we
need to question Neal Sampat.

1095
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,255
<i>We also have a search warrant
under seal for your hard drives.</i>

1096
00:51:54,306 --> 00:51:57,308
- Mac.
- I understand you two know each other socially?

1097
00:51:57,343 --> 00:51:59,344
I was telling Agent Hutchinson

1098
00:51:59,395 --> 00:52:01,679
I think we haven't seen
each other since Christmas.

1099
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,598
Yeah, that's right.
It was...

1100
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,768
It wasn't Christmas Eve,
it was the night before.

1101
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:08,436
I'm Charlie Skinner.
I'm in charge.

1102
00:52:08,438 --> 00:52:10,104
A warrant under seal
means you're prohibited

1103
00:52:10,106 --> 00:52:11,656
<i>from disclosing
that you were served.</i>

1104
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,107
<i>If you disclose
that you were served...</i>

1105
00:52:13,158 --> 00:52:14,993
- Agent Hutchinson, I'm...
- You're Rebecca Halliday.

1106
00:52:15,027 --> 00:52:16,778
<i>You're the attorney
for Mr. Sampat.</i>

1107
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,246
Yeah.

1108
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,249
I represent ACN
in First Amendment matters.

1109
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:24,619
You should answer your phone.

1110
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,005
It's going to be
the attorney general.

1111
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:30,925
Rebecca Halliday.

1112
00:52:30,959 --> 00:52:32,510
Which of you is Neal Sampat?

1113
00:52:32,544 --> 00:52:33,961
Our lawyer has
just stepped away.

1114
00:52:34,013 --> 00:52:35,963
I have a warrant,
Mr. Skinner.

1115
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:39,350
- Your lawyer knows...
- I'm Spartacus, sir. Neal's not in the room.

1116
00:52:39,385 --> 00:52:41,786
Why don't we go in my
office for a minute?

1117
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,971
I want to talk to them alone.

1118
00:52:43,973 --> 00:52:46,107
Prepare the search,
but don't start.

1119
00:52:46,141 --> 00:52:48,860
You know how many hard
drives we have in this place?

1120
00:53:01,824 --> 00:53:03,541
Keep your voices very low.

1121
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:05,326
You didn't tell me it was this.

1122
00:53:05,328 --> 00:53:08,129
I don't know what this is, Molly,
and I told you as little as possible.

1123
00:53:08,163 --> 00:53:10,965
I have to say, raiding a newsroom has
got to be damn near unprecedented.

1124
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:13,551
We need to find this guy.
This is a bad guy.

1125
00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:14,886
We can't take
your word for that.

1126
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,971
And as you well know,
bad guys are good sources.

1127
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:19,173
We want to work with you
on this story and we want...

1128
00:53:19,224 --> 00:53:21,676
We want to work with you, too,
but we're going to question Neal Sampat.

1129
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:23,678
<i>The attorney general is on the
phone telling your lawyer</i>

1130
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:25,596
<i>we're gonna hold him till
he gives up his source.</i>

1131
00:53:25,647 --> 00:53:27,432
And I'll tell you what else.

1132
00:53:27,483 --> 00:53:30,151
There are three levels of Internet
systems the government works on.

1133
00:53:30,185 --> 00:53:31,736
This guy was working on JWICS

1134
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,488
and we don't believe
he has the ability

1135
00:53:33,522 --> 00:53:35,273
to transfer content
to the protocol router.

1136
00:53:35,324 --> 00:53:37,358
So if we can prove
your guy helped him do it,

1137
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,943
he's getting charged
with a full boat.

1138
00:53:38,994 --> 00:53:41,362
He's going to Leavenworth.

1139
00:53:41,413 --> 00:53:44,782
So if you want to work with us,
let's start.

1140
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:47,835
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

1141
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,704
- I just need your menu.
- Sorry.

1142
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:52,423
We're working
through dinner tonight.

1143
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:54,709
Are we allowed to buy
your guys dinner?

1144
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,544
No.

1145
00:53:56,546 --> 00:53:58,179
Thanks.

1146
00:53:59,681 --> 00:54:02,717
Molly,
I know the name of the source, too.

1147
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:05,186
- You do?
- Yeah.

1148
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,472
- Who else?
- That's it.

1149
00:54:09,108 --> 00:54:11,392
We need to start searching
your hard drives now.

1150
00:54:11,443 --> 00:54:14,028
We won't talk anymore till
your lawyer's in the room.

1151
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,742
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1152
00:54:29,711 --> 00:54:31,579
- What's going on?
- Welcome back.

1153
00:54:31,581 --> 00:54:33,664
Sloan, what's going on?

1154
00:54:33,715 --> 00:54:36,634
<i>It's about Neal's story...</i>

1155
00:54:38,003 --> 00:54:39,921
Go ahead.

1156
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:42,974
Please step away
from the desks.

1157
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:45,426
Could someone please tell me
where Neal Sampat works?

1158
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:51,265
He works over there.

1159
00:55:56,023 --> 00:55:58,327
