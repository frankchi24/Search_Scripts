No, I called you.

I just meant that that's why...

16
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,020
That's why my voice
sounds like this.

17
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:27,439
That's why I'm being quiet.

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,275
Yes, sir. Yes, Catherine.
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,188
Everything all right?

26
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,690
Remember the night
before you went to prison?

27
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:06,694
The power was out
in the apartment.

28
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,363
Oh, yeah.
Definitely.

29
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,951
What?

30
00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:17,072
- What?
- You heard me.

31
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:19,791
No, I didn't. Your mouth was moving,
but you didn't make sounds.

32
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:21,576
That was my doctor on the phone

33
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:23,828
with the results
of a blood test.

34
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,585
Ellen!

35
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:32,204
_

36
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:34,005
Ellen!

37
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,423
He means you.

38
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:37,809
Excuse me, sir.
Do you mean me?

39
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,677
Who the hell do I mean
when I say your name?

40
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,930
I'm Maggie. Margaret.
Maggie's fine.

41
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:43,431
I need Ellen.

42
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:46,684
Does anyone know
someone named...

43
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:49,487
I don't think there's
anyone here named Ellen.

44
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:51,756
I can't keep track.
Karen I think her name is.

45
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,525
I don't think there's anyone
named Karen here either.

46
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,577
My assistant.
She sits right over there.

47
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:58,830
- I'm your assistant now. You promoted me last week.
- I have no memory of that.

48
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,366
You fired Ellen and then forgot that
you did and thought I was Ellen.

49
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:03,451
- Is this tie all right?
- It's very sharp, sir.

50
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:05,620
I'm not your platoon leader.
Please don't call me sir.

51
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:07,205
- Do you have good taste?
- In what?

52
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:10,041
Clothes. Do people generally
say you have good taste?

53
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:11,759
- Pretty good.
- Okay, don't take this the wrong way,

54
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,845
but what you're wearing right now,
is that because you like it

55
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,463
or is it because
that's all you can afford?

56
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,849
A little of both, I guess.
There was a sale at...

57
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:20,635
Get me some more ties and someone who
knows what they're talking about.

58
00:04:20,637 --> 00:04:22,220
Sure.

59
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,108
Don, the storm is now causing
record flooding in New England.

60
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,360
- We'll drop that into the copy.
- And clear out the block.

61
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,029
- The whole block?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

62
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,815
- That means throwing out Moscow.
- Remind me.

63
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:36,684
A pair of suicide bombers
attacked two subway stations.

64
00:04:36,752 --> 00:04:38,820
38 dead. Officials think it
was Chechen rebels fighting...

65
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:42,123
Record flooding, FEMA's saying 200,000
people in Rhode Island could be affected.

66
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:44,325
Yeah, it's raining in Providence.
Everyone's gonna be okay.

67
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:47,078
- You really want the whole block?
- Yes.

68
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,913
60 seconds.

69
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,721
They just called 60.
You need to clear the studio.

70
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:00,008
- You asked to see me.
- Sorry, tell me your name again.

71
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:02,060
- Neal Sampat.
- Neal, I need the guy who edits our website.

72
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,679
- That's me.
- All right.

73
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:07,649
It's been several days
since I asked Don Keefer

74
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,817
to have the website
do a poll on Obamacare

75
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,686
so I could do a segment
on the poll.

76
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:13,988
Yeah, Don spoke to me
about that and I wasn't sure

77
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,907
what kind of poll question
you were looking for.

78
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,442
- Really?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:19,194
Do you favor Obamacare?

80
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:21,329
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

81
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,580
What's the problem?

82
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:24,866
For one thing,
it hasn't been implemented yet.

83
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:26,784
I know that.

84
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:29,170
It's just that polling is a science
and this wouldn't be a proper...

85
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:30,421
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,123
If you want to spend
the money on polling...

87
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:34,042
Just ask the question,
give the answer to graphics.

88
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:36,878
They'll put it up on the screen,
I'll talk about it with a guest.

89
00:05:36,929 --> 00:05:39,347
I'm just trying to protect
the integrity of the website.

90
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,715
It's a website.
It doesn't have integrity.

91
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:42,600
You need to clear the studio.

92
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,720
<i>- 10 seconds.</i>
- Yeah.

93
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:54,529
<i>In three, two, one. Roll in.</i>

94
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,158
Good evening.
I'm Will McAvoy.

95
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,627
This is <i>News Night</i>
for April 2, 2010.

96
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,246
We've got a great show tonight.

97
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:12,830
You're gonna be happy
you landed here.

98
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:15,083
<i>Record flooding

100
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,920
<i>We're gonna put you

101
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:20,672
<i>Three men have been

103
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:24,976

<i>You won't want to miss it.

106
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:32,517
<i>You're watching </i>News Night<i> on ACN,
so stick around.</i>

107
00:06:34,987 --> 00:06:37,105
<i>Clear.</i>

108
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,519
Name that tune.

109
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,305
Play a little more.

110
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:14,809
Tom T. Hall.
"That's How I Got to Memphis."

111
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,894
You do play a little guitar on the side.

112
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:19,197
I do a little news
anchoring on the side.

113
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,898
Since when do you
listen to country?

114
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,901
My grandson Bo, Katie's oldest,
has a garage band.

115
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,903
Ask me what instrument
he plays.

116
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,989
- Guitar.
- All of them.

117
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:29,707
Seriously, he's a savant.

118
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:33,511
You put an instrument in his hands,
give him a day, and he can play it.

119
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:36,381
So I was at their house
last weekend

120
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,416
and I wander out to the garage

121
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:41,502
and see Bo teaching
"That's How I Got to Memphis" to his friends.

122
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:43,838
And I ask him,
"What's a kid from New Rochelle

123
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,723
doing singing
about Memphis?"

124
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:49,177
He said,
"Memphis is a stand-in

125
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:50,845
for wherever you are right now.

126
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,181
That it really means
that's how I got here."

127
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,734
- Will.
- Yeah?

128
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:03,241
You did a five minute and 20 second
block on the weather tonight.

129
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:05,026
Weather rates.

130
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:08,663
- I saw you're speaking at Northwestern.
- Yeah.

131
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,199
- To journalism students.
- Yeah.

132
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:15,086
Are you going to tell the
kids that weather rates?

133
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,954
- What do you want from me?
- The news.

134
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:19,791
I've got the second highest
rated newscast on cable.

135
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:21,209
I don't give a shit.

136
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,928
I know that, Charlie.
That's why I have to.

137
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:28,549
Have you ever thought
about having kids?

138
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,967
You mean adopting?

139
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:31,602
Adopting, abducting.

140
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,439
Meeting somebody, getting married.
Whatever it takes.

141
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,607
I haven't considered
abducting anyone,

142
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,776
- but I've thought about the others.
- And?

143
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,728
Well, first of all,
I'm now in my 50s

144
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,447
and I need to consider
that I'm gonna die

145
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,032
and will my kid be old enough
to handle it when I do?

146
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:48,152
There's no age at which you're
okay with your father dying.

147
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:49,987
But there's a difference
between being an adult

148
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:51,906
and dropping a piano on a kid.

149
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:55,243
You don't look to me like
you're gonna die anytime soon.

150
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,962
And if you got hit
by an ice cream truck,

151
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,248
they'd still have you
as a father for a while.

152
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,916
Yeah,
I'm not sure that's a prize.

153
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,584
Why?

154
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:05,136
I've read plenty
of experts who say

155
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,889
that whatever undiagnosed
shit my father has

156
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,257
can be hereditary.

157
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:11,592
Your father's an alcoholic,
you're not.

158
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:13,428
I'm talking about...

159
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,097
He's obviously lived his life with
some kind of severe depression.

160
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:18,983
Your depression isn't chemical.

161
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,935
- Who says I'm depressed?
- I do.

162
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:23,738
Will, you're so much better
than the show you're doing.

163
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,440
I'm tired of this.
It's the second highest...

164
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:28,776
Highest rated hour
of congratulations.

165
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:31,829
Palm Sunday mass
in St. Peter's Square,

166
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,948
Benedict tells tens
of thousands of people,

167
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,700
as well as the rest
of the world,

168
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,702
about the recent
petty gossip...

169
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:39,787
His words...
That he's been subjected to.

170
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:42,457
That he's been subjected to.

171
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:45,760
Petty gossip.
He's talking about proven allegations

172
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,962
that priests have
been raping children

173
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:50,882
and that bishops,
archbishops, cardinals,

174
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,767
and maybe even this pope

175
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,936
have been protecting
the children?

176
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,139
No, the priests.

177
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,808
Benedict fails to mention
that in his sermon,

178
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,977
which is bad enough,
but you failed

179
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:06,113
to mention that
in your report Monday.

180
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,982
And that's inexplicable to me.

181
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,650
Bill Donohue...

182
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,986
Yeah, you don't want the
Catholic League mad at you.

183
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:13,237
Nobody does.

184
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,823
The president in his first
visit to Afghanistan

185
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:17,742
as the president
meets with Hamid Karzai.

186
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:21,245
And then I couldn't believe the words
that came out of your mouth next.

187
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:24,799
"We'll have two
top campaign strategists

188
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,835
here in the studio to debate
the war right after this."

189
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:31,255
- They were good guests.
- What in the hell are we doing

190
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,508
having two campaign hacks

191
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:36,677
from the D-triple-C
and the RNC on our air

192
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,729
debating America's longest war

193
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:41,516
when you know as well
as I know that they know

194
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,569
exactly as much as what's printed
in their talking points?

195
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,187
Who would you have preferred?

196
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:50,107
Anybody from AEI,
Brookings, Heritage, Cato.

197
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:52,660
Anybody from State or Defense.

198
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,580
Anybody from House or
Senate Foreign Relations.

199
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:57,915
At the very least
you could get the guy

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,283
who wrote the talking points.

201
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:00,835
There's a midterm
election coming up.

202
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,703
In six months.

203
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,292
So why do you book
a red guy and a blue guy?

204
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,630
For the fight.

205
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,051
I'm starting to enjoy our
postshow drinks less and less.

206
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:21,138
- I'll back off.
- Thank you.

207
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:23,641
- For tonight.
- I'll take what I can get.

208
00:11:23,692 --> 00:11:25,560
And remember what I said.

209
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:28,062
You said a lot of things.

210
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:31,532
Being a father.
It lives up to the hype.

211
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:40,575
<i>♪ Amen. ♪</i>

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,917
Hey.

213
00:11:49,968 --> 00:11:51,836
Yeah.
Sorry.

214
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:57,658
Amazing service.

215
00:11:57,693 --> 00:11:59,510
Thank you.
Thank you.

216
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:05,933
Okay, please help me. I need to fully
understand what's happening right now.

217
00:12:05,984 --> 00:12:09,403
I'm seven weeks pregnant and there's like
a five in nine chance that it's yours.

218
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:11,606
I don't care if there's no chance it's mine.
It's mine now.

219
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:13,274
- Couple of questions.
- Give them to me.

220
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:14,859
Are you feeling all right?
Should you be standing up?

221
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,661
Is it all right for you
to be outdoors?

222
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:18,779
I feel great and I'm allowed to be
outdoors for the first eight weeks.

223
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,532
- Feels like that was a joke, but I can't tell.
- It was.

224
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,118
Moratorium on jokes for the
next week and seven months.

225
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,203
Have you had an amnio?

226
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:28,923
In between getting off the
phone and talking to you?

227
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,459
No, I was going to use the
amnio room in the chapel,

228
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,294
but they were out
of really long needles.

229
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:35,212
What rule did I just
make about jokes?

230
00:12:35,263 --> 00:12:37,181
I don't think you're gonna
be making rules for a while.

231
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,551
Amnio's at 16 weeks.
We do a blood test for Down's at 10 weeks.

232
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:42,553
- Down's?
- Yeah, there are some scary parts.

233
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:46,190
But, Billy, my hCG levels
were 220,000, which is good.

234
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,442
- It's a strong pregnancy.
- 220,000 is good?

235
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,645
- It's very good.
- Is there such a thing as 221,000?

236
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,346
This is gonna be
a long seven months.

237
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,898
- No, it's gonna be great. You know why?
- Don't say it.

238
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:55,866
I'm gonna be
in charge of morale.

239
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,451
Do we know if
it's a boy or a girl?

240
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,987
Yep. There's a good chance it's
gonna be one of those two.

241
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,878
I know.

242
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,214
I can't believe
he's not here for this.

243
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,001
- It was a nice service.
- It was.

244
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:16,671
- Yeah. I thought you were gonna do the eulogy.
- Yeah.

245
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:19,256
Yeah, I was.
I asked his brother to do it.

246
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:21,509
Okay.

247
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,345
Mac, take a ride with me
to the cemetery, will you?

248
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,514
- Sure.
- Mac, Mac, Mac.

249
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:28,733
Yes?

250
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,235
I think maybe we should just put
you in a hospital bed right now

251
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,570
and hook you up to an epidural.

252
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:33,938
- Would that be premature?
- Yes.

253
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,573
Okay.

254
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:44,165
- We're gonna ride with you.
- We?

255
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,250
Hi.

256
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,919
Sure.

257
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,457
That was a nice service.

258
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,410
Episcopalians know
what they're doing.

259
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:31,378
I thought Will was gonna
give the eulogy, but...

260
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,047
- Pipe down a second.
- Okay.

261
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:37,885
Terry Smith wants me
to come down

262
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,671
and interview for a field
producer job in DC.

263
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:45,593
A field producer job in DC.

264
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,646
I know.

265
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,064
How do you know?

266
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,899
I'm the one
who recommended you.

267
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,567
When?

268
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,236
Yesterday.

269
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,438
She called and said,
"Who's ready for a promotion?

270
00:14:57,489 --> 00:14:59,106
Who's the best
you've got?"

271
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,408
I said Gary.
Then Tess.

272
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,194
Kendra, Tamara, then Martin.

273
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:06,080
And then I said, "But Maggie Jordan
is the sixth best we've got.

274
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,200
You couldn't do any better than Maggie
unless you went with one of the other five."

275
00:15:10,585 --> 00:15:12,119
I'm kidding.

276
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,754
I said,
"You've got to take Maggie."

277
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,343
Well, I have to go down
to DC tomorrow to interview.

278
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,429
You're gonna get it.

279
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:39,563
- You've got a problem, my friend.
- I know.

280
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:42,316
"Lucas Pruit Thinks Women
Are Worth Less Than Men."

281
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,401
That's a bullshit headline.

282
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:46,320
You own a company
called Kwench.

283
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:49,440
- Yeah.
- K-W-E-N-C-H.

284
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:51,992
You know that's not how
you spell that word, right?

285
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:54,995
Kwench makes personalized soft drinks.
It's a personalized word.

286
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,047
I hardly understood
that sentence at all.

287
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,632
- Did you?
- Me?

288
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,301
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

289
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,753
Valleywag is reporting
pay inequity at Kwench.

290
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,338
How do you know we're
underpaying the women?

291
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,056
How do you know we're
not overpaying the men?

292
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,676
That is definitely
the argument I'd use.

293
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:12,012
77 cents on the dollar
isn't a job-to-job figure.

294
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:15,065
It's a specious statistic.
Women leave the workforce at different times.

295
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,017
They also don't
negotiate as hard.

296
00:16:17,068 --> 00:16:18,853
I'm supposed to
volunteer extra money

297
00:16:18,904 --> 00:16:21,522
because I'm playing baseball
and they're playing T-ball?

298
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:24,158
When you control for
literally everything,

299
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,661
single versus married, whether or not they have kids,
the pay gap doesn't go away.

300
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:31,282
And most people don't have jobs
where they negotiate their salary.

301
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,419
I still don't know
what I'm doing here

302
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,672
- or what a personalized soft drink is.
- It's a millennial...

303
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,042
You know, the pay gap problem
would probably go away

304
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:44,461
if it weren't for punch two
of the one-two punch.

305
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,796
Such bullshit, Leona.

306
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:47,932
Two days ago the story
from Valleywag comes out

307
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,967
saying you pay women
at Kwench less than men.

308
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:53,220
And then yesterday a story
in <i>The New York Observer</i>

309
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:56,724
says you hired hookers
for your 35th birthday party.

310
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:59,226
It didn't say that.
It said I hired models for my party.

311
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:01,562
- Mm. Any of the models men?
- No.

312
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:04,732
So you hired young women
to be guests at your party.

313
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:06,867
- It's not uncommon.
- It's not?

314
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:08,452
Were these women
given dress codes?

315
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,321
The whole party
had a dress code.

316
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:12,039
The invitation said
suggested dress.

317
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,290
You got hold of an invitation?

318
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,793
So was the dress code
for these young women

319
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,578
suggested or was it mandatory?

320
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,129
The women
weren't hired for sex.

321
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,215
I don't expect you
to understand this.

322
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,418
They were hired
to be living art.

323
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:28,088
First of all,
you shouldn't expect anyone to understand that.

324
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:31,425
Second, you need to know that
every time you try to explain it,

325
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:34,144
you just make it worse.

326
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,230
So I'm gonna help you today.

327
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,233
You are?

328
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,651
Yeah.

329
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,071
Is it like a can of cola
with your initials on it?

330
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,522
No.

331
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:52,413
Um... Ahem.

332
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,949
We think you need to know
exactly what happened.

333
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,750
Mm-hmm.

334
00:17:58,503 --> 00:18:01,288
Things were bad
while you were in jail.

335
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,375
<i>Pruit was implementing
his vision for the network</i>

336
00:18:04,426 --> 00:18:06,760
and Charlie had kind of
thrown in the towel.

337
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,762
Thrown in the towel isn't right.
That's not fair.

338
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,848
He'd, you know, given up.

339
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,933
- That's what throwing in the towel means.
- It doesn't matter.

340
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,469
We...
Don, Mac, and myself,

341
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,721
but mostly Don...
had been fighting with Charlie a lot.

342
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:20,391
On Monday night I did an
interview with this guy Bree,

343
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:23,227
who had been hired by Pruit to run
ACN Digital while Neal's gone.

344
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:25,779
Bree is... a dick.

345
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:28,866
- Yeah, the website is an abomination.
- It is, yes, an abomination.

346
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,285
<i>One part of it in particular,
in fact.</i>

347
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,987
<i>An app that assists
violent criminals.</i>

348
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,873
And Monday night I interviewed
Bree about the app.

349
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:36,991
Pruit was happy
about this interview

350
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:38,826
because it would draw
attention to the website

351
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:41,378
<i>and Charlie was happy about it
because Pruit was happy about it.</i>

352
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,631
But in the interview itself,
I ripped the app apart

353
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,834
and Bree and the network
along with it

354
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:50,504
and in a manner that made Charlie
angrier than I'd ever seen him in...

355
00:18:53,058 --> 00:18:55,259
ever, really.

356
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:01,515
And it was a few minutes later
that he had a heart attack.

357
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,188
But there's another part of the story
that Don's going to tell you about

358
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:10,107
that strongly suggests
it was him and not me

359
00:19:10,158 --> 00:19:12,693
that precipitated the death of our
very close friend and leader.

360
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:14,828
Do you want to hear Don tell
you that part of the story?

361
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:17,197
Yes, I do.

362
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,668
Okay.

363
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:31,045
Excuse me,
are you MacKenzie McHale?

364
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,298
You are.
I recognize you.

365
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:37,301
- I'm Charlie Skinner.
- Sure, I know.

366
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:40,971
I called your office,
but you don't work there anymore.

367
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:44,274
I was able to get in touch
with your friend Jim Harper

368
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,561
and he told me that
at 11:00 AM on a Monday

369
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:50,647
I could find you at the
Lucky Strike Bowling Lanes.

370
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,036
Then he said,
"Yeah, you heard me right."

371
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,539
And that was pretty much it.

372
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,744
You're serious about bowling?

373
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,712
I just took it up recently.

374
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,082
I bowled a strike once
when I was a little girl

375
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:09,716
and it seems to me
if you can do it once,

376
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,668
then you should be able
to do it 12 times in a row,

377
00:20:11,719 --> 00:20:13,253
which would be a perfect game.

378
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:16,173
So that's what
I'm trying to do.

379
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:18,142
I don't want to stop you.
Go ahead.

380
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:39,496
- I hooked it.
- A little bit.

381
00:20:41,082 --> 00:20:43,867
You like to drink
in the middle of the day?

382
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,953
I'm still on Afghanistan time,

383
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:48,505
I'm unemployed,
and I'm in sweatpants at a bowling alley.

384
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,708
I heard you had
some trouble in Fallujah.

385
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,260
That was a long time ago.

386
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:56,013
Five months.

387
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,382
I got stabbed

388
00:20:58,433 --> 00:21:00,384
in the abdomen.

389
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:03,437
They sewed me up.
The budget cuts hurt worse.

390
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:06,190
You're expensive.

391
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,308
You may have priced yourself
out of your own career.

392
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,811
I offered to cut my salary 35%.

393
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:13,030
I'm not what's expensive
about foreign coverage.

394
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,365
Have you thought about
a studio job again?

395
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,368
I've dreamt about that,
being an EP again.

396
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,739
There was nothing
in Atlanta or New York,

397
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,626
so CNN gave me permission
to explore other options,

398
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,078
and it turns out
I don't have any.

399
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:31,665
Nothing here in DC, London.

400
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:34,168
I may be down, but I'm not out.

401
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,087
I'm gonna qualify for the ladies'
professional bowling tour.

402
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,890
I don't think you are.

403
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,009
- Based on one frame?
- Yes.

404
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:44,728
Well, haters gonna hate.

405
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,813
That's not your first
beer today, is it?

406
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,515
I'm not sure,

407
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,602
but I think the reason
I've been drinking lately

408
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:54,605
is to numb the feeling
of despair.

409
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:58,108
If you were thinking clearly, you
probably would have asked me by now

410
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,327
why I came down
to Washington to talk to you.

411
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,598
Hang on.

412
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:07,284
Yeah, that's for sure
what I would have done.

413
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,705
I want you to take over
<i>News Night</i>.

414
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:15,509
Hmm?

415
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,379
Excuse me, can you tell me
where Don Keefer's office is?

416
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,548
It's right over there.
You see the name on the door?

417
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,550
Thank you.

418
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:31,608
<i>Come in.</i>

419
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:33,560
Good morning. I'm Sloan Sabbith.
I work on dayside.

420
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,396
Yeah, I know you.
<i>Market Rip-off With Sloan Sabbith</i>.

421
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:39,316
- <i>Wrap-up</i>.
- I'm kidding. It's just what we call...

422
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:41,235
- Yeah.
- It's not a joke about you or the show.

423
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:42,736
- I understand.
- It's more about how the banks play it

424
00:22:42,787 --> 00:22:44,488
a little fast and loose
with subprime mortgages.

425
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,206
It's fine.
On dayside we call you

426
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,492
the executive producer of
<i>Train Wreck With Will McAvoy</i>.

427
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:51,578
It's not as clever
as <i>Market Rip-off</i>

428
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,880
'cause it doesn't have the same
alliterative relationship to the...

429
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,582
You know what?
How can I help you?

430
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:57,718
Friday night you had
Rothstein on.

431
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:01,088
It was right after the totally newsworthy
segment on the season finale of <i>24</i>.

432
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:03,707
It was the series finale.
And do you have a problem with Jack Bauer?

433
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:05,225
I've got a problem
with Jake Rothstein

434
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,127
and now I've got a problem
with Will McAvoy.

435
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,879
Sounds like your problem with
Will started before last night.

436
00:23:08,913 --> 00:23:10,897
It did,
but that's neither here nor there.

437
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,567
Rothstein said it's perfectly
legitimate for their firm,

438
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,019
referring to Goldman,
to have sold off those toxic assets

439
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,487
that were exposing
them to risk.

440
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,940
"The people who bought them from
us should have known better."

441
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:21,742
- You did that without notes.
- Yeah.

442
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:24,361
And you know what McAvoy's follow-up was?
"We'll be right back after this."

443
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:26,113
You'd have liked to have seen
a tougher follow-up.

444
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:28,282
- Tougher?
- You'd have liked to have seen a tough follow-up.

445
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,118
Or any.
How about this...

446
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:33,787
Wasn't the twisted brilliance of the
big banks that they managed to conceal

447
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:35,789
a bunch of subprime mortgages
inside a collection

448
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,175
of other more legitimate
mortgage-backed securities?

449
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,294
- That wasn't a loaded question?
- I'll deload it.

450
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,713
How would these customers know
that these assets were toxic

451
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:45,015
since the established companies
gave them a triple-A rating?

452
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,134
You have your own show and you're free to
ask your guests any questions you'd like.

453
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:50,020
And I would have,
but my guest, Jacob Rothstein,

454
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:53,440
was poached by your booker so your
boss could ask him if he watches <i>24</i>.

455
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:56,893
This is one of the people who caused the
crash and is freely roaming the countryside.

456
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:59,196
Sloan, you came down here
and insulted my anchor

457
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,315
and demanded to know why we didn't
prepare a better interview.

458
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:03,650
Let me add this
to the conversation.

459
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,736
For two years I've been
listening to people like you

460
00:24:05,787 --> 00:24:08,572
say they can't believe no one's been
prosecuted for these Wall Street crimes,

461
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:10,791
and after two years,
I'm still fuzzy on what crime was committed

462
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:11,992
and who should be
prosecuted for it.

463
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,877
You're a financial
news reporter

464
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,796
who gets to spend
an hour on one subject

465
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,714
and I'm at least
an average consumer of news

466
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,417
and you have failed to get me to
understand what you've called

467
00:24:20,468 --> 00:24:22,502
the most important story
of the last 10 years.

468
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:25,672
So after you get done telling me how
badly we did our job last night,

469
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:29,026
you may want to do an internal
investigation of your own work.

470
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,261
Visit us any time you want.

471
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,349
I have to disclose to you
that I have a previous

472
00:24:35,351 --> 00:24:38,318
relationship with Will McAvoy.

473
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:42,189
A social relationship.

474
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,359
Romantic.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

475
00:24:45,361 --> 00:24:47,861
I do, and it's excruciating.

476
00:24:47,912 --> 00:24:50,947
I know about that
and I couldn't care less.

477
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:53,867
I've watched tape
and during the short time

478
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:56,953
you two worked together at CNN,
you were onto something.

479
00:24:57,004 --> 00:24:58,872
You had the beginning
of something good.

480
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:01,124
Part of the reason was
we had a news director

481
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:04,461
who was willing to say one segment
for you and one segment for me.

482
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,930
I'm a news director
who's going to say

483
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,932
one hour for you
and nothing for me.

484
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,550
Why?

485
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:13,220
'Cause what you want and what
I want are the same thing.

486
00:25:13,271 --> 00:25:17,441
I want to do an hour of news
that's a genuine public service.

487
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:20,060
- That's what I want.
- Something worthy of a great nation.

488
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:22,028
- Mm-hmm. Yes.
- There was a time when journalism

489
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,314
- wasn't a career, it was a calling.
- No. That's right.

490
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:28,118
- And you agree?
- We've been agreeing with each other for a little while now.

491
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:33,740
I'm taking on a job on a new
afternoon talk show called <i>Lunch</i>.

492
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:36,126
I'm sorry?

493
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,379
I'm executive producing
a new daytime talk show

494
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:41,915
where five people discuss
the issues of the day

495
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:44,501
as well as lunch,
which will be prepared before our eyes.

496
00:25:44,552 --> 00:25:47,170
- That's your calling?
- No, it's not my calling.

497
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:48,805
I'm wearing sweatpants.
I need a job.

498
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,807
I'm offering you a better one.

499
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,144
I'm not sure it's a better one.

500
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,764
I've been watching Will's descent
into complete surrender for years.

501
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,015
You can change that.

502
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,684
Like it's every
little girl's dream

503
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:02,235
to make a man
better at his job.

504
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,521
You know,
you're not exactly slaying 'em

505
00:26:04,572 --> 00:26:06,490
in the aisles here
at Lucky Strike.

506
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,910
Michael Schumacher
was the Formula 1 champion

507
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,195
for five years in a row.

508
00:26:12,246 --> 00:26:14,831
And I think even the biggest
Michael Schumacher fan

509
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:18,368
would have to admit that it's because
he was driving the fastest car.

510
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:23,173
Will may have been at his
best when you were his EP.

511
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,843
But I'd remind you that you were at
your best when he was your anchor.

512
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,297
I'm offering you a fast car.

513
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:32,549
It's a bit
of a fixer-upper.

514
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,468
All of us are.

515
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,686
What happens to Don Keefer?

516
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:40,390
He moves to 10:00 where
Elliot Hirsch is taking over.

517
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,809
Don's a smart guy and from
what I hear a good EP.

518
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:44,478
What makes you think
I'll have better luck

519
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,531
than Don making
your car go fast?

520
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:50,200
Because Will doesn't care
about impressing Don.

521
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,454
You're not offering me the job in
spite of my history with Will,

522
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,206
you're offering it
to me because of it.

523
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,125
I'm offering it to you
because you're my best hope

524
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,796
of turning our flagship news hour
into something we're proud of.

525
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:09,719
He hasn't returned
any of my calls

526
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:12,672
or emails or letters in...

527
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:17,561
years.

528
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:20,680
I don't think he's that interested
in what I think of him.

529
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:25,318
That may be the only thing
he's interested in.

530
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:33,527
An offer's on the table.

531
00:27:33,578 --> 00:27:35,745
Midterms are in six months

532
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,498
and another presidential
campaign in two years.

533
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:41,201
Take the offer and you'll have
a chance to frame the debate.

534
00:27:41,252 --> 00:27:43,003
Or pass.

535
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:46,039
But then you never get to
complain about the news again.

536
00:27:50,928 --> 00:27:53,380
Keep your wrist straight.

537
00:28:07,695 --> 00:28:09,563
Thank you.

538
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,568
<i>There you go, one ticket.</i>

539
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:16,202
<i>Next.</i>

540
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,905
- McHale.
- McHale.

541
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:20,957
M-C-H.

542
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,742
<i>There you go.
All set.</i>

543
00:28:22,793 --> 00:28:24,961
- Thank you.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

544
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,664
<i>Next.</i>

545
00:28:29,717 --> 00:28:32,419
Two tickets.
They're under Jennifer Johnson.

546
00:28:45,483 --> 00:28:46,983
Are you going
to ask a question?

547
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:48,935
If I can.

548
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,941
You mind if I ask
what you're going to ask?

549
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,410
We were told the questions
weren't going to be screened.

550
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,829
Oh, I don't work here.
I was just...

551
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:02,782
- I'm curious.
- Oh.

552
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,451
It's a stupid question.

553
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:06,703
- I'm sure it's not.
- No, it is.

554
00:29:06,754 --> 00:29:08,955
It's just with everything...

555
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:12,759
We're coming out of school and I'm
looking for a reason to be optimistic,

556
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,011
so I wanted to ask
all three of them

557
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:18,715
what they think makes America the
greatest country in the world.

558
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,053
You're going to ask that
to all three of them?

559
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,771
Yeah.

560
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,698
If you follow me
when we get inside,

561
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:37,784
I'll show you the trick to being
the first in line at a microphone.

562
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:40,036
All right.

563
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,499
<i>- I have a plan, Leona.
- I'm not improvising.</i>

564
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,001
I've been up all night with the most
expensive PR people in New York.

565
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:57,337
I'm gonna speak to the 10,000 Women
Initiative at the Clinton Foundation.

566
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:00,924
I'm sponsoring the Matrix Awards for
Women Leadership in Communication.

567
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:04,227
And <i>Business Insider</i> is gonna do a
profile on me in which I will be likable.

568
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,848
There's something I don't
think you're understanding.

569
00:30:08,899 --> 00:30:11,017
What's that?

570
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,236
You have a PR problem

571
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,572
because you have
an actual problem.

572
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,529
Still don't know why I'm here.

573
00:30:22,531 --> 00:30:25,031
It was a story Charlie wanted
because it was a story Pruit wanted

574
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:26,866
and I pretended we couldn't
find the Princeton student

575
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:28,451
<i>so we wouldn't have
to do the segment.</i>

576
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:30,370
Charlie knew I was lying,
he knew why I was lying.

577
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:31,871
And I knew he knew
why I was lying.

578
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:34,257
It was a showdown and he lost.

579
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,792
Yes, he did.

580
00:30:35,843 --> 00:30:38,044
Yeah.

581
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:40,630
- MacKenzie was not ineffectual.
- No?

582
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:43,266
- No, she was very much in the fight.
- How so?

583
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,934
She, too,
was beating up Charlie.

584
00:30:47,188 --> 00:30:51,024
Okay, should we go bury him or do you
guys feel like you did that already?

585
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,311
- We should go.
- We should bury him now.

586
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:03,319
I was expecting more
along the lines of,

587
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,572
"Don't beat yourself up.
Of course it's not your fault."

588
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:08,158
He can get pretty creative
with revenge.

589
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:20,503
- Maggie.
- Hey.

590
00:31:20,554 --> 00:31:22,505
I know it's the wrong place,
but congratulations.

591
00:31:22,556 --> 00:31:25,508
I heard they're bringing you down to DC
to interview for a field producer job.

592
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,060
Yeah, tomorrow.

593
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,262
- Good luck. You're gonna get it.
- Thanks.

594
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,264
You want it, right?

595
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,266
Definitely.

596
00:31:34,902 --> 00:31:38,772
Should I care that Jim was the
one who recommended me for it?

597
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,491
You mean because
it takes you out of town?

598
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,778
After three years, we started
dating three days ago.

599
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:47,747
No. The answer is no.
You shouldn't care.

600
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,116
Right.

601
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,754
What are you smiling about?

602
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,793
This is the stuff that drove
Charlie out of his mind.

603
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:02,345
He'd appreciate that we're
still doing it at his funeral.

604
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,681
No, he wouldn't.

605
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,300
I know, but...

606
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:10,470
you know.

607
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,390
Yeah.

608
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,366
<i>All right, yeah,
you, sorority girl.</i>

609
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,369
<i>In case you accidently wander
into a voting booth one day,</i>

610
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,404
<i>there's some things you should
know and one of them is</i>

611
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:31,457
<i>there is absolutely no evidence
to support the statement</i>

612
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,042
<i>that we're the greatest
country in the world.</i>

613
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:35,662
<i>And with a straight face
you're gonna tell students</i>

614
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,997
<i>that America is
so star-spangled awesome</i>

615
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:40,717
<i>that we're the only ones
in the world who have freedom?</i>

616
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,335
<i>If liberals
are so fucking smart,</i>

617
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,637
<i>how come they lose
so goddamn always?</i>

618
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:47,557
<i>So when you ask what makes us the
greatest country in the world,</i>

619
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,392
<i>I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.</i>

620
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:52,345
<i>Yosemite?</i>

621
00:32:52,396 --> 00:32:54,063
<i>My name is Jenna.
I'm a sophomore.</i>

622
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,933
<i>And this is for all three of you.</i>

623
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:03,907
I thought I saw someone I knew in the
audience and she was prompting me.

624
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,441
I was asked a question
from the audience

625
00:33:05,492 --> 00:33:07,527
and she wrote
an answer down on a pad

626
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:09,913
and pointed to it
the way a producer would.

627
00:33:09,997 --> 00:33:11,915
But it was a hallucination.

628
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:15,251
Which I didn't think those really happened,
but they do.

629
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,036
Never doubt them again.

630
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,705
Hmm.

631
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,378
You're not as helpful
as your movie counterparts.

632
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,017
<i>Oui?</i>

633
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:36,940
You Mr. McAvoy?

634
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,391
Yeah.

635
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,493
Phone call for you.

636
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,981
- Hello?
<i>- I made Charlie give me the number.</i>

637
00:33:45,032 --> 00:33:47,116
- Leona?
- Are you all right?

638
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,402
- <i>Is this Leona?</i>
- Yeah.

639
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,988
- I'm sorry.
<i>- What happened?</i>

640
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,456
I don't know.

641
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,408
You cursed
at a college student.

642
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,877
<i>Yeah, I know this is
embarrassing for you...</i>

643
00:33:57,912 --> 00:33:59,963
I'm not worried
about me, I'm...

644
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:02,332
You've made a career
out of being likable.

645
00:34:04,885 --> 00:34:07,470
I'd like to make a career
out of doing the news.

646
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,143
Leona?

647
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,930
Who's stopping ya?

648
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:29,359
<i>We were able to be all these
things and do all these things</i>

649
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,611
<i>because we were informed.</i>

650
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:34,163
<i>By great men.
Men who were revered.</i>

651
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,952
<i>The first step
to solving a problem is...</i>

652
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:42,755
Hello?

653
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,290
<i>Charlie?</i>

654
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:47,460
<i>Speaking.
Who's this?</i>

655
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:48,845
It's MacKenzie.

656
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,764
- MacKenzie.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

657
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,133
- <i>Look...</i>
- Yes.

658
00:34:54,184 --> 00:34:57,804
- <i>What was that?</i>
- I'm in.

659
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,394
Yeah?

660
00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:07,230
Markets rely on Standard & Poor's
to objectively rate debt.

661
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:09,115
But the companies that want
a favorable debt rating

662
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,034
are the same companies
that pay Standard & Poor's.

663
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,819
- You follow so far?
- Yeah.

664
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,455
Banks wrote a ton of bad mortgages to
people they knew were going to default.

665
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:16,990
<i>It's called predatory lending.</i>

666
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,708
Then hid those bad mortgages
inside good mortgages

667
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,327
to shine up the books for S&P,
which gave them triple-A ratings.

668
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:23,796
Then they'd bundle the whole
thing and sell the debt

669
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,965
to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
which is owned by...

670
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,633
- You and me.
- Yes.

671
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:30,003
And then the banks bet
on those loans defaulting.

672
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:32,221
<i>Not that much different from
fixing a college basketball game</i>

673
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:34,807
except a ton of people
wind up broke and homeless.

674
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,259
Those people can't buy
things anymore,

675
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,928
so businesses start going out of
business and more people are broke.

676
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:41,347
When you start eliminating consumers,
you start eliminating jobs,

677
00:35:41,398 --> 00:35:42,732
which eliminates consumers,
which eliminates jobs,

678
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,567
which eliminates consumers,
and you see where this is going?

679
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,019
I'm no longer the EP
of <i>News Night</i>.

680
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:47,687
What happened?

681
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:49,939
Charlie's bringing in a new EP

682
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,608
and I'm moving to 10:00 where
Elliot Hirsch is taking over.

683
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:55,445
I'm sorry.

684
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,948
Will blew
the Rothstein interview.

685
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:02,335
He doesn't like to appear rude
except when he's not on TV.

686
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:07,206
We'd have done everyone a favor if
we had let you keep him as a guest.

687
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,293
Have a good night.

688
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:11,928
Yeah, you, too.

689
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:24,223
Service elevator is broken.

690
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,975
That's no problem.

691
00:36:29,029 --> 00:36:32,899
Would it be forward if I asked a man
if he wanted to get a cup of coffee?

692
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,369
I was kind of in his face and then it
turned out he got a demotion, so...

693
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:40,073
And if he says no, then I've got to
come to work with him every day.

694
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:43,793
You want coffee?

695
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,879
No.
That's very nice of you.

696
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:26,119
<i>Listen and watch.</i>

697
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:42,135
- Hello?
<i>- It's MacKenzie. Let me up.</i>

698
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,155
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

699
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:03,823
What happened here?

700
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:05,458
Most of the furniture
was Audrey's.

701
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,660
<i>Some of it was mine,
but she liked it.</i>

702
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:09,495
And so you gave away
your furniture?

703
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:12,081
- Seemed like the least I could do.
- She didn't take it well.

704
00:38:12,132 --> 00:38:14,417
She called me a Lost Boy.
That's <i>Peter Pan</i>, right?

705
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:16,886
- Yeah.
- Like I'm fighting Indians and pirates?

706
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,754
- Is that what she meant?
- No.

707
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:21,174
Long-distance relationships
don't ever work, ever.

708
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:22,975
Do you know one that's worked?

709
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,179
- John and Abigail Adams.
- We don't know that that worked.

710
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,681
They wrote nice letters
for a while,

711
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:30,600
but they could have
grown distant.

712
00:38:30,651 --> 00:38:32,435
Audrey took a job in Baltimore.

713
00:38:32,486 --> 00:38:34,086
- <i>I know.</i>
- That's a 45-minute drive.

714
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:36,939
The mileage wasn't
the important thing.

715
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,692
- You wanted to break up with Audrey.
- That was the important thing.

716
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:42,411
Charlie Skinner wants me to
take over <i>News Night</i> at ACN.

717
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:45,865
I'm doing it and I want you to come
with me and be our senior producer.

718
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:50,036
Say that again.

719
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:53,039
I'm taking over <i>News Night</i> and
I want you to be my second.

720
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,793
What, are you doing cleanup after
what happened at Northwestern?

721
00:38:57,844 --> 00:39:00,179
Actually, I don't think Northwestern
needs to be cleaned up.

722
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:01,964
No, we're just going
to start over.

723
00:39:02,015 --> 00:39:04,183
What would be your idea
of a good newscast?

724
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:07,470
One that wasn't required to
care that much about revenues.

725
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:10,223
Me, too, but that would take a news
director who felt the same way.

726
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:11,974
Right.

727
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:14,527
Jim, Charlie Skinner
is on some kind of mission.

728
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:17,563
He's dead serious.
He messengered a book to me...

729
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:20,066
It would take more
than a news director.

730
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,951
- Will McAvoy...
- Comes with an audience.

731
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,488
And, trust me,
you have no idea what he can do.

732
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:28,708
<i>He has a gear
you've never seen.</i>

733
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,326
So what was the book?

734
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,078
The book?

735
00:39:32,129 --> 00:39:33,746
You said Charlie Skinner
was on a mission

736
00:39:33,797 --> 00:39:36,132
<i>and that he messengered
you some book.</i>

737
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:38,622
_

738
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:57,186
Listen up.
In the past, if you came to me

739
00:39:57,237 --> 00:39:59,105
with tips for healthy living,
you might have found something

740
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:02,491
in the tone of my response that discouraged
you from ever saying that again.

741
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:04,360
But now I'm issuing
a whole new decree.

742
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,779
I want your health advice.
It's suddenly very important

743
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,615
to me that I live
for a long time.

744
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,684
Jesus!

745
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,925
What happened?

746
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,128
<i>- I'm not sure.</i>
<i>- I have no idea.</i>

747
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:24,130
Smack me in the face as hard as you can.

748
00:40:24,181 --> 00:40:25,965
- I'm not kidding.
- Why?

749
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,883
- You won't hurt me, I promise you.
- No, I can't.

750
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,519
- I can.
- Do it.

751
00:40:30,604 --> 00:40:32,054
I was wrong.
That hurt.

752
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:35,358
But do that if you ever see me put
a cigarette in my mouth again.

753
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,027
- Neal's plane landed.
- All right, Neal's plane landed!

754
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,231
- Why suddenly?
- What?

755
00:40:42,282 --> 00:40:45,034
You said it was suddenly very
important that you live a long time.

756
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,737
- Did I?
- Yeah.

757
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:50,239
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

758
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,957
- Hang on.
- Oh, my God.

759
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,592
- What?
- Will!

760
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:55,661
I think there's a rule about
this and I may have stumbled...

761
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:58,331
- Are you serious?
- ...into an area where I'm not sure of the law

762
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,833
and I'm gonna get approval
before commenting any further.

763
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,835
This conversation never happened except
for the slap and the cigarettes.

764
00:41:02,886 --> 00:41:06,305
Tess, Tamara, Kendra,
just record right over it in your brain.

765
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,208
Martin doesn't have a clue,
so we're not going to worry about that.

766
00:41:09,242 --> 00:41:13,129
Respect the boss. You know,
employee fear of being punished at work.

767
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,320
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

768
00:41:21,355 --> 00:41:23,689
Excuse me.

769
00:41:23,691 --> 00:41:26,108
I've just had a
conversation with someone

770
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,078
I'm only allowed to identify
as a senior member of ACN.

771
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,363
- This person told me...
- Sloan?

772
00:41:30,414 --> 00:41:31,747
A senior member of ACN.

773
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:33,866
You're standing
in front of a mirror

774
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:37,169
and 10 feet behind you is Sloan,
who's monitoring the conversation.

775
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,538
You want me to join you?

776
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:40,756
You told him what I told you?

777
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,541
- It had to be done.
- It so didn't.

778
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:45,044
You think that because I
recommended you for the job in DC

779
00:41:45,095 --> 00:41:47,430
that I don't care that
you might move to DC?

780
00:41:47,514 --> 00:41:49,548
- I never said that.
- It's easy to interpret as a soft breakup.

781
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:51,217
- I don't even know what that is.
- He does.

782
00:41:51,268 --> 00:41:53,052
- It's a promotion, Maggie.
- I know.

783
00:41:53,103 --> 00:41:54,887
It's field producing.
It's what you want to do.

784
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:56,639
- She knows.
- What are you still doing here?

785
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,557
I'm brokering this thing
because we're all

786
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:00,476
a little tired of you two
missing such easy shots.

787
00:42:00,527 --> 00:42:01,811
Things aren't as complicated
as you make them.

788
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:03,863
You're dating
my ex-boyfriend, right?

789
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:06,065
- Yeah.
- Okay.

790
00:42:06,116 --> 00:42:08,534
I wasn't doing you a favor.
I was doing them a favor.

791
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,120
But you didn't even
mention anything like

792
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,706
it'll mean we're not living
in the same city. Bummer.

793
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,158
Really? Bummer was what
you were looking for?

794
00:42:16,209 --> 00:42:18,994
Not bummer. Not...
You know what I'm saying.

795
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:20,463
- You know what she's saying.
- Sloan.

796
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,581
- Something better than that.
- Can we have a minute?

797
00:42:22,632 --> 00:42:24,049
Yeah.

798
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:28,087
I don't want this
to get out of hand.

799
00:42:28,138 --> 00:42:30,506
- I recommended you...
- Wait. I...

800
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,258
I don't want this
to get out of hand.

801
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,677
We kissed on the plane
three nights ago.

802
00:42:34,728 --> 00:42:36,262
It's only been three nights.

803
00:42:36,264 --> 00:42:38,814
And, yes, we've slept
together every night since.

804
00:42:38,899 --> 00:42:41,851
We talked about having a night
of celibacy in honor of Charlie,

805
00:42:41,902 --> 00:42:43,936
but then we both made
pretty strong arguments

806
00:42:43,938 --> 00:42:45,604
why he wouldn't have
wanted it that way.

807
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:47,239
I'm not delusional.

808
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:50,860
I don't think
this is more than it is.

809
00:42:50,911 --> 00:42:52,361
Don't panic.

810
00:42:54,164 --> 00:42:57,032
And I really appreciate
the recommendation.

811
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:03,622
So things got rough
Monday night?

812
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:06,375
Sloan Sabbith conducted an interview
that embarrassed the network.

813
00:43:06,426 --> 00:43:08,677
She tore apart our website.
She tore apart our app.

814
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:11,514
She tore apart the guy who's running
the website who designed the app.

815
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,349
And she did it with
MacKenzie's approval.

816
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,167
How am I supposed
to not fire them both?

817
00:43:15,202 --> 00:43:17,303
Do you still want me here?

818
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:20,222
You know,
there were times when I thought

819
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:22,475
if I was at Charlie
Skinner's funeral,

820
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:24,360
it'd be because I'd killed him.

821
00:43:26,029 --> 00:43:27,980
If you're not fighting
with your news director,

822
00:43:28,031 --> 00:43:29,782
you're not doing your job.

823
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,317
And if they're not
fighting with you,

824
00:43:31,368 --> 00:43:33,903
they're not doing their job.

825
00:43:33,954 --> 00:43:35,821
Because the truth is,

826
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:38,324
you don't want the ACN
you think you do.

827
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:41,994
If you got it,
you'd be like the dog that caught the car.

828
00:43:42,045 --> 00:43:45,464
You want the ACN that makes
as much money as these naive,

829
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:48,250
financially illiterate
journalists will let you make.

830
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:52,721
But if I were you,
I would find the one person I know

831
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:56,258
who will argue with you
until you fire them.

832
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:58,761
And keep on arguing with you

833
00:43:58,812 --> 00:44:01,347
until security escorts them
from the building.

834
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:05,184
But what does this have to do
with your current problem?

835
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:08,938
Yeah.

836
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:10,689
Do you even know what the
fuck we're talking about?

837
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,107
Not as such, no.

838
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:16,362
<i>The Hurt Locker</i>.

839
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:18,414
- Come on.
<i>- The Hurt Locker</i>.

840
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,199
It won Best Picture.
It beat <i>Avatar</i>.

841
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,001
Ugh, <i>Avatar</i> should be second.

842
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:25,087
<i>The Hurt Locker</i> and
<i>Avatar</i> are both overrated?

843
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,705
<i>Gravity</i>.
Take this down.

844
00:44:26,756 --> 00:44:29,675
Listening to everyone rave about it
beyond the score and visual effects

845
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,627
<i>was like overhearing
an inside joke</i>

846
00:44:31,678 --> 00:44:34,964
that only well-respected movie
critics were really in on.

847
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:36,682
- Put it up.
- If you say so.

848
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,634
<i>The Descendants</i>.
The problem with <i>The Descendants</i>

849
00:44:38,685 --> 00:44:40,553
<i>is that it sucked.</i>

850
00:44:43,023 --> 00:44:44,890
What just happened?

851
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:46,442
- What the hell?
- We get hacked?

852
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:49,311
No, this wasn't a hacker.
Somebody just walked right in.

853
00:44:52,983 --> 00:44:54,700
I shut it down from my phone.

854
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,321
- Are you Neal?
- Yeah.

855
00:44:59,372 --> 00:45:00,990
Welcome back, man.

856
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,659
"The Nine Most Overrated
Movies of All Time."

857
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,629
- We thought it would be fun.
- For who?

858
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:09,548
For movie fans.
Look, I know this...

859
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,684
And I saw you went all the
way back to <i>The Matrix</i>.

860
00:45:11,718 --> 00:45:14,803
- Yeah.
- 1999.

861
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,388
Yeah.

862
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:19,425
All time and 14 years

863
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:21,093
are two different
units of measurement.

864
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:23,228
But my question
is why is overrated

865
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:26,515
more fun than, say, underrated?

866
00:45:28,985 --> 00:45:31,770
You embarrass me.

867
00:45:31,821 --> 00:45:33,439
I what?

868
00:45:33,441 --> 00:45:36,358
It took me a long time
to build ACN Digital.

869
00:45:36,409 --> 00:45:38,827
I was laughed at by the
people in this newsroom.

870
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:41,614
People I respect didn't respect
what I did around here,

871
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:43,248
but I built this into a tool

872
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,117
that gathered, expanded on,

873
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,120
and disseminated
information that's useful.

874
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:50,756
I kept telling my
colleagues and my bosses

875
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,791
that the Internet is user
sensitive just like most things.

876
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:56,795
And I've watched from 1,000 miles
away while you proved that.

877
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:03,252
You embarrass me.

878
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,025
Build a page that says
the site's down for repair.

879
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,645
- For an hour?
- For a week.

880
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:14,446
We're gonna rebuild
the whole thing.

881
00:46:16,282 --> 00:46:18,050
I'm sorry about
Charlie Skinner.

882
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:22,738
Thank you.

883
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,634
What are you doing?

884
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:39,088
I'm just looking at the
bedroom of a small boy.

885
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,842
We've got to finish the renovation
on the apartment and then sell it.

886
00:46:43,893 --> 00:46:45,894
We need a house with a
pile of leaves in front

887
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,147
on a flat street
where he can ride a bike.

888
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:50,182
You didn't speak at the burial.

889
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:54,019
- Yeah.
- You were going to say a few words.

890
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:55,404
- I know.
- What's going on?

891
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,106
I just don't know what to say.

892
00:46:57,157 --> 00:46:59,942
Every time I think of something,
it's reductive.

893
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,030
Well, I think everyone would like
to hear from you before they leave.

894
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,379
I've put something
aside to give you.

895
00:47:20,381 --> 00:47:22,247
- Mrs. Skinner.
- Nancy.

896
00:47:22,282 --> 00:47:23,515
Nancy.

897
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:28,887
I have to tell you I may have
contributed to Charlie's heart attack.

898
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:31,440
I may have caused it.

899
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:34,560
There was a story Charlie wanted me
to do and I didn't want to do it.

900
00:47:34,594 --> 00:47:37,563
And he got angry and...

901
00:47:37,614 --> 00:47:39,198
Are you talking about
the Princeton student?

902
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:41,784
Am I... Yeah.

903
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:44,036
He didn't want to do
that story either.

904
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:47,573
He was praying you were
gonna fight him on it.

905
00:47:47,624 --> 00:47:49,825
The last seven weeks
were hell for him

906
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:52,044
since Leona sold
the network to Pruit.

907
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:55,714
He wasn't angry that
you guys were fighting him.

908
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:58,250
He was counting on it.

909
00:47:58,284 --> 00:48:01,837
He loved you, Don.
And he was so proud of you.

910
00:48:02,806 --> 00:48:04,973
I doubt you killed him.

911
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:07,092
That had to be hard
to say to me

912
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:10,979
and I appreciate it,
but I don't care.

913
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:14,266
I care what you did for him
while he was alive.

914
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:18,771
Anyway, this is silly,
but I want you to have it.

915
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:33,786
Thank you.

916
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:43,128
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

917
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:53,138
- How you doing?
- My grandfather died.

918
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,610
Well, you know, kid, I'm sorry,
but I've got my own problems.

919
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:00,145
My best friend died.

920
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,115
Wait a second.

921
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:05,951
You think there's a chance we're
talking about the same person?

922
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,654
You know we are.

923
00:49:08,705 --> 00:49:10,239
Where's your brother Bo?

924
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,157
He's probably in the garage.

925
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:14,042
He's always there.
He's got a band.

926
00:49:15,295 --> 00:49:17,629
- Would you take me to him?
- Sure.

927
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:34,680
- Bo.
- Hey. Hello.

928
00:49:35,648 --> 00:49:36,849
The place looks great.

929
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:39,268
Thanks.
We're pretty good.

930
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:42,404
Not great, but maybe one day.

931
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,273
Yeah?
You mind?

932
00:49:44,324 --> 00:49:45,941
No.

933
00:49:45,992 --> 00:49:48,026
That's right,
you play guitar on the side.

934
00:49:48,077 --> 00:49:50,445
I'm a news anchor on the side.

935
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:57,703
Listen,
can I ask you something?

936
00:49:57,754 --> 00:49:59,371
Sure.

937
00:49:59,373 --> 00:50:01,924
Was he...

938
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:04,426
Between the time
he had the heart attack

939
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,044
and the time he died,

940
00:50:06,095 --> 00:50:08,263
do you think he would have
been in a lot of pain?

941
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:13,135
You know, that's exactly the kind
of question he'd have asked.

942
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,188
They'd have sedated him.

943
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:18,106
You think he was scared?

944
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,927
I wasn't there.

945
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:24,613
When it happened,
I wasn't there.

946
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:30,986

Will, MacKenzie says it's time
to head back to the studio.

988
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,025
Thank you.

989
00:53:13,282 --> 00:53:16,284
I know your parents'
divorce has been tough.

990
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,871
I know you talked to your
grandfather about it a lot.

991
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:24,076
I'd be good at that, too.

992
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:26,328
Or if you just want
to play music.

993
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,580
Thanks.

994
00:53:33,386 --> 00:53:35,253
Come on, Ned.

995
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,841
- Wonderful service.
- It was, wasn't it?

996
00:53:39,892 --> 00:53:42,027
- I'm so glad you came.
- Oh, God...

997
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,849
There he is.
Will.

998
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,734
By any chance,
did you tell anyone about the pregnancy?

999
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:51,903
No, absolutely not.
You're not supposed to do that

1000
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,688
- till after the first semester.
- Trimester.

1001
00:53:53,739 --> 00:53:56,441
Tess, Kendra, Tamara,
and Martin tricked me into telling them.

1002
00:53:56,492 --> 00:53:58,110
Congratulations, you guys.

1003
00:53:58,161 --> 00:54:00,662
That's gonna be
one good-looking kid.

1004
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,280
And then they might
have told some people.

1005
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:05,117
- Will, could I have a word?
- Yeah.

1006
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:09,671
You know what I always thought
would be fun if I was a parent?

1007
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:12,457
You teach your kid something
wrong like wood comes from birds

1008
00:54:12,508 --> 00:54:14,543
<i>and you see how long
you can keep it going.</i>

1009
00:54:14,594 --> 00:54:16,294
They're all grown up
and at a dinner party

1010
00:54:16,345 --> 00:54:18,463
and people are admiring
the table and your kid says,

1011
00:54:18,465 --> 00:54:20,348
"It took a lot of sparrows
to make that table."

1012
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:23,301
But people have
different parenting styles.

1013
00:54:23,352 --> 00:54:25,804
There's no right way
or wrong way.

1014
00:54:25,855 --> 00:54:27,556
Maybe there's a wrong way.

1015
00:54:27,607 --> 00:54:30,976
- What was that?
<i>- We should go to the car.</i>

1016
00:54:30,978 --> 00:54:32,894
You're not going
to be reductive.

1017
00:54:32,945 --> 00:54:34,896
- Are you sure you don't want to say anything?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1018
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:36,431
Okay.

1019
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:39,117
Excuse me!

1020
00:54:39,152 --> 00:54:41,219
Excuse me.
Excuse me, everybody.

1021
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:44,823
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I just want to say... People...

1022
00:54:44,825 --> 00:54:47,125
I've been trying to piece together
what happened last Monday night.

1023
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,961
People have been
giving me their accounts.

1024
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:53,632
Seems everyone feels
responsible for Charlie dying

1025
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,667
and, of course, that's ridiculous.
It was Sloan.

1026
00:54:57,337 --> 00:55:00,422
Charlie Skinner was crazy.

1027
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:02,557
He identified with Don Quixote,

1028
00:55:02,592 --> 00:55:06,761
<i>an old man with dementia who
thought he could save the world</i>

1029
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:10,265
<i>from an epidemic of incivility
simply by acting like a knight.</i>

1030
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,518
His religion was decency.

1031
00:55:13,569 --> 00:55:16,855
And he spent a lifetime
fighting its enemies.

1032
00:55:21,277 --> 00:55:23,612
I wish he could be here

1033
00:55:23,663 --> 00:55:26,915
to learn the name of his
successor like I just did.

1034
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:32,921
Our new boss,
the new president of ACN,

1035
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:35,006
is MacKenzie McHale.

1036
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:43,098
So this fight
is just getting started.

1037
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,352
'Cause he taught the rest
of us to be crazy, too.

1038
00:55:49,939 --> 00:55:52,190
You were a man, Charlie.

1039
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:56,061
You were a great, big man.

1040
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:06,821
Let's go through the
rundown in five minutes.

1041
00:56:10,476 --> 00:56:12,127
Come in.

1042
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,746
- You wanted to see me?
- I'm promoting you.

1043
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:18,500
You're taking over as executive producer
of <i>News Night</i> starting Monday.

1044
00:56:20,336 --> 00:56:22,420
Mac, I think you should
offer it to Don.

1045
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:24,639
It was his job and I think
he's earned it back.

1046
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:26,591
I offered it to him.
He wants to stay at 10:00.

1047
00:56:26,642 --> 00:56:29,594
He said he's onto something,
he and Elliot, and he wants to keep going.

1048
00:56:29,645 --> 00:56:31,596
And he said he likes
having the last word.

1049
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:34,649
No, it's yours, Jim.

1050
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:36,851
ACN's flagship show.

1051
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:40,772
I won't let you down.

1052
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:43,742
You never have.

1053
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:55,620
- Cancel the interview in DC.
- Why?

1054
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:57,289
I'm the new EP of <i>News Night</i>

1055
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,424
and my first move is making
you senior producer.

1056
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,459
Seriously?

1057
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,961
Yeah.

1058
00:57:03,012 --> 00:57:04,963
Congratulations!

1059
00:57:04,965 --> 00:57:07,132
- That's sensational.
- Thank you.

1060
00:57:07,183 --> 00:57:09,134
I...

1061
00:57:11,187 --> 00:57:13,271
I...

1062
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:15,140
I'm incredibly flattered,

1063
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:18,143
but I'm going to interview
for the other job.

1064
00:57:18,145 --> 00:57:19,978
Why?

1065
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,147
I want to be a field producer.

1066
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:24,282
It's DC.
I'll be in line for the White House.

1067
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:27,152
Is this because I
recommended you for the job

1068
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:28,987
- and then wasn't upset enough that you...
- No.

1069
00:57:29,038 --> 00:57:31,373
Then why wouldn't you want
to be senior producer?

1070
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:34,326
I want to be a field producer.

1071
00:57:34,328 --> 00:57:36,594
It's DC.
I'll be in line for the White House.

1072
00:57:36,629 --> 00:57:39,998
- Did you not hear me the first time?
- Fine.

1073
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,083
- Fine?
- It was a big deal.

1074
00:57:42,134 --> 00:57:44,552
I don't care
how many days it's been

1075
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:46,004
and I'm not delusional either.

1076
00:57:46,006 --> 00:57:49,974
It is more than it is.

1077
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,764
It is to me, too.

1078
00:57:55,815 --> 00:57:58,850
- Really?
- Yeah.

1079
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,153
I just said those things.

1080
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:03,988
You'll stay in New York?

1081
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:05,857
No.

1082
00:58:05,908 --> 00:58:08,243
I'm going to interview
for the job in DC.

1083
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,911
You know why?

1084
00:58:11,664 --> 00:58:14,282
I'll take the last plane every
Friday night after the show

1085
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:15,867
and then the first plane
back on Mondays.

1086
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:18,203
Or sometimes I could
come to New York.

1087
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,871
Or meet in the middle
of New Jersey.

1088
00:58:19,922 --> 00:58:21,756
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1089
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:25,176
Have you had a lot of
long-distance relationships?

1090
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,595
- Yes.
- Have any of them worked?

1091
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,681
No.

1092
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,216
Then why is this
going to be different?

1093
00:58:31,267 --> 00:58:33,184
I wasn't in love with them.

1094
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:36,304
Wait, what?

1095
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:48,566
You turned down <i>News Night</i>?

1096
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:50,285
Yeah.

1097
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:53,321
I figured why do a broadcast
with 1.1 million viewers

1098
00:58:53,372 --> 00:58:56,741
when I can do one for 287,000 and
make less money at the same time?

1099
00:58:56,743 --> 00:58:59,077
- Yeah, why do you do that?
- It's getting better.

1100
00:58:59,128 --> 00:59:00,412
It's getting good.

1101
00:59:00,414 --> 00:59:01,663
It's been good for a long time.

1102
00:59:01,714 --> 00:59:04,699
Next quarter it'll be 288,000.
You'll see.

1103
00:59:04,733 --> 00:59:06,217
So we're all landing
on our feet.

1104
00:59:06,252 --> 00:59:08,136
Mm-hmm.

1105
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,421
Except for you killing Charlie.

1106
00:59:09,472 --> 00:59:11,089
Don't even...
That's not funny.

1107
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:15,343
Doesn't it bother anyone
that after the life he led,

1108
00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:17,645
he literally died fighting for
something he didn't believe in?

1109
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,681
When Pruit tried
to fire you and Mac,

1110
00:59:19,732 --> 00:59:21,816
we saw what Charlie
believed in in a hurry.

1111
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:25,987
I just miss him.

1112
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:30,108
Hey.

1113
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,778
Nancy gave me something
she wanted you to have.

1114
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:35,530
- What is it?
- I don't know.

1115
00:59:49,678 --> 00:59:52,180
Okay, I need a list of all the
routes to the closest hospitals.

1116
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,549
- Why?
- Safety counts.

1117
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,967
Someone could hit their head.

1118
00:59:56,018 --> 00:59:59,437
I want a list of the 10
best OB-GYNs in the world.

1119
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:01,139
Why is that?

1120
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,141
'Cause if a woman hits her head,
I think she'd feel more comfortable...

1121
01:00:03,192 --> 01:00:05,527
- That's not the way it works.
- We'll do more later.

1122
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:07,028
I'm gonna need
some answers to questions

1123
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,064
like why does water come out of a faucet,
but I'll make a list.

1124
01:00:10,115 --> 01:00:11,649
Congratulations.

1125
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,402
- You told her I was pregnant?
- You're pregnant?

1126
01:00:14,453 --> 01:00:16,821
She was congratulating
you on the job.

1127
01:00:16,823 --> 01:00:18,740
- Damn it.
- Please don't mention it to anyone.

1128
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:21,493
- Everyone knows.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1129
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:26,247
It was the Kwench story
and the models at the party.

1130
01:00:26,298 --> 01:00:29,133
Leona convinced him to give a
woman a high-level promotion.

1131
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:31,636
Yeah, that's probably right,
but who cares?

1132
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,088
What does it matter how you got the job?
You have the job.

1133
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:37,175
You're gonna get to do the job.
That's a really big deal.

1134
01:00:37,226 --> 01:00:39,844
It's gonna be harder than it was
for Charlie with Reese and Leona.

1135
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:42,730
It's gonna be a fight with Pruit
every day and over big things.

1136
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:44,682
I have faith.

1137
01:00:44,733 --> 01:00:46,317
Why?

1138
01:00:51,824 --> 01:00:53,608
There's a hole
in the side of the boat.

1139
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:56,160
That hole is never
going to be fixed

1140
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:59,280
and it's never going away
and you can't get a new boat.

1141
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:02,534
This is your boat.
What you have to do

1142
01:01:02,536 --> 01:01:05,753
is bail water out
faster than it's coming in.

1143
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,675
Also, I have to not die.
That's crucial.

1144
01:01:12,094 --> 01:01:14,212
It's always gonna be something
with you, isn't it?

1145
01:01:16,765 --> 01:01:18,383
<i>You know what, kiddo?</i>

1146
01:01:18,434 --> 01:01:20,768
In the old days
of about 10 minutes ago,

1147
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:22,637
we did the news well.

1148
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:26,307
You know how?
We just decided to.

1149
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:31,696
<i>60 seconds.</i>

1150
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:44,325
<i>Stand by, camera one.</i>

1151
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,248
- We've got Julie online.
- The shot's clean.

1152
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,417
Tape, cue the VO
on A-2 before sound.

1153
01:01:52,419 --> 01:01:56,588
- No, I'm saying it wasn't.
- It wasn't verifiable.

1154
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,814
I appreciate that.

1155
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,100
Don.

1156
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,435
Mandela's been put
on life support.

1157
01:02:10,486 --> 01:02:12,654
- Can you put together your notes for me?
- Yeah.

1158
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:23,147
Military court of appeals ruled
that he was improperly denied

1159
01:02:23,182 --> 01:02:24,782
a lawyer when he was
initially questioned.

1160
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:27,285
That's what I was looking for.

1161
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,628
You know what?
Can we check this number in G4-A?

1162
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:38,429
I think it's supposed
to be 14 million.

1163
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:41,049
14,000 would be ridiculous.

1164
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,635
Hey, it's Jim in New York.
Can you hear me?

1165
01:02:43,686 --> 01:02:47,138
All right, he wants to ask you about
the mood of the leadership, but...

1166
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:49,557
- Mac, they're already walking it back...
- Low interest rates.

1167
01:02:49,608 --> 01:02:51,059
It's a big part of the story.

1168
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,694
What are you
gonna ask me about?

1169
01:02:52,728 --> 01:02:54,529
- Low interest rates.
- What?

1170
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,698
- Low interest rates.
- Do you want a card?

1171
01:02:56,732 --> 01:02:58,316
It can be in a special color.

1172
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:00,118
<i>The court said that the...</i>

1173
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:02,120
<i>That the supporters of Prop 8</i>

1174
01:03:02,154 --> 01:03:04,656
<i>had no standing to challenge
the lower court.</i>

1175
01:03:04,658 --> 01:03:06,824
"Has no standing"
is how it reads in the ruling.

1176
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:08,209
That's a legal distinction.

1177
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,461
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna look
at it again in the break.</i>

1178
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:11,879
10 seconds.

1179
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:14,999
- Just those three...
- New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania.

1180
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,418
- Good show, everybody.
- Yeah, hang on a second.

1181
01:03:17,469 --> 01:03:20,505
In three, two, roll in.
