00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:28,490
<i>- Unbelievable.</i>
<i>- Unbelievable.</i>

4
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:31,060
That is a subpoena for a reporter
to appear before a grand jury.

5
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:33,328
If they had grand juries in East Germany
and East Germany still existed,

6
00:01:33,363 --> 00:01:34,730
then that's where
we'd be right now.

7
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:36,281
Put it away, Rebecca.

8
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:38,400
And nobody says a word about
this to anyone tonight.

9
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:41,286
<i>- What happens now?</i>
- Monday morning, he'll appear before a grand jury.

10
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:43,872
He'll be asked to name
his source and he'll say...

11
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,908
- No problem.
- He'll refuse.

12
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,743
Tuesday morning,
the prosecutor...

13
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:49,411
Who wants Will's head
hung in his den.

14
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:52,664
...will go to a judge to get an order
for Will to answer the question.

15
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:54,466
Wednesday morning,
armed with the order,

16
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:57,386
the prosecutor will ask him
again and he'll refuse again.

17
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,172
Thursday morning,
we appear before the same judge,

18
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:02,007
who the prosecutor will
inform that Will has refused

19
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:03,642
to comply with
a court order and then...

20
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:06,562
- Everybody goes home.
- Because you're too big to jail?

21
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:08,931
- That's right.
- Will, you've been wrong about everything.

22
00:02:08,982 --> 00:02:11,400
- Every step of the way.
- Do you really think this administration is going

23
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:13,268
- to lock up a reporter...
- I didn't think they'd raid a newsroom and that happened.

24
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,320
...who exposed a disinformation
campaign that resulted...

25
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,823
I didn't think Neal would have to flee extradition,
and Neal's in Venezuela.

26
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:19,942
And I didn't think they'd have
the sack to subpoena you,

27
00:02:19,944 --> 00:02:23,112
but you've just been served
by a kid in a rented tuxedo.

28
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:24,830
And the reason the kid
was wearing a tuxedo

29
00:02:24,864 --> 00:02:26,748
was because they don't
want to make any noise.

30
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:30,752
Or maybe they sent out
a press release.

31
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,871
No shit.

32
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:35,124
- You know what this is gonna be?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:36,792
"Will McAvoy,
hypocrite in a monkey suit."

34
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:39,011
It's been posted on Carnivore,
but it's been picked up by everybody.

35
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:40,712
Carnivore?
It was posted on Carnivore?

36
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:42,014
Also,
what the hell is Carnivore?

37
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,850
It's a new website that
just got its first scoop.

38
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:48,604
"ACN won't be attending the Saturnalia
of incestuous ingratiation..."

39
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:50,722
- I remember that.
- "That does little to instill confidence

40
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:54,143
in the public that the press isn't
ensorcelled by the powerful."

41
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:56,862
- I have to go find someone. Don.
- Hmm?

42
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,397
Lead the team
on the Kundu story

43
00:02:58,448 --> 00:03:00,482
which has to be on the air
by Wednesday night.

44
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:02,534
That's in four... Why does it have to
be on the air by Wednesday night?

45
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:04,319
Because it does.

46
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:07,039
- You and I need to talk.
- Yeah. Not here.

47
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:12,578
Will,
I'm Mimi Tassler with BuzzFeed.

48
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,463
- Nice to meet you.
- Any comment on the story in Carnivore?

49
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:15,964
I was wrong about
the Correspondents' Dinner.

50
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,333
I forgot what a great
time I always have.

51
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:20,169
Will,
I'm Zachary Webber with Politico.

52
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,837
Do you want to comment
on the story?

53
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,589
Sure.
I probably need to read it first.

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,507
- I'm going back to the hotel.
- You can't.

55
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:27,342
- No, I can't stay here.
- Think for a second.

56
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:29,094
- What's the reason we came here in...
- Pruit.

57
00:03:29,145 --> 00:03:30,679
We have to sit with Pruit.

58
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:33,148
I've had a minute with him
and so far it's going badly.

59
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:34,816
You don't think he's going
to buy the network?

60
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:37,269
No, I think he is.

61
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,022
- I've never heard of Carnivore.
- It's new.

62
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:41,523
Why do they have
names like that?

63
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,026
Carnivore, Vulture,
Beast, Gawker.

64
00:03:44,077 --> 00:03:45,861
I don't know.

65
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:48,447
And why do gossip columnists always
sound like gossip columnists?

66
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:51,867
Finke, Weasel, Snitch, Frump.

67
00:03:51,918 --> 00:03:53,535
I'm not familiar

68
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:55,871
with Snitch, Weasel, and Frump.
What do you read?

69
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:57,623
Well,
I read Jonathan Weasel on a regular basis

70
00:03:57,674 --> 00:03:59,458
before clicking over
to AngrySpiders.com.

71
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:02,211
- Anyway, my answer to your question...
- Hey!

72
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:04,062
You'll tell me later.

73
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:06,548
- We were thinking about calling it a night.
- It's early.

74
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,184
Don and I were just given
a new deadline on a story.

75
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,186
- What's the deadline?
- Wednesday night.

76
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:13,472
- Gonna rent a car and drive back to New York tonight.
<i>- I'll go with you.</i>

77
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,941
Maggie and I were just
discussing an ethical dilemma.

78
00:04:15,975 --> 00:04:18,227
She has a friend
who's dating a woman

79
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:20,729
who just started writing for
a website called Carnivore.

80
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,898
- We should go.
- I just want to hear what they think.

81
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,901
Maggie's friend thinks that
websites like this are toxic

82
00:04:25,903 --> 00:04:27,903
<i>and are poisoning our national
conversation and culture,</i>

83
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:29,488
<i>but he likes the girl.</i>

84
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:32,908
So my question is,
would he date a drug dealer?

85
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:39,081
How would you like
to handle this?

86
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,666
- Wait.
- Yeah.

87
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,584
- <i>She works for Carnivore.</i>
<i>- Of course she works for Carnivore.</i>

88
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:45,087
I just said you'll tell me
later as I waved them over.

89
00:04:45,138 --> 00:04:47,139
How could you not
pick up on that cue?

90
00:04:47,173 --> 00:04:49,591
- I've never been good at that.
- You're terrible at that.

91
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:53,645
Yeah, so we're gonna go get that
car and pick you up at the hotel.

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,847
Cool. I...

93
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:59,735
- Listen.
- Not yet.

94
00:05:04,073 --> 00:05:06,658
- Drug dealer?
- He said that. I didn't say that.

95
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:08,110
You're talking
about this with Maggie?

96
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:10,028
- It came up at work.
- What came up?

97
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,197
It just...

98
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:13,615
Your new job.

99
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:15,534
Your disapproval of me
came up at work?

100
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:17,369
The page view incentives
in your contract.

101
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,288
They're bonuses,
you judgmental prick.

102
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,789
And why don't you
believe in me?

103
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,708
Why do you assume that as soon
as I take a job like this,

104
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,960
- I'm gonna be an asshole?
- I don't think that you're...

105
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:27,546
Yes, you do.
Why?

106
00:05:29,549 --> 00:05:31,350
How did Carnivore
get that story about Will?

107
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:33,518
- Did you see my byline on it?
- No.

108
00:05:33,553 --> 00:05:36,805
No. 2,000 reporters and he thought
he was going to get away with it?

109
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:38,440
He didn't knock over a bank.

110
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:41,360
He sang an aria about how messed
up the Correspondents' Dinner was,

111
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,312
said ACN wasn't going
and then showed up.

112
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:46,448
You weren't aware of the aria
until I told you about it.

113
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:49,484
That story was waiting and ready to
go and I'm the one who leaked it.

114
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:50,819
It wasn't going to be a secret.

115
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:52,988
You had nothing to do with it?

116
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:57,876
I told them what to look for.

117
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:02,164
- Yeah.
- If I hadn't, I would be betraying my job,

118
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,665
and you know that.

119
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:06,752
You know that.
It's horrible that I got it from you, but...

120
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:10,005
Listen, the new HR guy at AWM,
Wyatt Earp...

121
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:12,090
- Not his name.
- Wyatt Geary.

122
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,976
He's onto us, me and Sloan,
and he wants me bad.

123
00:06:15,011 --> 00:06:17,729
He's gonna come asking questions,
and when he does, you say...

124
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:19,598
Don and Sloan
are just colleagues.

125
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:21,600
Should you guys be standing
next to each other?

126
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,101
Yeah,
what are you doing standing next to me?

127
00:06:23,152 --> 00:06:24,936
I really don't know.

128
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:27,356
Scatter.

129
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:34,946
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:34,997 --> 00:06:37,499
I'm sorry, too.

131
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:40,252
- I get it.
- Do you?

132
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,958
- Where have you been?
- Looking for someone.

133
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,677
We're supposed
to be talking to Pruit.

134
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:51,380
Listen, a little while ago...

135
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:53,849
- Nothing.
- You sure?

136
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:55,851
Yeah.
Let's talk to Pruit.

137
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:08,563
Lucas.

138
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:11,566
Books are like the new art,
don't you think?

139
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:14,569
Yes. No.
I have no idea what you mean.

140
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,405
We don't need them anymore,
but they look nice.

141
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:18,657
- We don't need books?
- Not on paper.

142
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:21,960
I'll send you a Kindle, Grandpa Joe.
You'll like it.

143
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:24,379
- I'm Will McAvoy.
- MacKenzie McHale.

144
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:26,331
If you say you're not
gonna come to a party

145
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,633
and you say it loud
to a million people,

146
00:07:28,668 --> 00:07:31,586
you can't show up to the party.

147
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:34,639
He came to talk to you because you said
you wanted to meet him at the party.

148
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:37,476
Why did you want
to meet him at the party?

149
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,761
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Take it easy.

150
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:42,481
<i>I won't take it easy.
The position you put him in,</i>

151
00:07:42,515 --> 00:07:43,932
all of us, for a laugh?

152
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:46,735
It was not for a laugh.
Don't be a child.

153
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,737
It was an exercise of power.

154
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:50,772
You shoved the Lansings
around for years

155
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:53,775
and I wanted to let you know right off the
bat that I'm not impressed by ratings.

156
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:57,662
Second, I want you to know that
I'm not in this for the trophy.

157
00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:00,031
I'm in it for the ratings.
I'm just kidding.

158
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:02,451
But really,
second place does nothing for me.

159
00:08:02,502 --> 00:08:04,669
Good, 'cause as of last week,
we're in fourth.

160
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:06,788
I don't know how you
managed to swing that.

161
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,790
I was very proud
of our Boston coverage.

162
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,626
Proud is generally what people
pretend they are when they've lost.

163
00:08:11,628 --> 00:08:13,128
Cryptic is generally
what people are

164
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,047
when they're trying to pretend
they possess supernatural powers.

165
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:18,350
Okay,
we've gotten off to a rough start.

166
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:21,136
Lucas, we're naturally curious
about your plans for the network.

167
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:23,472
What if I told you you could
be the number one news network

168
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:25,056
and change the world
at the same time?

169
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:26,975
Change it into what?

170
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:29,644
A place where people say snappy,
sardonic things like that.

171
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:32,647
Hey, we really have to do better at
talking to each other right now.

172
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:34,483
- Who are you looking for?
- Me?

173
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:36,284
<i>You've glanced around
a couple of times.</i>

174
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,620
- Nothing, I'm here.
- Is that accent real?

175
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:39,955
Can we please cut the shit?

176
00:08:39,989 --> 00:08:41,740
<i>I'm gonna infuse ACN
with tens of millions</i>

177
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,792
of new dollars in your budget.
How does that sound?

178
00:08:43,826 --> 00:08:45,994
I'm gonna get 18 to
25-year-olds to watch the news

179
00:08:46,045 --> 00:08:48,747
so it can support itself and
so it doesn't die when you do.

180
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:50,499
The news gathering
and newscasts

181
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,334
will have tentacles in every
reach of the Internet.

182
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:55,470
Interactives, podcasts, live streams,
Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter.

183
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:56,888
We'll make our audience
reporters in the field

184
00:08:56,923 --> 00:08:59,508
through Instagram and Vine, Snapchat and blogs.
You still with me?

185
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,142
Our users become the audience

186
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:03,144
and our audience
becomes contributors.

187
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:04,479
That's my plan.

188
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:07,516
Needless to say,
I'm impressed by your indifference

189
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:09,935
to talent, experience,
and credentials.

190
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:13,021
And I assume the absence of the words truth,
trust,

191
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:17,192
and professionalism in your mission
statement was an oversight.

192
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:20,695
<i>Your contempt for the second-rate
seems to be a contradiction, too,</i>

193
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:23,031
since you believe
the best reporting

194
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:25,033
is done by anyone with a phone

195
00:09:25,035 --> 00:09:27,285
and the time it takes to write
"epic fail."

196
00:09:27,336 --> 00:09:30,071
<i>And as an old guy,
I've got a lot more respect</i>

197
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,374
for 18 to 25-year-olds
than you do

198
00:09:32,425 --> 00:09:35,427
'cause I don't believe
their heads will explode

199
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,263
if you stop patronizing them
for an hour a night

200
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:40,682
and tell them what the fuck's
going on in their lives

201
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:43,385
and maybe even in the lives
of other people.

202
00:09:43,387 --> 00:09:46,221
The air up on that pedestal
must be pretty thin,

203
00:09:46,223 --> 00:09:47,889
'cause you are delusional, sir.

204
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:51,560
If I am,
I plan on staying that way.

205
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:53,728
And my network's staying, too.

206
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,314
We've got a problem now,
you and me.

207
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:58,400
Have a good evening.

208
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:06,372
_

209
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:12,581
You knew that the
documents were stolen by the source?

210
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:14,666
- Yes, sir.
- You knew the documents were classified?

211
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:17,586
- Yes, sir.
- Did Mr. Sampat tell you anything about the source?

212
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:20,055
- Yes, sir.
- Did Mr. Sampat tell you his name?

213
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:22,090
- Yes, sir.
- Will you tell us the name of your source?

214
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:25,393
- No, sir.
- Let me phrase that differently.

215
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:27,495
Would you tell the grand jury
the name of the person

216
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,432
you know to have stolen
classified government documents

217
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:32,734
<i>containing secrets,
which if made public,</i>

218
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:35,520
<i>could calamitously threaten
our national security?</i>

219
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:37,572
No, sir, I won't.

220
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:40,992
At this time I'll excuse the grand
jury until 10:00 AM Wednesday,

221
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:43,612
at which time I will return
with a court order

222
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:45,780
compelling the witness
to answer that question.

223
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:47,332
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

224
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:49,451
And, Mr. McAvoy,
you can step down.

225
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,134
Hey.

226
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:08,303
Does anybody know if they got
that guy out of the country?

227
00:11:08,354 --> 00:11:10,939
The writer.
The guy who wrote the fake story.

228
00:11:10,973 --> 00:11:13,141
Been over a week since the
government's known about the breach.

229
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:14,359
They would have pulled him,
right?

230
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,195
You would think so,
but we need to find out.

231
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:21,032
Oh, come on!

232
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,817
Come on in.

233
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:24,853
Don't look at any of these papers,
don't look down,

234
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:27,072
- and don't ask anyone what they're doing.
- Got it.

235
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:28,657
I just wanted
to ask you in person

236
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:31,826
why you haven't accepted my
friend request on Instagram.

237
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,131
It was the very next thing
I was gonna do.

238
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:38,216
- How about now?
- Sure.

239
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,418
Gary, toss me my phone.

240
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:42,504
Martin, can you read this over,

241
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:44,506
and if it looks good to you,
take it to Mac?

242
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:46,341
Sure.

243
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:51,346
- Accepted.
- Awesome.

244
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:56,851
Come in.

245
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:59,020
It's from Don and it says
"Take to Sloan"

246
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:00,555
and then it says
"Sabbith" in quotes.

247
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,574
I was told to read it.
Do you think it meant take to Sloan Sabbith...

248
00:12:02,608 --> 00:12:03,908
Was the new HR guy
just down there?

249
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:06,361
- Yeah, how did you know?
- It's his Instagram password.

250
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,501
Nice try, but my mama didn't raise a
fool unless you count my brothers.

251
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,954
So I don't know what we just did,
but I'm gonna go back to work.

252
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,539
- Yeah.
- Hey.

253
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,957
Have you been outside today?

254
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:20,875
How do you think I got from
where I live to where I work?

255
00:12:20,926 --> 00:12:22,544
- I just mean it's a gorgeous day.
- Shut up.

256
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:23,878
All right.

257
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:26,848
There has to be another way.

258
00:12:26,882 --> 00:12:30,118
There has to be another buyer
for this network in the next...

259
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:32,554
- Few hours?
- Few days.

260
00:12:35,858 --> 00:12:38,359
Elon Musk, Larry Ellison,
Antoinette Dodd,

261
00:12:38,394 --> 00:12:40,195
Michael...
Michael Bloomberg?

262
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:41,980
- Do you know any of those people?
<i>- I know all of them.</i>

263
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:43,698
But Leona and Reese
told you they exhausted

264
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,233
all their options
before they went to Pruit.

265
00:12:45,235 --> 00:12:47,869
They exhausted all their options
for keeping control of AWM

266
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:50,371
before selling us,
but they didn't necessarily

267
00:12:50,406 --> 00:12:52,540
exhaust their options
of who to sell us to.

268
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:54,709
Look, I want what you want,

269
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:57,162
but this is big business
and you're a news director.

270
00:12:57,213 --> 00:12:58,496
<i>You don't know
what you're doing.</i>

271
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:00,048
You can't just write down
names of rich people.

272
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:02,050
<i>I didn't just write down...
Those are all people</i>

273
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:04,252
<i>who would be interested
in media buys.</i>

274
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:05,837
Elon Musk isn't interested.

275
00:13:05,888 --> 00:13:08,006
Michael Bloomberg
has his own media company.

276
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:10,475
Larry Ellison is busy
winning the America's Cup.

277
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:12,644
Toni Dodd...

278
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,731
- Antoinette Dodd.
- What?

279
00:13:16,766 --> 00:13:19,184
- This is unbelievable.
- What?

280
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:20,685
It's just...
So help me Hannah...

281
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:22,437
I read in Page Six,
like, two weeks ago

282
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:23,905
that Toni Dodd was looking
to buy a media group.

283
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:26,107
<i>I remember because I thought,</i>

284
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:28,610
"This is exactly what happens to
Melanie Griffith in <i>Working Girl</i>."

285
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:31,446
And, hand to God,
I was on the Staten Island Ferry at the time.

286
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:33,531
<i>But there was nothing I could
do with that information,</i>

287
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,618
so my mind went to how good a young
Alec Baldwin was in the movie.

288
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,003
And whatever happened
to that Carly Simon song?

289
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,122
You think Toni Dodd wants
to buy a news network?

290
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:43,708
Page Six wouldn't say it
unless it was true.

291
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,127
And she has in the area
of $4 billion?

292
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:48,713
That's not how it works.
Nobody has $4 billion.

293
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:50,465
But, yes, she has $4 billion.

294
00:13:50,516 --> 00:13:53,468
- Are you able to call her? She'll take your call?
- Yeah.

295
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,138
You need to set up a meeting for her
and Leona as soon as humanly possible.

296
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,941
Leona can't meet with another buyer
while she's negotiating with Pruit.

297
00:13:59,975 --> 00:14:02,777
Friendly, informal,
off-the-record meeting.

298
00:14:02,812 --> 00:14:06,114
- Pruit will go away.
- Not fast or far enough.

299
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:07,482
I know you don't like the guy,
but...

300
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:09,150
It doesn't matter
that I don't like him.

301
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:10,869
It matters
that I'm scared of him.

302
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:12,620
You were scared
of Reese and Leona,

303
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,189
but you turned them around.

304
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:16,457
You'll fight with Pruit
and you'll win.

305
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:19,127
I don't want to fight with anybody, Sloan.
I'm tired.

306
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:21,129
I don't want to expand
the definition of the news.

307
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:22,497
I want to narrow it.

308
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:25,416
We'll be right back at the beginning,
only worse.

309
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,635
I can't fight these fights
with this guy.

310
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,888
I won't win.

311
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:31,840
We can meet with her.

312
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:35,310
- You and me?
- Yeah.

313
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:36,978
But quietly.

314
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:38,930
'Cause there's one option
worse than Pruit,

315
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:42,517
and that's this place getting sold for
parts and a lot of people out of work.

316
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,602
Very quietly.

317
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:46,688
And now.

318
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,492
- How'd it go?
- Exactly the way we said it would.

319
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:53,077
Now Lasenthal goes to a judge

320
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:55,113
to get court to compel Will
to answer the question.

321
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:57,782
Now,
tell me what's happening in here.

322
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,500
Tell me we'll be able to run
the story by Wednesday night.

323
00:14:59,535 --> 00:15:01,169
We've got the motive,
but we don't have the ringleader.

324
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:02,670
The motive is what
we thought it was?

325
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:04,839
To disrupt and delay their elections.
We've got that cold.

326
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:07,125
Elections that would have yielded
a hard-line Islamic government.

327
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:08,710
Democracy is good as long
as we like the outcome.

328
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,879
<i>- Yes.</i>
- How do you circle that square?

329
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,881
By knowing that Islam is a religion
and not a form of government.

330
00:15:12,883 --> 00:15:15,550
- When it becomes one, it is fascism.
- And the 38 dead bodies?

331
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:18,019
Are a bargain compared to what
it'll cost us in blood and money

332
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:19,888
when we have to bomb the
place five years from now

333
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:21,306
<i>because it's al-Qaeda's
new home office.</i>

334
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:23,474
But we've got
a different problem.

335
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:25,727
The writer of the story,
we think he's still on the ground.

336
00:15:25,729 --> 00:15:27,896
Don and I are each talking to
a different source at State.

337
00:15:27,898 --> 00:15:30,481
When I asked my source if the writer was out,
he said, "I don't know. Is he?"

338
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,367
They're trying
to slow down the story.

339
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:33,902
Then my guy said,
"No, the writer is not out."

340
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:36,404
- Do you believe him?
- 50-50.

341
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:39,240
But when our story comes out that
this guy worked with the US,

342
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,159
they're gonna slit the throats of
his children right in front of him

343
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,877
<i>and then drag them
down Main Street,</i>

344
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:45,246
so I don't want to pick
the wrong 50.

345
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:48,249
- <i>Extend your arbitrary deadline.</i>
- It's not arbitrary.

346
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,085
Work with State,
get the guy and his family out today.

347
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:54,672
- It's night in Kundu.
- The phones don't work at our embassy at night?

348
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:06,017
- What are you working on?
- A piece.

349
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:11,823
You're not allowed to tell me?

350
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:13,858
I don't want
to fight right now.

351
00:16:15,444 --> 00:16:17,662
I don't either.

352
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:19,364
I'm really glad you said that.

353
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:22,333
Do you mean that?

354
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:26,838
I have to go back
to the office tonight.

355
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,125
We're crashing on a deadline
I don't even understand.

356
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:34,212
I just want to eat my sandwich
near you for a while.

357
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:37,966
Sometimes you say that
and then you ambush me.

358
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:41,219
What are you working on?

359
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,638
My editor wants me
to write more personally.

360
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:45,606
- Like an op-ed?
- Yeah.

361
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:48,059
- What's wrong with op-eds?
- Nothing.

362
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,144
What are you writing about?

363
00:16:50,195 --> 00:16:52,146
I pitched a few,
but the only one they liked

364
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:54,532
was my experience
with the Plan B pill.

365
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:58,653
Cool.

366
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:03,741
- Come on.
- I said cool.

367
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:06,327
You said more than that.
What's wrong with writing in the first person?

368
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:08,496
What's wrong with sex?
And what's wrong with my new job?

369
00:17:08,547 --> 00:17:11,332
Hallie, I said cool.

370
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,501
You're not going to give me
a hard time about this?

371
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:17,922
I'm your boyfriend.
It is my role to support you.

372
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:21,342
It's a role I'm grateful to
have and I want to do it well.

373
00:17:23,095 --> 00:17:24,846
Thank you.

374
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:27,265
- Sorry I jumped the gun.
- No problem.

375
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:41,412
Does your piece begin,
"Dear <i>Penthouse</i>,

376
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:44,499
- I've never written a letter like this before"?
- Motherfucker!

377
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,745
_

378
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,304
You know how this is gonna end,
right?

379
00:18:06,355 --> 00:18:08,523
Please don't directly
address my client.

380
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:10,108
We're in chambers, Counselor.

381
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,559
I don't care if we're
in your fucking hot tub.

382
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:14,278
Hey, I'm on a government salary.
I barely have a bathtub.

383
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:15,780
Good morning.

384
00:18:15,814 --> 00:18:17,982
- Morning, Judge.
- Good morning, sir.

385
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,902
Does anybody need
any coffee or anything?

386
00:18:20,953 --> 00:18:22,620
- No, thank you, Judge.
- No, thank you.

387
00:18:22,654 --> 00:18:25,406
Mr. Lasenthal,
how can a man with your resume

388
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,741
possibly let this happen?

389
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:29,327
Your Honor,
there's a limit to my ability

390
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:31,245
<i>to let or not let
things happen.</i>

391
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:33,414
Not much of a limit.

392
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,250
Mr. McAvoy is aware
of the identity of someone

393
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:39,337
who has committed in excess
of 27,000 counts of theft

394
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:42,840
<i>of government property,
disclosure of classified documents,</i>

395
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:45,593
and conspiracy
to commit espionage.

396
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:47,845
The suspect remains
at large and presents

397
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:50,481
a clear and present danger
to national security.

398
00:18:50,516 --> 00:18:53,317
<i>Why is he not protected
by the First Amendment?</i>

399
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:55,770
<i>Because the court in
Branzburg denied the press</i>

400
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:57,655
First Amendment protection
when they're subpoenaed

401
00:18:57,689 --> 00:19:00,108
to testify before a grand
jury in a criminal case.

402
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:01,859
Counsel?

403
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,277
Sir,
the court in Branzburg also said

404
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:06,030
that a journalist need not comply
with a grand jury subpoena

405
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:08,116
where there's bad faith
or harassment.

406
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:11,035
The government has raided
my client's newsroom,

407
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,371
seized hard drives,
and threatened him

408
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:15,506
with criminal prosecution
under the Espionage Act.

409
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:18,126
In this case,
a journalist participated in the crime.

410
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:21,045
He didn't pull on a ski mask, Judge.

411
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,764
- He may have unwittingly...
- He didn't do anything unwittingly.

412
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,349
<i>He is the senior
editor of ACN Digital.</i>

413
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:27,185
<i>You are speculating
on whether a third party...</i>

414
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:28,553
All right, all right.

415
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:30,972
Mr. McAvoy,
is there anything you'd like to say?

416
00:19:30,974 --> 00:19:33,808
I haven't heard a request from the prosecutor,
sir.

417
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:36,944
Am I crazy,
or have you argued in my court?

418
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:40,064
You're not crazy, sir.
Brooklyn Criminal Court, Part C.

419
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:43,484
- How'd I do?
- You were very fair.

420
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:46,020
Does Your Honor need
to recuse himself?

421
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,039
I want counsel
to take care of this.

422
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:51,542
I don't want to see the press on the
steps when I come in to work tomorrow.

423
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:55,496
And I absolutely don't want to see
you in my courtroom on Thursday,

424
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:58,216
which I strongly suspect
is what's going to happen

425
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,801
as Mr. McAvoy
does not strike me

426
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:03,171
as someone
who is likely to cave,

427
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:05,223
especially with
everybody watching.

428
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:07,508
It was foolish of you,
Mr. Lasenthal.

429
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,977
The DOJ should not
have let it go this far.

430
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:13,014
The Department of Justice, Your Honor,
is not playing a strategic game.

431
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:16,317
We have to arrest his source and the
government of the United States

432
00:20:16,351 --> 00:20:19,270
will avail itself of every
legal measure to do that.

433
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:21,522
The government's request
is granted.

434
00:20:21,573 --> 00:20:24,192
Mr. McAvoy,
you're directed to appear

435
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:27,161
before the grand jury
at 10:00 AM tomorrow.

436
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:31,199
- I have a logic problem.
- Maggie, what's going on over there?

437
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:34,452
<i>- His logic is inconsistent.</i>
- How?

438
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:36,871
He doesn't believe the source should
have leaked classified documents.

439
00:20:36,922 --> 00:20:39,924
- Neither do I.
- But he's unwilling to help law enforcement

440
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,509
capture the source
by identifying him.

441
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:43,594
He can't.
I'd be unwilling and so would you.

442
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:45,429
I know,
but following that logic,

443
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:47,465
he should also not be willing
to broadcast the story.

444
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:49,934
If he believes no one should
ever leak because it poses

445
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:52,386
a critical threat,
then why is he broadcasting the story?

446
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:54,105
Well, I can't speak for Will,
but I will.

447
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:56,190
This leak, he believes,
is a good leak.

448
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:58,226
What he's very reasonably
worried about is the bad leaks.

449
00:20:58,228 --> 00:20:59,443
So he'd prefer
there are no leaks.

450
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:01,062
You and Will are making
the same unilateral decision

451
00:21:01,113 --> 00:21:02,396
you don't want
a leaker to make.

452
00:21:02,398 --> 00:21:04,482
I trust strangers
less than I trust me.

453
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,950
Your logic is consistent,
though horrifying.

454
00:21:05,984 --> 00:21:07,735
No one's gonna ever guess
you guys are a couple.

455
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:09,287
All right, listen.
Listen up.

456
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:10,871
He's refusing to leave
without his kids

457
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:13,074
- and his youngest kid doesn't have a passport.
- Jesus. All right.

458
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,742
We got to get the kid a passport.
The State has to expedite that.

459
00:21:14,744 --> 00:21:16,577
The State Department
can only issue US passports.

460
00:21:16,628 --> 00:21:18,329
- <i>They've got to walk over to the embassy...</i>
<i>- And tell them what?</i>

461
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,798
- Where are we?
- Just...

462
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:24,135
We need a favor. Whatever it is they do.
Can I talk to you a minute?

463
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,893
The youngest of his three
kids doesn't have a passport.

464
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:34,595
State's got 30 hours
to get him one.

465
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:37,265
We are talking to mid-level people
and the US Department of State

466
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:39,100
isn't hopping to it when
we give them instructions.

467
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:41,769
You have to tell me why
we have to air the story

468
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,488
tomorrow night and not a
week from tomorrow night.

469
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:55,916
All right,
I'm gonna be out for about four hours.

470
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:59,120
Once we run the story, we've shot the hostage.
Will has no more leverage.

471
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:01,922
If we don't run the story,
why don't we all just go home?

472
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:05,126
Four hours.
Don't ask me where I was when I come back.

473
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:11,299
And what we say is
important is important.

474
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,101
The news reflects back to us
our national character

475
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:18,022
and I don't like seeing a bored and
boring teenager in the mirror.

476
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:21,142
What we say is important
is important.

477
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:22,777
It's a solid business, Toni.

478
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:25,813
Locked-in carriage contracts with
every MVPD and they're staggered.

479
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:27,398
The carriage fees
are due for a hike

480
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:30,151
that could double revenues by
itself over the next decade.

481
00:22:30,153 --> 00:22:34,071
Can you talk about valuation?
Earnings before interest?

482
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:35,823
You'll look at our books and
see it's in the sweet spot

483
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:37,325
and the deal would be
accretive to your earnings.

484
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:40,127
- It would pay for itself?
- And then some.

485
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:43,664
Have you decided
what you would like?

486
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:46,217
A news network.

487
00:22:54,393 --> 00:22:57,311
You were on fire in there.

488
00:22:57,346 --> 00:23:01,048
I didn't understand half or really
any of what you were saying, but...

489
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,567
You were able to follow when she said
she's meeting with her board on Thursday

490
00:23:03,602 --> 00:23:06,437
and she thinks we'll have
an answer we'll like?

491
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:09,657
Just tell me one thing.
Is she eccentric?

492
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:12,109
- How do you mean?
- She didn't eat her food.

493
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,529
She pushed it around a little,
but she plainly doesn't like sushi.

494
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:18,416
Why set a meeting at a restaurant
where they only serve sushi?

495
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,368
Boss,
you may be overthinking that.

496
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,620
That's hardly ever the problem.

497
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:24,789
We'll find out Thursday.

498
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:32,430
It's ahead on the left.

499
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:34,932
<i>Just here.</i>

500
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:49,864
You can keep the meter running.

501
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:58,239
- No umbrella?
- You either.

502
00:23:58,241 --> 00:24:00,074
Should we sit in your car?

503
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:02,293
They may be tapping my car.

504
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:04,995
I disabled the GPS,
but they can still get in.

505
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:07,998
- We need more time.
- I told you tomorrow night.

506
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:10,384
- Lilly.
- Tomorrow night or I just have to upload the documents.

507
00:24:10,419 --> 00:24:12,336
- The writer of the story...
- We're the writer of the story.

508
00:24:12,387 --> 00:24:14,588
Joseph Bartho,
who physically wrote the story,

509
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,224
whose name is on it,
and who is paid by the US government,

510
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:21,345
is still on the ground because one of
his kids doesn't have a passport yet.

511
00:24:21,396 --> 00:24:24,932
If we run the story before
Bartho and his family are out,

512
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:28,102
the best-case scenario is he gets
a trial before he's executed.

513
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:31,021
And if you dump the documents
without them being vetted,

514
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:33,741
there's a very good chance other
people will be in danger.

515
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:35,609
You really don't need to speak
to me like I'm dim-witted.

516
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:38,779
- Please lift the deadline.
- Give me a reason to trust you.

517
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,532
You already did.
You reached out to us.

518
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,784
- Not the other way around.
- But you've been talking to the government.

519
00:24:43,835 --> 00:24:47,037
We got an invitation to talk to the government.
It's called a subpoena.

520
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:49,757
They also made an unannounced
drop-by called a raid.

521
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,959
I'm not talking about that.

522
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:54,211
You said that you've been working with
the government to vet the material.

523
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:56,096
- Of course we are.
- You trust them?

524
00:24:56,131 --> 00:24:59,767
- In my way.
- You don't trust them any more than I do.

525
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:02,269
Please lift the deadline.

526
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,306
I reached out to Neal,
not to you.

527
00:25:05,308 --> 00:25:08,726
Well,
Neal's in Venezuela, Lilly.

528
00:25:08,777 --> 00:25:10,528
And you know what?

529
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:12,396
Why aren't you?

530
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:15,282
Why haven't you said,
"This has gone too far. Let's switch places.

531
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:17,651
I'll go to a country with
no extradition treaty.

532
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:19,320
You're now free
to disclose my name.

533
00:25:19,322 --> 00:25:21,989
Neal can come home and Will
can stop spending his days

534
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,492
in front of a grand jury."
Why hasn't that happened?

535
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:26,877
You really think the price for telling
the truth should be that high?

536
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:31,916
No, I don't.

537
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:36,754
I promise the story
will be reported.

538
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:39,306
Well, I can't promise anything.

539
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:41,509
- Really?
- Look, McAvoy's a Republican.

540
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,094
- I know he thinks I'm a criminal.
- He's a journalist.

541
00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:45,429
His politics don't
have anything...

542
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,314
"Worst-period-generation-
period-ever-period."

543
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:49,183
That was spoken in the
middle of a very difficult...

544
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:51,769
I reached out to Neal,
so I can't promise anything.

545
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,575
You know,
it wouldn't matter if you did.

546
00:25:57,609 --> 00:25:59,577
I trust you less
than I trust them.

547
00:25:59,611 --> 00:26:02,947
Dump the documents
and I'll quit my job,

548
00:26:02,998 --> 00:26:06,584
walk to the FBI,
and give them your name.

549
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:08,836
- Trust that.
- Fuck you.

550
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,041
We can go back
to the airport now.

551
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:19,945
_

552
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:22,850
Mr. McAvoy,
I have here a court order directing you

553
00:26:22,884 --> 00:26:24,552
to tell us the name
of the individual

554
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:26,387
that is the target
of this investigation.

555
00:26:26,438 --> 00:26:28,806
- <i>Will you comply with the court order?</i>
- No, sir.

556
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:32,993
- <i>You won't comply with the court order?</i>
- No, sir.

557
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:39,199
I saw a lot of spirit in that shot,
a lot of guts.

558
00:26:39,234 --> 00:26:40,901
Shut it, Fast Eddie.

559
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:43,871
Why are hot women in movies
always great at pool?

560
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:46,790
Is that what men like?
A hot girl who plays nine-ball?

561
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:48,375
You could have said
anything after "hot girl"

562
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,044
- and the answer would have been...
- All right.

563
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:57,251
- Oh, brother.
- What happened?

564
00:26:57,253 --> 00:26:59,753
- <i>Hallie posted a column. You ready?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

565
00:26:59,804 --> 00:27:02,756
"Old Media Guy
and New Media Girl:

566
00:27:02,758 --> 00:27:04,308
An Analog Romance."

567
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:06,260
- What's it about?
- What do you think it's about?

568
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:08,095
- Him?
- Yeah.

569
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:11,432
It's pretty personal, but in her defense,
she doesn't use his name.

570
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:13,400
- What does she call him?
<i>- Jim?</i>

571
00:27:13,435 --> 00:27:15,853
- Yeah.
- Tim.

572
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:18,772
Hallie is
an excellent reporter.

573
00:27:18,774 --> 00:27:21,075
And she's reporting on a fight
she's having with her boyfriend.

574
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,243
- She's working a tough beat.
<i>- It's a lot more than that.</i>

575
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:24,612
Okay, read it.

576
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:26,997
"My boyfriend loves me,
but he doesn't like me.

577
00:27:27,032 --> 00:27:30,501
He definitely doesn't follow me.
He disapproves of me."

578
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:33,671
Maybe he just disapproves of using the
word "me" four times in the lead.

579
00:27:33,705 --> 00:27:35,789
How would you have
written it instead?

580
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,792
I'm not a professional writer,
but I'd have maybe tweaked the opening so it read,

581
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:40,594
"I am not making
my private life

582
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:42,630
and the private lives of others
available for entertainment

583
00:27:42,681 --> 00:27:45,265
so I can get comments like,
'You stay strong, Hallie.

584
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,801
He doesn't deserve you.'"
Seven in the corner.

585
00:27:47,803 --> 00:27:50,938
I have been a witness to Jim
being a condescending...

586
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:53,440
Look,
there's nothing wrong with this.

587
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:56,060
It's relatable and interesting
and she can write like crazy.

588
00:27:56,111 --> 00:27:58,812
Did she ask Jim's permission before
deputizing him into her well-written...

589
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:01,115
Why are you so quick
to defend Jim?

590
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:02,900
<i>Why are you so quick
to defend Hallie?</i>

591
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:05,035
Because she's going
to be attacked by Jim.

592
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,705
Probably not in print,
but I don't think that's the reason.

593
00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:10,908
I'm always grateful when a man can tell
me why I'm thinking what I'm thinking.

594
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,377
You're into Jim and you don't
want to be a jealous cliché,

595
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:15,663
so you defend Hallie for show.

596
00:28:15,665 --> 00:28:17,748
And it's a classy thing to do,

597
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,718
but at some point we're going to have
to discuss how that makes me feel

598
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:23,220
to know that any man in your life
is going to be the runner-up.

599
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:26,724
You really believe that?

600
00:28:58,206 --> 00:29:00,174
Still got my security key.

601
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:10,884
This place has gone
to hell without me.

602
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:13,053
Mm-hmm.

603
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:22,229
It's almost 1:00 in the morning,
Jim.

604
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,200
Are you not coming home
or answering my calls or texts?

605
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:33,157
I told you my editor wanted me
to write more personally.

606
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:38,579
There are classified
documents in this room.

607
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:40,631
You can't be in here.

608
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:01,018
It was an invasion of privacy.
I'm really sorry for that.

609
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:02,936
I was mad.
We had just had the last fight

610
00:30:02,938 --> 00:30:05,522
and I went into the other
room and wrote it.

611
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,574
You know my computer
doesn't trust me.

612
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:09,860
It always asks are you sure
you want to do this?

613
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:11,445
But it never asks
before I hit...

614
00:30:11,447 --> 00:30:14,615
I don't care about the invasion of privacy.
I wish I did.

615
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:18,252
I've been here for hours

616
00:30:18,286 --> 00:30:21,505
trying to make myself mad because
it was an invasion of privacy.

617
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,624
And the crowd would be on my side.
That's a no-brainer.

618
00:30:23,626 --> 00:30:27,127
- You don't like me very much.
<i>- And I wish I didn't like you so much.</i>

619
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:30,881
Took five fucking days, Hallie,

620
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:32,633
for you to give yourself
your own reality show.

621
00:30:32,635 --> 00:30:35,602
I understand your wanting
to insult me right now,

622
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:37,304
but that's not what I did.

623
00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:40,057
Writing about the media,
writing about the New York elite,

624
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:42,693
telling personal stories
that resonate with readers

625
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:45,479
doesn't take one cent
away from covering Syria

626
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,564
and Afghanistan and Washington.

627
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:49,066
There are foreign
correspondents,

628
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:50,734
sports correspondents,
fashion correspondents.

629
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:52,486
And an unbearable
correspondent.

630
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:55,405
<i>Jealous of the New York elites?
I've got you covered.</i>

631
00:30:55,456 --> 00:30:58,041
A movie star was at
an environmental fundraiser

632
00:30:58,076 --> 00:30:59,626
and they rode on a private jet?

633
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:01,378
Here's your phony outrage.

634
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:03,964
Feeling a little like
you didn't make the cut?

635
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:06,500
I hereby declare
that amateurs are awesome

636
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:09,386
and professionals
are so 20 years ago.

637
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,055
Only instead of professionals,
I'm gonna say old media,

638
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,640
and instead of Jim,
I'm gonna say Tim

639
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:16,143
because I'm Hallie Shea,
Senior Fuck You Correspondent

640
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:18,929
- <i>and I've decided to become a star.</i>
- Are you drunk?

641
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,015
Did you out yourself about the Boston tweet
to make sure no one suspected anyone else

642
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:24,067
or did you do it to let our
enemies know you were available?

643
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:25,936
Do you hear the way
you're talking right now?

644
00:31:25,987 --> 00:31:28,155
- Our enemies?
- Did you?

645
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:30,440
I'm gonna stay
at my place tonight.

646
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:33,193
Do you mind
if I tell you something?

647
00:31:33,244 --> 00:31:35,279
Your problem isn't with me
and it isn't with the site.

648
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:38,198
It's with the audience.
You don't like that they like what they like

649
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:40,250
because you need them to like
you and that's no different...

650
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:42,419
I don't give a shit
about me or liking me

651
00:31:42,453 --> 00:31:46,373
or following me or
friending me or trending.

652
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,791
It's just ugly.

653
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:49,543
I think you're threatened
by technology.

654
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:51,211
<i>I beam a signal into
outer space every night.</i>

655
00:31:51,262 --> 00:31:53,714
I'm not scared of your Samsung Galaxy.
What else you got?

656
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:56,266
I want to be part of the digital revolution.
I want to be part of...

657
00:31:56,301 --> 00:31:59,770
Oh, my God!
I am not talking about the apparatus.

658
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:04,691
Just tell me
you know I'm right.

659
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:06,443
Please. Please.

660
00:32:06,477 --> 00:32:08,362
At least tell me that.

661
00:32:08,396 --> 00:32:11,615
Tell me when you knock away the
digital revolution bullshit...

662
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:14,401
"We're not beholden
to corporate masters."

663
00:32:14,452 --> 00:32:16,286
Yeah,
or any standard of good taste.

664
00:32:16,321 --> 00:32:18,622
Tell me, please,
that you know all you did

665
00:32:18,656 --> 00:32:21,625
was have a fight with your boyfriend
and litigate it in public.

666
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,744
Because I have spent time
with hardcore drug movers

667
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:26,079
and they don't pretend
they're selling medicine.

668
00:32:37,392 --> 00:32:39,343
Yeah, I'm drunk.

669
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:24,021
- I'm gonna miss you.
- You're gonna miss a lot of things, Jim.

670
00:33:41,823 --> 00:33:45,492
- Yeah?
- If he sentences you, where do you go?

671
00:33:45,543 --> 00:33:47,828
Nowhere.
He's not gonna find me in contempt.

672
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,047
- But if he does?
- Manhattan Correctional Center.

673
00:33:50,081 --> 00:33:53,417
- That's a real jail.
- And you've been shot at and you've been stabbed.

674
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:56,636
It's 1:30.

675
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,472
I think that's your phone.

676
00:34:07,348 --> 00:34:09,850
We need a table or a dresser

677
00:34:09,852 --> 00:34:11,735
where I can put my phone.

678
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:14,021
Also walls and electricity.

679
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:15,939
Hello.

680
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,908
Is it Rebecca?
Is it Charlie?

681
00:34:17,942 --> 00:34:20,077
It wouldn't be Charlie.
It'd be Rebecca. Is it work?

682
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:22,162
It would've been my phone if it was work.
Is it Rebecca?

683
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:24,498
Hang on.

684
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:28,869
Yeah?

685
00:34:30,004 --> 00:34:31,588
Okay.

686
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:34,541
No court tomorrow.
The hearing's been moved to Friday.

687
00:34:34,592 --> 00:34:37,377
Cedarman wants Lasenthal
and Rebecca to work on a deal.

688
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:40,380
Does he know there won't be a deal
that involves not airing the story?

689
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:43,884
What he knows is he doesn't want to be
the judge who locked up a news anchor.

690
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:48,638
I find your Irish stoicism...

691
00:34:48,689 --> 00:34:50,841
- Sexy?
- Irritating.

692
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,532
_

693
00:34:54,812 --> 00:34:56,229
Thank you.

694
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,698
He's out.

695
00:35:00,785 --> 00:35:03,070
Everybody. The whole family.
Everybody's out.

696
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,238
Here we go, tonight.

697
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,707
Show me a rough sketch
to time by 3:00.

698
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:09,743
Good job, everybody.
Thank you.

699
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:12,329
We're not done yet.
Good job, Don.

700
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,831
Jim,
you look sleepier than usual.

701
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:17,584
Tess, Gary, Kendra, Martin,
Sloan, you did nothing.

702
00:35:17,635 --> 00:35:19,252
- <i>Maggie...</i>
- Mac.

703
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:20,887
Jenna,
your future is limitless.

704
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,222
Reese wants to see you
in his office.

705
00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:24,508
Now?

706
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:37,988
Reese?

707
00:35:38,022 --> 00:35:40,490
Come on in.
Close the door, please.

708
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:44,945
Joseph Bartho and the Joseph
Bartho Family Singers are out.

709
00:35:44,996 --> 00:35:46,413
We just got the word.
They're heading to France

710
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:49,366
via 14 connecting flights
and a team of oxen.

711
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,917
So we're running
the story tonight.

712
00:35:50,952 --> 00:35:54,121
You can't.
I'm sorry, you can't run it at all.

713
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:00,293
Why?

714
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:02,095
Pruit.
He signs a deal at the end of the day

715
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,047
and he won't
if we run the story.

716
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,270
Because of Will?

717
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:12,639
Says he doesn't think there's a
chance Cedarman's gonna send him.

718
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,358
It's not because of Will.
He likes that Will's going to jail.

719
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:17,394
He wants him to broadcast
from there.

720
00:36:17,445 --> 00:36:19,479
- I'm certain they won't allow that.
- I'm certain they won't, too.

721
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,398
- What's the problem, Reese?
- The fines.

722
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:23,033
His lawyers had to be told
about the story

723
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:25,569
and they've advised him that if
the story was gathered illegally,

724
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,656
the Justice Department can and probably
will impose crippling criminal fines.

725
00:36:36,964 --> 00:36:39,166
- This is horseshit.
- I know.

726
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:42,886
The source risked everything.

727
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,805
Neal's hiding in South America.

728
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,390
Will is facing a grand jury.

729
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:48,975
Bartho and his family
fled the country.

730
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,510
- And it was for nothing?
<i>- Mac.</i>

731
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:54,097
- It was for nothing?
- Yeah.

732
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:58,518
Selling the company is the only way
you get to live to fight another day.

733
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,021
Do we ever get to win one?

734
00:37:04,742 --> 00:37:06,359
I've got to go
and tell the staff.

735
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,664
Hey, Mac. You know,
the fight with the grand jury isn't over.

736
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:12,832
- They still want his source.
- I know.

737
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:15,835
Since the day you got here,
Will's been having a battle with himself.

738
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,205
Is he a real journalist
or just good on TV?

739
00:37:18,256 --> 00:37:20,924
You ever think he might
be doing this for you?

740
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:24,377
Because I don't think there's not a
chance he's gonna be sent to jail.

741
00:37:24,379 --> 00:37:26,129
I've got his ring on my finger.

742
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,765
He's not doing this
to win my approval.

743
00:37:28,799 --> 00:37:32,052
Then it would be the first thing
I've seen him do that wasn't.

744
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:40,227
I'm going to tell the staff.

745
00:37:40,229 --> 00:37:42,646
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

746
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:22,402
Can I make a suggestion which,
if you think about it, makes a lot of sense?

747
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,021
Don't say anything.

748
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,856
Have Rebecca go to Lasenthal
and say we're willing

749
00:38:26,907 --> 00:38:29,025
to kill the story in exchange
for everybody's off the hook.

750
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:32,412
Do you think there's a chance Will
would let Rebecca utter those words?

751
00:38:32,446 --> 00:38:36,866
No.

752
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:40,704
Let's pack the documents
up in cartons

753
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:42,205
and label everything.

754
00:38:42,256 --> 00:38:45,041
Yep.

755
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:48,795
Who's the most responsible
reporter you can name?

756
00:38:48,797 --> 00:38:50,680
- You.
- Thank you.

757
00:38:50,715 --> 00:38:52,966
Who doesn't work here.

758
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:55,468
Maybe someone who could
use a break.

759
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,138
Responsible how?

760
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,146
There is an old teacher
of mine from Columbia.

761
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:09,032
<i>She mostly gets garbage assignments
now 'cause she's in her 70s.</i>

762
00:39:09,066 --> 00:39:11,201
Write her name down.

763
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:21,961
I just heard.
Sorry, Bubba.

764
00:39:23,147 --> 00:39:24,998
Good afternoon.

765
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:31,638
I'll tell you, Mr. Geary,
this isn't the best time.

766
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,506
You two are a couple.

767
00:39:33,508 --> 00:39:35,141
We're not,
but maybe we can do this later.

768
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:38,094
No, you are.
I have a signed letter declaring that you are.

769
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:41,231
It was sitting in my office in a pile
of things I hadn't gotten to yet.

770
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:43,516
- Somebody ratted us out?
- Yes.

771
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:45,568
Nobody around here would drop a dime.
You're blowing smoke.

772
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:46,569
- Who cheesed?
- Okay, Mugsy.

773
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:48,104
- <i>You did.</i>
- Huh?

774
00:39:48,155 --> 00:39:50,857
- You did.
- Which one of us are you talking to?

775
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:52,826
- I think you know.
- What's he talking about?

776
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,695
Sloan wrote a letter to HR
declaring the two of you a couple.

777
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:59,199
Yeah, it was after you made $125 on the
Chipotle trade I tipped you off to.

778
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:01,868
We spent the last two weeks trying to
conceal from this man that we're dating

779
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:04,254
and the whole time you knew you'd sent
him a letter saying we were dating?

780
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:05,588
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

781
00:40:05,623 --> 00:40:07,290
Well, obviously I was
hoping he'd never find out.

782
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:08,958
But you knew he was gonna
read the letter eventually.

783
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:11,378
Eventually is a wonderful
time of day.

784
00:40:11,462 --> 00:40:13,680
This was a cross that bridge when
we get to it situation for me.

785
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:15,632
And here we are.
We're at the bridge.

786
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:18,184
- Wyatt...
- Is lying to corporate something you do habitually?

787
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:21,137
Don and I like to make decisions
about lying on a case-by-case basis.

788
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,639
Maybe you've helped enough.

789
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:25,392
Please,
don't transfer one of us.

790
00:40:25,394 --> 00:40:28,027
We don't work together enough,
but the little we do works.

791
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:30,363
And if you ask Sloan to choose
between me and her job,

792
00:40:30,398 --> 00:40:33,066
you wouldn't be able to get that
sentence out before she said her job,

793
00:40:33,068 --> 00:40:35,568
and I really like her and I'm
trying to be good enough.

794
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:37,370
And this here is the
best thing that I do.

795
00:40:37,405 --> 00:40:39,739
And can I say one more thing?
It's just occurred to me

796
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,876
that your company is only going to own
my network until the end of the day,

797
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,078
so what the hell has this
all been about?

798
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,131
- Come to think of it...
- I'm blown away you let me do it this long.

799
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,916
Why did you do it this long?

800
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,718
Fun.

801
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,670
I work in HR.

802
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:56,840
Our days aren't scored
by the "Hallelujah Chorus."

803
00:40:58,476 --> 00:41:02,011
I don't know anything about the
story you were all working on,

804
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:04,597
but I know enough to say sorry.

805
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,017
Good luck to the two of you.

806
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:10,854
I'm a big fan.

807
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:13,323
Put those Instagram
photos back.

808
00:41:13,357 --> 00:41:16,109
- Yes, sir.
- Why haven't we heard anything yet?

809
00:41:16,111 --> 00:41:18,411
- The board's still meeting.
- Pruit just walked into the building.

810
00:41:18,446 --> 00:41:20,363
- He's an hour early.
- Yeah.

811
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:22,182
What are you guys
talking about?

812
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:25,034
The Bloomberg terminal will tell
us everything we need to know.

813
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:31,090
Bloomberg terminal, tell us what's going
on with Toni Dodd's board meeting.

814
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,342
It's not a Ouija board.

815
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:34,928
I wasn't...
I was just, you know, praying.

816
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:36,379
- What are you two...
- Hang on.

817
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,798
Their press rep just tweeted,

818
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:41,434
"Exciting announcement
about major media acquisition

819
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:43,436
coming at 5:00 PM."

820
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:45,855
Go. Tell Reese.

821
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,307
So what's going on?

822
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:50,193
We found a white knight.
Antoinette Dodd's gonna buy ACN.

823
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:51,611
- Are you kidding?
- Hang on.

824
00:41:51,645 --> 00:41:53,313
- <i>No, seriously.</i>
- Hang on.

825
00:41:53,364 --> 00:41:55,899
- How did you do that?
- Shit.

826
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,784
- What?
- This can't be happening.

827
00:41:57,818 --> 00:41:59,035
I don't know what
you're looking at.

828
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:00,870
Options on Halifax
just started trading up.

829
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:04,491
- The Halifax Group.
- Halifax Group options...

830
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:06,242
Fuck!

831
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:08,044
She's buying Halifax.

832
00:42:08,078 --> 00:42:09,829
She met...
I don't believe this.

833
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,381
She met with us.
She wanted them to think...

834
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:13,466
We were leverage.

835
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:17,220
God damn it!

836
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:20,890
<i>There's no need for airports.</i>

837
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:22,809
Just runways and a fence.

838
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:24,811
That's a hell of a plan, Lucas.

839
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:28,181
Dude, I told you in college that one day I
was gonna buy a company out from under you.

840
00:42:28,232 --> 00:42:29,816
I gave you, like,
15 years' warning.

841
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,102
I remember you telling me you
were sleeping with my girlfriend,

842
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:34,687
but not the second thing.

843
00:42:34,689 --> 00:42:36,439
You were probably in shock
from the first thing.

844
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:40,527
Call it off! You don't have to
sell us to this pretentious ponce.

845
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:43,196
Toni Dodd just got out
of her board meeting

846
00:42:43,198 --> 00:42:45,365
and she's gonna make
a competitive offer.

847
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:49,202
So fuck you and fuck you again,
you fiber-optic yak.

848
00:42:49,204 --> 00:42:52,505
Charlie. Charlie.

849
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:57,427
What Sloan's telling Charlie is
that people are buying Halifax

850
00:42:57,461 --> 00:42:59,879
at the current stock price with
an expiration on the assumption

851
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,881
<i>that Toni's about to
announce she's buying it.</i>

852
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:03,633
It was leverage, Charlie.

853
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:05,768
She wanted people to think
she was looking at ACN.

854
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:07,604
That's why she had you guys
eat at that sushi place.

855
00:43:07,638 --> 00:43:09,305
She knew there was a Halifax
board member there.

856
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:11,391
- You're gonna love me, Charlie.
- No, I'm not.

857
00:43:11,393 --> 00:43:12,892
Yeah, you are.

858
00:43:12,894 --> 00:43:15,228
I'm gonna take you
into the 21st century

859
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:18,114
right after I drag you
through the 19th and 20th.

860
00:43:18,148 --> 00:43:20,700
- You couldn't have gotten here 10 seconds sooner?
- I just saw it.

861
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:23,369
- What's the point of having a Bloomberg terminal...
- It's not the terminal's fault.

862
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:24,487
<i>You want a ceremonial pen?</i>

863
00:43:24,538 --> 00:43:26,623
It can write in a zero
gravity environment.

864
00:43:26,657 --> 00:43:28,992
Yeah,
I plan to take a trip through the ionosphere.

865
00:43:29,043 --> 00:43:32,078
Keep that sense of humor.
You're very entertaining.

866
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,414
- No, whoa. Come on.
- Whoa. Whoa.

867
00:43:34,465 --> 00:43:36,332
We're sworn enemies now,
he and I.

868
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:37,884
He can still hear you.

869
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:42,722
- Did you see Charlie?
- After the show.

870
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,757
He was cleaning his
12-gauge with Maker's Mark

871
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:46,676
and muttering,
"Kill the wabbit."

872
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:53,766
It's not Irish stoicism, is it?

873
00:43:55,603 --> 00:43:59,439
This is some kind of
internal baptism for you,

874
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:03,276
which would be heartbreaking enough,
except I think maybe it's a little for me.

875
00:44:03,278 --> 00:44:06,446
Don't you know that
anything that can be proven

876
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:09,749
by courage and character,
you proved to me a long time ago?

877
00:44:09,783 --> 00:44:11,451
You want me to give up
the source?

878
00:44:11,502 --> 00:44:13,119
I just want you to say
you're scared.

879
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,921
All right, here's the thing,
MacKenzie.

880
00:44:14,955 --> 00:44:17,590
'Cause I love you,
but you've had me on your couch for three years

881
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,792
and this one time
we're switching places.

882
00:44:19,794 --> 00:44:21,711
You're tearing yourself up

883
00:44:21,762 --> 00:44:24,013
because you either prioritize
the story over me,

884
00:44:24,048 --> 00:44:25,632
which you think
makes you a bad person,

885
00:44:25,683 --> 00:44:27,266
or you prioritize me
over the story,

886
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:28,801
which you think makes
you a bad reporter.

887
00:44:28,803 --> 00:44:31,638
Either way, you're wrong.
The source came to Neal

888
00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:33,940
and then I asked Neal
for his name and then...

889
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:36,392
- You can stop saying "his."
- What do you mean?

890
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:39,362
His name.
The source is a woman.

891
00:44:39,396 --> 00:44:41,564
I've spoken to her
in person twice.

892
00:44:41,615 --> 00:44:43,032
I know just as much
about her as you do.

893
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:45,702
Why are you standing in front
of a judge and not me?

894
00:44:45,736 --> 00:44:47,620
Oh, God.

895
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:51,240
You can't ever repeat
what you just said.

896
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:54,758
_

897
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:58,331
<i>- Mr.
- McAvoy refused to comply</i>

898
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,999
<i>with an order of this court.</i>

899

to hold a grand jury
witness in contempt

902
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:12,145
if he refuses the order
and does so without just cause.

903
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,846
We're here today to determine

904
00:45:13,897 --> 00:45:16,349
if the witness
can show just cause.

905
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:19,068
Miss Halliday,
I'll hear argument for the witness.

906
00:45:19,103 --> 00:45:21,604
Thank you, Your Honor.
And may it please the court.

907
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:25,241
Mr. McAvoy's cause exists
because he is protected

908
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:27,493
by a reporter's privilege
to withhold information,

909
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:31,197
a privilege that's been recognized
by a wide range of courts.

910
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:46,546
<i>If we were to
apply that test here,</i>

911
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:49,465
we would find that the information
given by the reporter's source

912
00:45:49,516 --> 00:45:51,184
poses no harm to the public

913
00:45:51,218 --> 00:45:52,552
and we would weigh that

914
00:45:52,603 --> 00:45:54,771
against the newsworthiness
of the US government

915
00:45:54,805 --> 00:45:58,191
swift-boating a foreign
election with disinformation

916
00:45:58,225 --> 00:46:01,394
that got 38 people,
including three Americans, killed.

917
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,066
No one disputes that this is a tragic
story of unintended consequences.

918
00:46:07,117 --> 00:46:09,035
No one intended
for anyone to die

919
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:11,070
and no one did
anything illegal.

920
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:14,123
<i>Our intelligence professionals
engage in covert operations</i>

921
00:46:14,158 --> 00:46:17,076
<i>all over the world to keep us safe.
It's their job.</i>

922
00:46:17,127 --> 00:46:20,079
It's how we won World War II.
It's how we won the Cold War.

923
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:21,748
<i>It's how the Berlin Wall fell</i>

924
00:46:21,799 --> 00:46:25,084
<i>and it's why more buildings
didn't fall on September 12.</i>

925
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:27,887
But not only can't they do
their jobs if their identities

926
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:30,139
are revealed by a rogue
government worker,

927
00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:32,725
<i>their lives and the lives
of their families</i>

928
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,560
will be put
at great risk immediately

929
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:36,262
and perhaps without
even their knowledge.

930
00:46:36,264 --> 00:46:39,398
Judge, when they do their jobs recklessly,
the public has a right to know.

931
00:46:39,433 --> 00:46:42,151
And how does someone who isn't
an experienced professional

932
00:46:42,186 --> 00:46:44,771
in the clandestine
services presume to know

933
00:46:44,822 --> 00:46:46,522
when one of our agents
is doing their job well?

934
00:46:46,573 --> 00:46:50,443
In this case,
we can put a stethoscope on the 38 bodies.

935
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:53,863
The court is sufficiently convinced
of the news value of this story.

936
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:56,866
Mr. Lasenthal,
please speak to any harm it poses.

937
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,669
Judge,
someone with a high level of security clearance

938
00:46:59,703 --> 00:47:01,587
has committed an act
of espionage.

939
00:47:01,622 --> 00:47:03,172
That fact is not in dispute.

940
00:47:03,207 --> 00:47:05,124
<i>This person is still
inside the government,</i>

941
00:47:05,175 --> 00:47:07,877
<i>still has access
to classified materials.</i>

942
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:09,762
This person must be
apprehended.

943
00:47:09,797 --> 00:47:13,099
Law enforcement doesn't know the identity.
Mr. McAvoy does.

944
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:16,602
And I can't imagine what other
argument the court needs to hear.

945
00:47:19,022 --> 00:47:21,524
Mr. McAvoy.

946
00:47:21,558 --> 00:47:23,476
What do you want me to do?

947
00:47:26,063 --> 00:47:28,231
Your Honor,
if you're leaving it up to me,

948
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:30,032
I'd just as soon go home.

949
00:47:32,035 --> 00:47:35,538
It's funny, but the first time the
Supreme Court ever supported a claim

950
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:39,408
of protection under the First
Amendment wasn't until 1919.

951
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:41,661
<i>The amendment says
Congress shall make no law</i>

952
00:47:41,712 --> 00:47:44,297
abridging freedom of speech
or of the press.

953
00:47:44,331 --> 00:47:46,382
And we went 125 years

954
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:49,468
without that law protecting
critical expression.

955
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:52,672
The legislation that
sparked the dissent?

956
00:47:52,674 --> 00:47:54,423
The Espionage Act.

957
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,895
I just thought
that was interesting.

958
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:03,983
I appreciate the defense
my attorney mounted,

959
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:06,269
but my heart is with
the prosecutor.

960
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,904
I'm sorry, Rebecca, it just is.

961
00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:09,772
It didn't used to be
that so much damage

962
00:48:09,823 --> 00:48:11,607
could be done by so few people.

963
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:14,393
It just used to be harder.
It took more manpower.

964
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:17,496
So, for me,
I don't like the cost benefit.

965
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:21,250
But I can't give you
the name of my source.

966
00:48:21,285 --> 00:48:23,536
I'm just not allowed to,
Your Honor.

967
00:48:23,538 --> 00:48:26,205
It's as simple as that.
I'm not allowed to.

968
00:48:27,174 --> 00:48:28,424
And as Your Honor well knows,

969
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,843
prison time
in a civil contempt case

970
00:48:30,878 --> 00:48:32,595
can't be punitive,
only coercive.

971
00:48:32,629 --> 00:48:36,215
So with that in mind,
I'm telling the government and the court

972
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,551
that there are no number
of prison days

973
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:42,772
after which I will reveal
my source's identity.

974
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,063
Well, I hate to say this,
but we're just going to have to find out.

975
00:48:51,114 --> 00:48:54,483
Mr. McAvoy,
I find you in contempt of court

976
00:48:54,534 --> 00:48:57,453
and order you to surrender
yourself to the US Marshals

977
00:48:57,487 --> 00:49:00,456
in this building
on this day at 5:00 PM.

978
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:03,459
Yes, sir.

979
00:49:16,757 --> 00:49:19,308
Hey, you know this is bullshit.

980
00:49:22,095 --> 00:49:23,679
I don't think you
should wait for me.

981
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,181
I think you should forget
about me and move on.

982
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:27,400
- Okay.
- Listen, remember,

983
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:30,319
only my conversations
with my lawyer are privileged.

984
00:49:30,354 --> 00:49:32,238
Right?
What we were talking about last night.

985
00:49:32,272 --> 00:49:35,074
- Yeah, or your wife.
- Yeah, but you wanted to be a June bride...

986
00:49:35,108 --> 00:49:36,826
I don't anymore.
I want to get married now.

987
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,945
I think you should have
thought about that... Wait.

988
00:49:38,947 --> 00:49:41,414
- Are you serious?
- I'm more than serious.

989
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:42,999
We get a waiver
from the mayor's office

990
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:44,750
and use the chapel
at City Hall.

991
00:49:44,785 --> 00:49:46,869
Honey, we've got 300 people
coming to a wedding

992
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,754
you've been planning
for 25 years.

993
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:51,374
Remember the seven weeks I
spent picking the invitations?

994
00:49:51,425 --> 00:49:54,627
- I really do.
- Done.

995
00:49:54,678 --> 00:49:57,797
"I'm marrying Will today at 3:30 PM at City Hall..."

996
00:49:57,799 --> 00:49:59,548
"...if you guys
want to come."

997
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,851
- Congratulations!
- Finally!

998
00:50:01,935 --> 00:50:04,020
That... That's what...
I was begging...

999
00:50:04,054 --> 00:50:05,888
for seven weeks
we were looking...

1000
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:08,641
Different cardboard...
Okay.

1001
00:50:08,643 --> 00:50:10,609
For that little stunt,
I'm gonna marry your ass off.

1002
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:13,529
Charlie, Don, Gary, Jim, Martin,
we're putting on a wedding.

1003
00:50:13,563 --> 00:50:15,781
- This is men's work.
- All right.

1004
00:50:15,816 --> 00:50:18,818
- Let's go. City Hall, here we come.
- You finally grew a brain.

1005
00:52:19,461 --> 00:52:23,039
_

1006
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:51,437
- I saw on the news.
- Thanks for seeing me, Phil.

1007
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:53,305
You really want to spend
your last hours of freedom

1008
00:52:53,356 --> 00:52:55,691
arguing with me about something
that's 2,000 years old?

1009
00:52:55,725 --> 00:52:58,527
No, we can do that another time.
I wanted to ask a favor.

1010
00:52:58,562 --> 00:53:01,397
Mac and I have moved our wedding
up from June to this afternoon.

1011
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:04,200
MacKenzie, while not being as religious as,
say, you are,

1012
00:53:04,234 --> 00:53:06,819
- she's not a full-on whack job or anything...
- Yeah.

1013
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:10,489
She is devout and a Catholic
service would mean a lot to her.

1014
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:12,541
I can do that.
Where are you being married?

1015
00:53:12,576 --> 00:53:14,910
At the chapel at City Hall.

1016
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:17,830
Catholic service has to be
performed in a Catholic church.

1017
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:20,633
Doesn't that sound like one of
those rules we've talked about?

1018
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:24,420
God's omniscient,
but He's only willing to work in certain buildings?

1019
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:27,423
- That's not...
- Like it's a union thing.

1020
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:29,175
Fine.

1021
00:53:29,177 --> 00:53:32,394
Thank you.
I'll have a car waiting at 3:15.

1022
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:37,933
Will.

1023
00:53:37,984 --> 00:53:39,685
You want to pray with me?

1024
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:53,764
♪ Ave Maria ♪

1025
00:54:05,462 --> 00:54:08,062
♪ Gratia plena... ♪

1026
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,055
You have to make
a grand apology to her.

1027
00:54:16,057 --> 00:54:17,940
- Really grand.
- I know.

1028
00:54:17,974 --> 00:54:21,227
- Canyon grand.
- I know.

1029
00:54:21,278 --> 00:54:24,113
- Where's Professor Ethics?
- We had a fight.

1030
00:54:24,147 --> 00:54:26,782
About what?

1031
00:54:26,816 --> 00:54:28,484
Nothing.

1032
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:41,914
Rejoice with those who rejoice.

1033
00:54:41,965 --> 00:54:44,750
Weep with those who weep.

1034
00:54:44,752 --> 00:54:46,835
Have the same regard
for one another.

1035
00:54:46,886 --> 00:54:50,222
Do not be haughty,
but associate with the lowly.

1036
00:54:50,257 --> 00:54:53,008
<i>Do not be wise
in your own estimation.</i>

1037
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:00,933
<i>Do not repay anyone
evil for evil.</i>

1038
00:55:00,984 --> 00:55:03,936
<i>Be concerned for what is noble
in the sight of all.</i>

1039
00:55:03,938 --> 00:55:07,273
If possible, on your part,

1040
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:09,441
live at peace with all.

1041
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:12,494
- The word of the Lord.
- Thanks be to God.

1042
00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:29,178
Do you take this man to be
your lawful wedded husband?

1043
00:55:30,714 --> 00:55:32,631
I do.

1044
00:55:32,682 --> 00:55:35,968
<i>Do you take this woman to be
your lawful wedded wife?</i>

1045
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:39,221
I do.

1046
