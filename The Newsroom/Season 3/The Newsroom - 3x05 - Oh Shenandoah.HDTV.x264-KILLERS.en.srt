_

3
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:27,908
Since I got here,
you're my third contempt of court.

4
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:29,993
First one was a contested
traffic ticket.

5
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:32,529
The guy cursed at the judge.
The second one was a lawyer.

6
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:34,915
- What'd he do?
- He cursed at the judge.

7
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,534
You're my first reporter.

8
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,202
I'm Will.
I'd shake your hand...

9
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:41,455
I know who you are.

10
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:43,757
<i>So the traffic ticket,
he was just here for a night.</i>

11
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,592
<i>But the lawyer was here
for a weekend.</i>

12
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:48,679
Three nights,
and you could tell he was starting to go a little...

13
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:52,516
You know, it affected him.

14
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:55,719
<i>You're gonna be
locked in a cage now,</i>

15
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:57,938
<i>and it's not a natural thing.</i>

16
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:00,057
Go ahead.

17
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:01,942
That's yours over here.

18
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:06,029
- You got toiletries?
- I'm sorry?

19
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:07,564
You didn't bring toiletries?

20
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:09,700
Uh, no, I didn't.

21
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,401
<i>I'll bring you toothpaste
and a brush.</i>

22
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:13,487
<i>I can bring you a book
from the library if you want.</i>

23
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:16,707
- You might get the whole weekend.
- Sure, thanks.

24
00:02:16,742 --> 00:02:18,792
You'll be fine.

25
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:30,277
_

26
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:37,394
<i>You fish.</i>

27
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:40,063
I'm sorry?

28
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:42,683
You're a fisherman.

29
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,069
Yeah. No.
Not in a long time.

30
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,822
That's a nice fish.

31
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:50,941
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Eight pounds.

32
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:52,859
You know,
I don't really remember.

33
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:54,444
<i>And that's your father
there next to you?</i>

34
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:57,614
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- That's a wholesome picture.

35
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,416
Looks like it came
with the frame.

36
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:01,618
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- And that's your wife?

37
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,453
Yeah, her name is MacKenzie.

38
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:05,789
- <i>Whew, she's a knockout.</i>
- She is.

39
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:08,542
- <i>It's okay if I say that, right?</i>
- Sure.

40
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:11,845
<i>And those are your, what?
Your friends, your colleagues?</i>

41
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:16,299
Yeah,
they're some of the people I work with.

42
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:18,301
We work close together.

43
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:21,271
- You have to explain it to me one more time.
- Really?

44
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:24,357
<i>'Cause every time you say it,
it sounds like you're in here voluntarily.</i>

45
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:25,642
I promise you, I'm not.

46
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:27,778
But you can walk out
any time you want.

47
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:29,780
No, I can't.
I can only walk out

48
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:32,149
if I reveal the identity
of a source.

49
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:35,068
- You want to read your book.
<i>- I don't want to be rude.</i>

50
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,873
<i>You didn't ask me what I was in for.
I appreciate that.</i>

51
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:44,828
Domestic battery.

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,414
Nine women on the jury.

53
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:51,334
<i>My PD was a woman,
so she wasn't exactly my champion.</i>

54
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:54,888
The prosecutor was a woman.
The judge was a woman.

55
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:57,007
<i>I mean,
is that even constitutional?</i>

56
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:59,342
The PD wanted me to plea...
Six months.

57
00:03:59,394 --> 00:04:01,928
But I wanted to fight it...
Two years.

58
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,815
<i>That wasn't your first offense,
though.</i>

59
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,683
How do you know?

60
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:09,903
You wouldn't have gotten two years for
domestic battery if it was your first...

61
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:12,189
It was my third.
Strike three.

62
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:15,192
Oh, are you judging me now?

63
00:04:15,244 --> 00:04:17,194
'Cause a judge just did that.
I don't need it.

64
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:19,246
- No.
- Yeah, you are.

65
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,979
I have an idea.

66
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:23,667
Tell me the name of the source.

67
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:25,335
<i>I didn't make
a pledge or anything.</i>

68
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,705
I'll tell it to them on the
condition they let us both go.

69
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:30,207
It's a hell of a plan.

70
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,542
Or I could just shake
the name out of you.

71
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:35,796
Stand up.

72
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:39,966
I want you to see that I
got four inches on you

73
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,719
and you're giving up 30 pounds.
I'm not your wife.

74
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,554
Raise your hands
above your hips

75
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:47,974
and I'll knock you
the fuck into next week.

76
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,901
Your father was a drunk,
wasn't he?

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,907
<i>You aren't a consumer,
you're a citizen.</i>

78
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:06,743
<i>You aren't an audience,
you're an activist.</i>

79
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:09,212
<i>You aren't a viewer,
you're ACN.</i>

80
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:11,915
<i>You are ACN.</i>

81
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,342
Which one of you...

82
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,761
It's as offensive as I thought it
was gonna be when I heard about it.

83
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,930
- Offensive to whom?
- Me. And him.

84
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:30,233
And Will and Sloan and everyone
who works here and you.

85
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,518
We are ACN.

86
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,436
It's a slogan.
It doesn't mean anything.

87
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:35,939
First, I wouldn't be relieved that our
new slogan doesn't mean anything.

88
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:37,440
- I meant...
- But it isn't a slogan.

89
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:39,609
It's a statement
of our new direction.

90
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:42,829
We're gonna cover the conversation
because this is just the first one.

91
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:44,865
Next one's gonna show
citizen journalists

92
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:46,666
filing stories
from the Coffee Bean.

93
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:49,002
- Don?
- It looks like urine.

94
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:51,621
It doesn't.
You're just complaining for the sake of it.

95
00:05:51,673 --> 00:05:53,707
The best graphics house
in the UK

96
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,376
was paid $700,000
to build that spot.

97
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:59,379
I don't mean the animation.
U-R-A-C-N.

98
00:05:59,431 --> 00:06:01,548
Our brains are trained to see
groups of letters as a word

99
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,934
and visually that group of
letters looks like urine.

100
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:07,470
Maybe if we separate
the U and the R.

101
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:08,972
Maybe,
but the best you can hope for

102
00:06:08,974 --> 00:06:11,191
is something with the gravitas
of a vanity license plate.

103
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:14,027
<i>- Maybe we should ask people to vote.
- After all, they are ACN.</i>

104
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:16,613
- You know, Mac...
- Young people know when they're being patronized.

105
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:18,114
Everybody knows when
they're being patronized.

106
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,200
I've been hearing this
for 52 days.

107
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:22,535
Because in 52 days,

108
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:25,155
I've put three Twitter
monitors on our set.

109
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:28,625
Passing weather systems are reported
like al-Qaeda sleeper cells.

110
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,495
And a total of 84 air minutes have
been spent on the mayor of Toronto

111
00:06:32,547 --> 00:06:34,831
while zero minutes have been
spent on the mayor of Detroit

112
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,251
whose city is about two
minutes away from bankruptcy.

113
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:40,503
Also in that 52 days,
we've gone from fourth

114
00:06:40,505 --> 00:06:42,973
to third in households
and second in the demo.

115
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,842
In seven weeks,
the average age of our audience

116
00:06:45,894 --> 00:06:47,510
has dropped three years.

117
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:50,764
And we did all that while
still managing to cover

118
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:53,316
<i>a military takeover in Egypt</i>

119
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:57,520
and most recently,
a pretty big scandal involving the NSA.

120
00:06:57,572 --> 00:07:00,573
We've got two reporters at the
Moscow Airport right now.

121
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:04,411
Two. So can you do me
a favor and not worry

122
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,080
that the world's
most benign promo

123
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:09,082
is a threat to democracy?

124
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:10,617
- Sure.
- You?

125
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,836
- Can I have a second?
- Yeah.

126
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,340
So, the Princeton story.
The website.

127
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,592
There is an epidemic

128
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:21,878
of campus sexual assaults
in this country.

129
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
It's a perfectly
legitimate story.

130
00:07:23,932 --> 00:07:27,133
In fact, it's an important one,
so what's your fucking problem?

131
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:28,852
I agree.

132
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,720
I just don't know
how to do the story.

133
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:33,223
- I don't understand.
- I don't know how to do it. I'm looking for some guidance.

134
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,308
You interview the student
with the website.

135
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,561
You interview one of the guys who's been accused.
Why is it complicated?

136
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:40,697
Well,
it's complicated for a lot of reasons,

137
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:43,233
and one of them is that Pruit
wants them both in the studio.

138
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:45,618
- He told you that?
<i>- He called me.</i>

139
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:53,376
He shouldn't be speaking
directly to you.

140
00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:55,628
And he shouldn't be
making those decisions.

141
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:58,081
But if that's what he wants,
why don't you just do it?

142
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:05,171
Well, like I said,
I don't know how to.

143
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:06,673
Bullshit.

144
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:09,009
You do know how.

145
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:13,346
And if you don't,
I need to hire someone who does, man.

146
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:14,981
Okay?

147
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,350
Yeah.

148
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:20,270
Anything else?

149
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:21,938
No.

150
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:36,670
Anything happen over the
weekend I should know about?

151
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:38,505
Not much.

152
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,924
Dilma Rousseff pledged
to speak with protestors.

153
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,343
- The House voted down the Farm Bill.
- Yeah, I saw that.

154
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:46,429
France is sending Syrian rebels
17.6 tons of medical aid.

155
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:48,631
I'm sure that's going to get
where it's supposed to go.

156
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,717
<i>A woman named Lilly M. Hart
shot herself in the mouth</i>

157
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:52,769
on the steps in front
of the Justice Department.

158
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:54,554
We're not sure what
she was protesting,

159
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:57,557
but her bio had a lot of gun
control advocacy in it.

160
00:08:57,609 --> 00:08:59,442
She was protesting guns
by shooting herself?

161
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:01,644
The FBI isn't releasing
any information right now.

162
00:09:01,646 --> 00:09:03,947
- You mean DC Police.
- No, the FBI is handling it.

163
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:07,033
- Why?
- They won't release that information either.

164
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:08,485
Anything else?

165
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,653
Kim and Kanye named
their baby North.

166
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,622
There's our top story.

167
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:15,325
What was her name?

168
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:17,494
North. North West.

169
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:19,996
No, the woman who shot
herself in front of the DOJ.

170
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:21,664
Lilly Hart.

171
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,467
<i>Again, I don't know how...</i>

172
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,337
What?

173
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,308
She wasn't protesting guns.

174
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:37,180
They said it was an emergency.
Is everything okay?

175
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:39,099
Do we have attorney-client privilege,
you and me?

176
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,518
- I'm not your lawyer.
- What if you were?

177
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,269
Then we would have
that privilege.

178
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:47,607
I'm hiring you right now
on a $20 retainer.

179
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,859
- Do I need to sign something?
- No. What's going on?

180
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,112
I know the name of the source.

181
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:54,697
I've known since the party after
the Correspondents' Dinner.

182
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:56,199
And the day before yesterday,
she shot

183
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:58,535
and killed herself on
the steps outside the DOJ.

184
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:01,371
The woman...
She was the source?

185
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:02,922
Yeah.

186
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,507
Who else knows the name?

187
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:06,209
Neal, obviously, Will, and I.
That's it.

188
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,845
- Not the DC Police?
- I think they must...

189
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,431
Excuse me.

190
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,266
Thank you.

191
00:10:13,301 --> 00:10:15,385
Lasenthal on the phone.

192
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,722
You know what?

193
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:22,392
Your husband is getting
out of jail today.

194
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,977
_

195
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:35,872
I was just chewed out for
10 minutes by Erin Andrews.

196
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:38,041
- Why?
- She was accosted by paparazzi last night

197
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:39,959
coming out of <i>Man of Steel</i>
at the El Capitan in LA.

198
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:41,327
Paparazzi were coming
out of the El Capitan?

199
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,079
- She...
- She was coming.

200
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:44,747
She'd just seen the movie and
waiting for her were a pack of paparazzi.

201
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:46,166
<i>Got it.
Why was she chewing you out?</i>

202
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:47,383
I'm the one here
she knows the best.

203
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,751
Didn't she have
an affair with Will?

204
00:10:48,753 --> 00:10:50,920
It wasn't an affair.
Neither of them were married.

205
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:52,889
No, that didn't happen.
Will's in jail at the moment.

206
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:54,724
And none of this is the point.

207
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,010
The paparazzi knew she was in there
because of our creepy stalker app.

208
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:58,928
I'm coming to you
as my superior,

209
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,431
which I mean only in a sense
of our organizational chart,

210
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,099
and pleading with you
to have what's his name...

211
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:05,351
- Bree.
- Bree shut down the app.

212
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:06,936
Mac's been fighting
that battle for six weeks.

213
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:09,856
- And what have you been doing?
- Just, you know, my job.

214
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:12,742
Which should now include getting
the assassin's helper taken down.

215
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:13,943
- I'm on it.
- When?

216
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:17,664
Well, I'm in the middle of a tricky...
Now.

217
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,666
- Right now.
- There you go.

218
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:25,672
Excuse me, Bree.

219
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:28,458
Excuse me.

220
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,630
Hey, easy.

221
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,765
- I just wanted to talk to you about something.
- You are?

222
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,850
He's Don Keefer, executive producer...
You know who he is.

223
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:40,720
- And you run our website until Neal Sampat's back.
- I wanted to...

224
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:43,439
I'm senior editor of ACN Digital,
if you're going to be insulting.

225
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,475
- Nobody wants to be insulting.
- I badly want to be insulting.

226
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:47,477
Here's the thing...
Sloan got a call from Erin Andrews...

227
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:48,645
- You know Erin Andrews?
- Yes.

228
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,947
Yowza.
I want to get with that so bad.

229
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:53,983
I'll pass that on.
I'm sure she'll want you to have her number.

230
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:55,785
- Hey, fuck you.
- Yeah?

231
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,621
- You can't talk to her like that, my friend.
- What's the problem here?

232
00:11:58,657 --> 00:12:01,324
Erin Andrews got stopped by paparazzi
last night coming out of the movies.

233
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:03,493
- I know, we've got it up.
- Now we're in Peabody country.

234
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:05,245
You're here to give me shit
about the app again.

235
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:07,964
Yes. Restraining Order.
Scum Bottle Guide.

236
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:09,716
- Whatever it's called.
- ACNgage.

237
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:11,334
It should be called
ACinvoluntary Engage.

238
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:13,002
I'll bring that up
at our next staff meeting.

239
00:12:13,054 --> 00:12:14,971
You guys like
ACinvoluntary Engage?

240
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:16,889
- No.
- It got voted down.

241
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:20,143
Listen, no kidding around,
you need to disable the app until we can figure this out,

242
00:12:20,178 --> 00:12:23,263
- 'cause it's a little not what we do.
- What's not what you do?

243
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:25,481
Giving deranged people with
access to semiautomatic weapons

244
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,850
the locations of their
targets while simultaneously

245
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:29,435
turning the rest
of our brains into Wheatena.

246
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:30,937
That app's driving
a lot of traffic.

247
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:32,905
I don't care if it's driving
in the Grand Prix of Monaco.

248
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:34,324
I need you to temporarily
take it down.

249
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,609
- Then permanently take it down.
- You need to speak to my boss.

250
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:37,860
- He's your boss.
- I'm your boss.

251
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:39,412
Lucas Pruit is my boss.
I pitched him the app

252
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:41,281
and he loved it,
which is why we have it.

253
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:44,867
This is a warmed-over version of the same app
Gawker had and took down five years ago.

254
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,619
They still have a version of it,
but this one's better.

255
00:12:46,671 --> 00:12:48,171
- <i>Look...</i>
- No, you look.

256
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:49,339
We're all a little tired
of being treated

257
00:12:49,374 --> 00:12:51,257
like we're not Neal Sampat.

258
00:12:51,293 --> 00:12:53,543
I like my app
and it makes money,

259
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:55,845
both of which are more than I
can say for your 10:00 hour.

260
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,014
So if you have a problem,
and I got a hunch you got more than a few,

261
00:12:58,049 --> 00:12:59,966
why don't you take it to Pruit?

262
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,887
Beat him up.

263
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:07,440
No, he's right.

264
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:08,941
Yeah, he's... What?

265
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:11,894
About the last thing he said.
About the last thing you said.

266
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:13,613
We haven't been very welcoming

267
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:17,033
and in a weird way we've
been blaming him for Neal.

268
00:13:17,068 --> 00:13:20,320
If Digital can help us,
we should be supporting Digital.

269
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:22,622
- That's right.
- Yeah.

270
00:13:22,657 --> 00:13:24,457
Come on the show and tell
people about your app.

271
00:13:24,492 --> 00:13:27,577
Seriously?

272
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,996
I'll ask MacKenzie for a block
and I'll interview you.

273
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:32,548
All right.
Awesome.

274
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,834
An associate producer
will give you the details.

275
00:13:34,886 --> 00:13:36,669
- You should apologize.
- Sorry.

276
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:38,888
- To him.
- Habit. Sorry.

277
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:40,089
Were you serious about
that phone number?

278
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:42,592
Yeah,
but I think you can do better.

279
00:13:42,594 --> 00:13:44,727
- For real?
- I'm on it.

280
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:51,851
Okay,
so when you vivisect this guy

281
00:13:51,903 --> 00:13:53,770
and especially his app,
Pruit's not gonna be happy.

282
00:13:53,822 --> 00:13:55,571
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

283
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:57,774
You usually blow up that
bridge when you come to it.

284
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:00,326
Would you mind giving me some space?
I have a show to prepare.

285
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:01,861
<i>Sure, but this is my office.</i>

286
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:03,363
Yes, it is.
Sorry.

287
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:05,365
Hang on.

288
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:07,834
There's an undergrad at
Princeton who started a website

289
00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:10,203
for students who have been raped,
but who don't have enough evidence

290
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:11,671
for the police to take action.

291
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:15,425
Victims can go onto the site
either anonymously or not

292
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,961
and name names and describe
their experiences.

293
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:23,716
Pruit wants the undergrad and one
of the accused in the studio.

294
00:14:23,768 --> 00:14:24,967
- That's a terrible idea.
- I know.

295
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:26,636
- Do you have a better one?
- Don't do it?

296
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:29,639
Do you have a better one
where I get to keep my job?

297
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:32,058
- Charlie's gonna back you.
- Charlie told me to do it.

298
00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:37,647
What's happening to him?

299
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:41,734
I think you should consider
letting me do the talking.

300
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:44,404
At least at the top.
We won't have much time with him

301
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,489
and I want to ask him,
obviously, the extent

302
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:48,241
to which they've been
keeping metadata,

303
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,460
how much the agency learns
from this kind of information,

304
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:52,712
and in what ways the FISA
reports have provided

305
00:14:52,747 --> 00:14:54,497
insufficient oversight
of the NSA.

306
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:57,500
I want to ask him at what point he decided
to declare war on the United States.

307
00:14:57,552 --> 00:14:59,752
So I think you should
let me get the ball rolling.

308
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:02,171
You and your whole generation's
contempt for institutions.

309
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:03,556
I'm two years younger than you.

310
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,141
With your hair and your
clothes and your music.

311
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:06,559
Here it is.
Here's the gate.

312
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:07,643
You sure?

313
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,980
It says departs
for Havana at 11:55 PM.

314
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:13,816
- Are you sure?
- We had a nine-hour flight from New York.

315
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:16,269
I was brushing up on my Russian
with my Russian phrase book,

316
00:15:16,321 --> 00:15:19,939
or <i>Russkiy razgovornik</i>,
while you were watching <i>Star Wars</i> on your iPad.

317
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:21,691
Trek. <i>Star Trek</i>.

318
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:24,160
Both excellent
examples of genius,

319
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:26,329
- but different in every imaginable...
- Yeah, shut up.

320
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:27,864
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

321
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:35,371
<i>Then we'll speak in English.</i>

322
00:15:35,373 --> 00:15:37,039
You're American press, yes?

323
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:40,042
I have not seen Edward Snowden.
I do not know where he is.

324
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:41,878
That's all right.
We just want to check in

325
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,513
for the midnight
flight to Havana.

326
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,598
That's Aeroflot seven,
departing 11:55?

327
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:48,351
Yes.
Margaret Jordan and James Humdrum.

328
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:50,853
Harper.

329
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:53,556
That guy's from
ABC's Moscow bureau.

330
00:15:54,776 --> 00:15:57,393
And that's Reuters
and that's <i>Le Monde</i>.

331
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:59,979
He's going to Cuba.
He's gonna be on this flight.

332
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:02,148
<i>I do not show reservation
for Margaret Jordan.</i>

333
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,900
- Really?
- I'll try Humdrum.

334
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:05,318
Harper.
James Harper.

335
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,955
The office bought our tickets
while we were in the air.

336
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,290
I do not show reservation
for Harper.

337
00:16:11,326 --> 00:16:12,792
Would you mind checking again?

338
00:16:12,827 --> 00:16:14,660
What do you think will
happen the second time?

339
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:18,998
Would you ask her
to check again?

340
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,717
- Would you mind checking again?
- In Russian.

341
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:24,754
I understood in English.
And I have checked again.

342
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:27,924
And lo and behold,
got the same result.

343
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:30,393
All right.
Can we have two coach seats to Havana?

344
00:16:30,428 --> 00:16:32,261
- The flight is sold out.
- Of course it is.

345
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,430
I'll call the office.

346
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:36,265
Unless the office can build
two seats and install them

347
00:16:36,267 --> 00:16:39,402
on the plane in the next four hours,
it's not gonna do any good.

348
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:45,525
Excuse me.
Do you speak English?

349
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:48,277
- <i>Agence France.</i>
- You speak French. Great.

350
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,363
- I speak English, too.
- Okay.

351
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:54,116
'Cause when I said...
It doesn't matter.

352
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:57,370
I would like to buy your ticket
from you at a substantial markup.

353
00:16:57,422 --> 00:16:59,539
- How substantial?
- Twice what your office paid for it.

354
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:01,624
You can catch the next flight
and pocket the difference.

355
00:17:01,676 --> 00:17:03,676
- That's a good deal.
- Yes, it is.

356
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:05,461
I don't have a ticket
for the flight.

357
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:07,129
- You don't?
<i>- No.</i>

358
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,798
What are you doing here?

359
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,767
I'm here to photograph
Mr. Snowden.

360
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:14,103
This is a very big story.
You agree?

361
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:16,138
I do.

362
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,274
I do agree.

363
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:26,649
We have to get on this flight.

364
00:17:29,704 --> 00:17:32,655
When did you decide you wanted
to be a TV news anchor?

365
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:34,707
Do you know how long this
interview is gonna take?

366
00:17:34,742 --> 00:17:38,494
- <i>You've got someplace else you're going?</i>
- No.

367
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,580
When did you decide you wanted
to be a TV news anchor?

368
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:43,332
I didn't. I was a prosecutor.
Then I was a speechwriter.

369
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:46,168
Then I was the legal correspondent
for my network and I got promoted.

370
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,171
- You were a prosecutor?
- The Brooklyn DA's office.

371
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:52,224
<i>You aren't afraid you're gonna run into
some of the people you sent here?</i>

372
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,010
That's why I'm supposed
to be in solitary.

373
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:55,678
And you were
what kind of writer?

374
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,847
Speechwriter.

375
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:59,899
What does that mean?

376
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:02,602
I helped write speeches for
the first President Bush.

377
00:18:02,654 --> 00:18:05,905
I worked on his campaign and when he won,
they brought me to the White House.

378
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,858
No kidding?
George H.W.?

379
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,527
- Yeah.
- Did you ever meet him?

380
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:13,412
Yeah.

381
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:15,114
Ah. I liked him.

382
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,284
He was an elite Harvard
silver spoon and all that,

383
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:19,702
but he didn't rub it in your face,
you know?

384
00:18:19,754 --> 00:18:22,505
- He went to Yale.
- He didn't do that.

385
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,423
He didn't make people
feel stupid.

386
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:26,709
- That's not what I was doing.
- What?

387
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:29,378
You were just saying
that to the fatheads,

388
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,847
<i>there's no difference
between Yale and Harvard.</i>

389
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:34,050
But to the refined palate
of the eastern elite,

390
00:18:34,102 --> 00:18:35,768
- <i>the subtle nuances...</i>
- Jesus, I'm from Nebraska!

391
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:38,020
You still got that northeastern
air of superiority.

392
00:18:38,056 --> 00:18:40,640
- I'm in jail!
- And even in here you still think you're better than me.

393
00:18:40,692 --> 00:18:44,393
You hit a woman, man.
You don't set the bar very high.

394
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:46,896
<i>- Will.</i>
- Yeah?

395
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:49,482
- You got visitors.
- On a Monday?

396
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,791
- I'll be outside the door.
- You look good.

397
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:02,211
- Yeah, you say that every week.
- It's true every week.

398
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:03,412
How you holding up?

399
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:05,581
I'm good.
What's this about?

400
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:08,801
He's going to ask you a couple of
questions I've already approved.

401
00:19:08,836 --> 00:19:11,337
But if you need a minute,
take a minute.

402
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:13,756
- He'll step outside.
- What's going on?

403
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:15,391
The day before yesterday,
Saturday morning,

404
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:17,927
<i>a woman named Lilly Hart
committed suicide</i>

405
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:21,180
<i>by shooting herself in the head on the
steps of the Justice Department.</i>

406
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:23,065
Does the name Lilly Hart
mean anything to you?

407
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,100
That wasn't one of the
questions we went over.

408
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:26,435
- All right.
<i>- Stick to the script.</i>

409
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:29,071
Lilly Hart worked for BCD.

410
00:19:29,107 --> 00:19:31,774
Her roommate and some of her friends
were trying to put the pieces together,

411
00:19:31,826 --> 00:19:35,027
<i>trying to figure out why she killed
herself and so theatrically.</i>

412
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,663
- Mm-hmm.
- Her roommate starts going through her emails

413
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:41,000
and then some files,
and she finds some things which are alarming enough

414
00:19:41,035 --> 00:19:45,287
for her to bring to the attention of
some agents who sweep the entire laptop.

415
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:49,208
Will you confirm
Lilly Hart as your source?

416
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,128
No, sir.

417
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:56,632
- Will you deny that she was your source?
- No, sir.

418
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:59,101
- <i>You're not under oath.</i>
- I understand.

419
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:01,020
Lilly Hart has no family.

420
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:03,639
Both her parents died
in a car crash years ago.

421
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:05,274
She's single with no children.

422
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:08,110
There's no one
to protect anymore.

423
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:10,396
Confirm the name,

424
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:13,149
and I'll inform the judge
that the government

425
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:16,035
no longer needs your testimony
and has withdrawn their subpoena

426
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,822
<i>and you'll be having dinner with
your wife in your home tonight.</i>

427
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:21,957
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not allowed

428
00:20:21,993 --> 00:20:24,660
to reveal the name of a source
without their permission.

429
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:26,996
<i>Well,
that option was taken off the table</i>

430
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:29,832
when your source put
a loaded Beretta 9mm Nano

431
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:31,333
in her mouth
and squeezed the trigger.

432
00:20:31,335 --> 00:20:33,669
Don't do that.
Don't try the side door.

433
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:36,672
Look, confirm that she's the source
and Neal comes home from Venezuela.

434
00:20:36,724 --> 00:20:38,174
We'll buy the ticket.
First class.

435
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,142
And you won't pursue
criminal prosecution?

436
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:42,728
We'll give him
an ice cream cone.

437
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:45,815
Will you confirm that Lilly
Hart was your source?

438
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:48,434
No, sir.

439
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:52,488
- Will you deny it?
- No, sir.

440
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:58,327
Neal would pummel me if I got him back
by giving up the name of a source.

441
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:00,196
Did you think I was gonna
consider a deal like this?

442
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:02,248
I wrote down exactly
what I thought you'd say

443
00:21:02,283 --> 00:21:04,366
and sealed it in this envelope.

444
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:16,055
_

445
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:25,104
Can I speak to him?

446
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:27,973
<i>He's back in his cell.</i>

447
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,558
Mac.

448
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,894
When are they gonna be
absolutely sure?

449
00:21:31,896 --> 00:21:33,696
What percent of certainty
will it take?

450
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:36,649
- I'm gonna find out.
<i>- What if we switch places?</i>

451
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:39,652
- <i>I have the exact same information Will has.</i>
- Mac.

452
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:43,122
What if you convinced them I was softer
and more likely to give up the name?

453
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:44,490
- <i>Are you?</i>
- No.

454
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,041
Just a second.

455
00:21:46,077 --> 00:21:48,127
- What if you told them that...
- Listen to me.

456
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:50,079
'Cause here's your $20 worth.

457
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:52,915
You don't tell anyone
you know what Will knows.

458
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:55,417
You want your friends to be
subpoenaed and get sworn in?

459
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,586
No.
Come on in.

460
00:21:57,638 --> 00:22:00,339
Keep calling me.
I want to hear from you once an hour.

461
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:03,342
- What's going on?
- I need a block tonight. Five minutes, 4:30.

462
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:05,344
- For what?
- I want to interview Bree Dorrit.

463
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:08,731
Isn't that the temporary
ACN Digital editor?

464
00:22:08,766 --> 00:22:11,600
- Yeah.
<i>- Why do you want to interview someone who works for us?</i>

465
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:13,402
I want to discuss
an app he has...

466
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:16,772
We have called Human Flesh
Hunter or something.

467
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:18,607
I know I've missed
some meetings,

468
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,694
but we really don't have an app
called Hunting Human Flesh?

469
00:22:21,746 --> 00:22:23,112
No. Maybe.
I don't know.

470
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:25,331
I don't like to do
stories about us.

471
00:22:25,366 --> 00:22:27,533
I know,
but this is about everyone.

472
00:22:33,007 --> 00:22:37,092
Lady Gaga has been
relatively silent on Twitter

473
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:39,845
since her hip surgery
last February.

474
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:43,015
But today she broke
her silence and tweeted

475
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,634
in support of...
In defense of...

476
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:49,805
In support of overturning
the Defense of Marriage Act.

477
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:52,942
Sloan's going
to interview her manager.

478
00:22:54,368 --> 00:22:57,479
You're still able to hear
yourself when you speak, right?

479
00:22:57,481 --> 00:23:00,399
- Yeah.
- I'm glad Lady Gaga wants to engage people...

480
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:02,651
She has 40 million
Twitter followers.

481
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:05,487
Does her manager bring expertise
to the table on marriage equality?

482
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:07,489
What kind of expertise
is there on that subject?

483
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:10,125
- Someone who's familiar with state legislature.
- Just block out the time.

484
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:11,327
We don't have the time tonight.

485
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:12,795
We only have him for one night.

486
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,047
Well, I don't want to get
scooped on Gaga's manager.

487
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:16,999
Hey, you know what, Mac?

488
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:21,003
How about she brings 40 million
people to a civil rights debate?

489
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:23,589
I don't think gay couples
who'd just like to move

490
00:23:23,641 --> 00:23:25,808
the fuck on with their lives are
as choosy about that discussion.

491
00:23:25,843 --> 00:23:27,843
It was trending, Charlie.
It still is.

492
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:30,980
Lady Gaga's tweets,
they're trending number one.

493
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:33,565
So Pruit picked up the phone and said,
"Do this."

494
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:36,318
That's why you book her manager,
to report on the tweets.

495
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:37,653
Whatever.
Put it in the rundown.

496
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:39,655
- I don't have room.
- There's always room.

497
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,824
Tell me what you'd like to cut.

498
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:44,159
The Supreme Court
struck down portions

499
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:46,078
of the Voting Rights Act
this morning.

500
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:48,530
IAF fighter jets
attacked the Gaza Strip

501
00:23:48,532 --> 00:23:50,332
after rockets were fired
at southern Israel.

502
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:53,085
Ed Markey won John Kerry's
seat in the Senate.

503
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,703
- Snowden's on his way to Cuba.
- Cut my thing.

504
00:23:54,705 --> 00:23:56,088
I didn't have the time
for it anyway.

505
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:57,706
- What was it?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

506
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,758
- ACNgage?
- Yeah, how'd you know?

507
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:01,543
- Pruit wants it.
- How did he know?

508
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:04,797
The guy, Bree,
he's got a relationship with Pruit.

509
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:09,218
He told him you were putting him
on the air and Pruit liked it.

510
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,436
It's a promo for the site.

511
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:13,055
Yeah, that is what it is.

512
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:15,524
You'll have to cut something
else or make trims.

513
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,310
In an historic
5-4 decision,

514
00:24:18,362 --> 00:24:21,230
the US Supreme Court did something
that we'll tell you about tomorrow.

515
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:23,615
- We're clear, right?
- We are.

516
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:31,540
- I'm really sorry.
- Not your fault.

517
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:33,208
Tell me about
the five-minute interview

518
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:35,077
we're going to do
with ourselves.

519
00:24:44,755 --> 00:24:46,972
You sure you wouldn't rather
do this someplace else?

520
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:49,141
Those are the Footnotes.

521
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:50,893
The pitch pipe lives
in the room next door

522
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:52,895
and they practice
there sometimes.

523
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,431
You get used to it.
It's kind of nice.

524
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,349
I just meant...

525
00:24:57,401 --> 00:25:00,986
If I can avoid it, I'd rather not be alone
with a young woman in her dorm room.

526
00:25:01,022 --> 00:25:04,323
You want witnesses in case I
say you forced yourself on me.

527
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:06,158
- No, no.
- Don.

528
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:08,077
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- I was raped.

529
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:10,696
- I wasn't worried...
- I was raped.

530
00:25:10,748 --> 00:25:12,998
I went to a party
at one of the eating clubs.

531
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:14,450
I drank too much tequila.

532
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:17,286
There was molly, there was coke,
there were mushrooms,

533
00:25:17,338 --> 00:25:18,871
and I took anything
that was put in front of me.

534
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:21,924
<i>I wound up in a bathroom throwing
up and then passing out.</i>

535
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:26,178
And the next thing I knew,
two guys were helping me into a bedroom.

536
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:28,047
They told me
I needed to lie down.

537
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:31,050
When we got in there,
they took my clothes off

538
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:33,602
and they took turns raping me.

539
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:41,276
And the next day
you called the police?

540
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:44,363
City police, campus police,
and the DA's office.

541
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:47,066
I know who the two guys are
and I know where they live.

542
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:49,902
That should be the easiest arrest
they're ever going to make.

543
00:25:49,954 --> 00:25:52,204
- <i>Nobody pursued it.</i>
- The kind of rape you're talking about

544
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:55,040
- is difficult and usually impossible to prove.
- It's not a kind of rape.

545
00:25:55,076 --> 00:25:57,209
Sure.

546
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:03,999
How did you find me?

547
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:06,752
- The original email?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

548
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:08,754
Just some detective work.

549
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:10,589
I really want to know.

550
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:13,392
Well,
on the web page there's a bio.

551
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:15,511
You say you're
a third-year psych major.

552
00:26:15,513 --> 00:26:18,347
And later you say you live
across from Dillon Gym

553
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:20,899
and one of these days you're
gonna start working out.

554
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:23,819
- You also wrote that you love the Phat Lady.
- Right.

555
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:25,988
I got a list of all female
psych majors on campus

556
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:28,407
and cross-referenced it with students
living in the upperclassmen dorms

557
00:26:28,442 --> 00:26:30,576
across from the gym,
which brought me to Cuyler Hall.

558
00:26:30,611 --> 00:26:32,945
- Wow.
<i>- I asked some people in my office</i>

559
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,446
if they knew the band
the Phat Lady.

560
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:37,699
- Really?
- And a Princeton grad laughed and said...

561
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:40,702
- It's a sandwich.
- It is the most popular sandwich

562
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:42,454
not on the menu
at Hoagie Haven.

563
00:26:42,506 --> 00:26:45,591
So we went to Costa,
one of the managers at Hoagie Haven,

564
00:26:45,626 --> 00:26:48,127
with pictures of the four female
psych majors living at Cuyler Hall

565
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,512
and asked him if any
were regular customers.

566
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:53,215
He pointed at your picture and said,
"That's my girl Mary."

567
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:56,301
That's a lot of detective work.
That's old school.

568
00:26:56,353 --> 00:26:58,303
I was trying
to impress my boss.

569
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:00,606
- My boss's boss.
- Did it work?

570
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:03,192
He wants you in the studio
along with Jeff.

571
00:27:04,395 --> 00:27:06,145
At the same time.

572
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:11,316
<i>Elliot Hirsch would be moderating,
I guess you'd call it.</i>

573
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,285
It's very promotable.

574
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,370
It'd bring a lot of new
viewers to my show,

575
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:18,790
a lot of younger viewers who
drive a lot of Internet traffic.

576
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:20,576
And I'd score
some points at work.

577
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:22,461
And you're here
for a preinterview.

578
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm here to beg you
not to do it.

579
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:40,095
The travel office transferred
me to talent relations,

580
00:27:40,147 --> 00:27:41,897
who transferred me to Tess,
who said,

581
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:45,400
"It's so romantic that you guys
are on a stakeout together

582
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:47,769
in the Moscow Airport.
You're his destiny."

583
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:51,523
I said, "Tess, we were supposed to
have tickets waiting to Havana."

584
00:27:51,575 --> 00:27:53,358
She said,
"Hang on, let me check."

585
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,911
Then she got back
on the phone and said,

586
00:27:55,946 --> 00:27:58,280
"Did you know there's more
than one city named Havana?"

587
00:27:58,282 --> 00:27:59,615
We have tickets to Spain?

588
00:27:59,617 --> 00:28:02,334
There are layovers in Dvinsk,
Rotterdam, and Berlin.

589
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:04,419
And we change planes in Madrid.
How's it looking here?

590
00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:07,289
There are three people in front of us,
five people in back of us.

591
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:10,008
As passengers come to claim their seats,
the people in back get dismissed.

592
00:28:10,044 --> 00:28:12,678
It's like that last
helicopter out of Saigon.

593
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:14,012
I know how standby works.

594
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:16,131
I was answering your question.

595
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:23,772
It really would have killed
you to apologize to Hallie?

596
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:25,807
You would have gotten
sick and died?

597
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:28,110
As soon as you said
the word romantic...

598
00:28:28,145 --> 00:28:30,028
- I didn't say it, Tess did.
- You recounted it.

599
00:28:30,064 --> 00:28:32,314
I was telling a funny story.

600
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:34,283
As soon as you said romantic,
I knew we were heading for Hallie.

601
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:35,734
After all, it's been two hours.

602
00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:38,453
- You would have tragically died from...
- I did apologize.

603
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:40,239
"I'm sorry I overreacted.

604
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:43,992
In fact, I'm so sorry that I
sent this apology in a text."

605
00:28:44,044 --> 00:28:45,627
How should it have
been delivered?

606
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:48,130
- In person for starters.
- She doesn't want to see me.

607
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:50,332
You know what you should do?

608
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:51,500
Tess thinks you're my destiny?

609
00:28:51,552 --> 00:28:52,801
- Call her right now.
- Tess?

610
00:28:52,836 --> 00:28:54,553
Hallie.
Call her right now.

611
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:56,972
You're halfway around
the world on a big story,

612
00:28:57,007 --> 00:28:58,640
but you just wanted
to hear her voice.

613
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:00,592
Do you want her back, Jim?

614
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:03,095
- Those two are on the plane.
- Do you want her back?

615
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:05,430
- Of course.
- Then do what I'm telling you

616
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,182
and wait for
further instructions.

617
00:29:07,234 --> 00:29:09,518
- Do it.
- You can hold our place?

618
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,987
Yeah, I think I can handle
standing on the ground.

619
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:13,322
'Cause it's not a bad idea.

620
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,274
Don't get into any,
you know, areas.

621
00:29:15,326 --> 00:29:17,693
Just tell her you wanted
to hear her voice

622
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:20,862
and that you love her and that
you'll call her from Cuba.

623
00:29:27,621 --> 00:29:29,871
All right, I'll be right back.

624
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,044
- What happened?
- It was voicemail. I hung up.

625
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,748
- You'll keep trying, right?
- Yeah.

626
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,633
You did good.

627
00:30:20,507 --> 00:30:22,591
I already know what he'll say.

628
00:30:22,593 --> 00:30:24,643
So do I.
I've spoken to him.

629
00:30:24,678 --> 00:30:27,262
- He denied it?
- Yeah.

630
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:29,765
What did he say happened?

631
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,484
You don't want to hear it.

632
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,820
- Yes, I do.
- It's upsetting.

633
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:37,689
I have a new standard
for what upsets me.

634
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:39,441
- He said it was consensual?
- Yeah.

635
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:43,779
How can it be consensual if one of the
consenting parties isn't conscious?

636
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:46,331
- It can't be.
- So what did he say?

637
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:48,834
Mary, he says you said,
"Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.

638
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:50,585
Get two guys in here
who will fuck me."

639
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:52,254
Yeah, that...

640
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:53,955
That sounds like me.

641
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,757
And he's changing
his story a little.

642
00:30:55,793 --> 00:30:57,459
That's something that
would come out in a trial.

643
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:58,627
There's not gonna be a trial.

644
00:30:58,629 --> 00:30:59,928
There's not gonna be an arrest.

645
00:30:59,963 --> 00:31:01,963
And there's not gonna
be an investigation.

646
00:31:02,015 --> 00:31:05,517
Mine's gonna be one of the
700,000 untested rape kits,

647
00:31:05,552 --> 00:31:07,386
so I started this website.

648
00:31:07,438 --> 00:31:10,972
- Do you know who Sloan Sabbith is?
- Sure.

649
00:31:10,974 --> 00:31:13,024
- She's my girlfriend.
- Well done.

650
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,477
About, I don't know,
a year and a half ago,

651
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:18,980
she was dating this guy and they
broke up and he was pissed.

652
00:31:19,032 --> 00:31:20,899
She'd posed for him,
some naked pictures,

653
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:23,151
and he posted them on a site
called RevengePorn.com.

654
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:25,287
I remember.
What did she do?

655
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:27,789
<i>She broke his jaw,
but I'm not recommending that.</i>

656
00:31:27,825 --> 00:31:30,242
This isn't revenge.
It's a warning.

657
00:31:30,294 --> 00:31:32,911
It's a public service.
Do not go on a date with these guys.

658
00:31:32,963 --> 00:31:34,830
<i>Do not go to a party
with these guys.</i>

659
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:36,548
Do not give
these guys a job ever.

660
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,800
Wait, they're avoiding jail and
you think I'm being too harsh?

661
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:41,386
Don't you think there's a chance that
somebody's gonna use the site as revenge?

662
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:44,473
<i>That somebody's gonna make up a
story and ruin a kid's life?</i>

663
00:31:44,508 --> 00:31:46,892
Jeff got into Stanford Medical School.
Not anymore.

664
00:31:46,927 --> 00:31:49,010
There were NFL teams looking at Brandon.
Not anymore.

665
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:50,896
Yeah,
you can imagine how sad that makes me.

666
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:53,265
Don't you think there's a chance that somebody,
a woman who feels rejected...

667
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:54,983
Yeah, bitches be bitches.
I get it.

668
00:31:55,018 --> 00:31:56,518
I'm just saying
that if a grown man

669
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,354
who works in arbitrage at one of
the biggest banks in the world

670
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:01,690
can post naked pictures
of his ex on RevengePorn.com...

671
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:05,243
Yes, I think there's a chance and
I've weighed the cost benefit.

672
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,580
I have. If another girl got raped
because I didn't say anything

673
00:32:08,615 --> 00:32:10,532
or because someone else
didn't say anything...

674
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:12,534
- <i>I know.</i>
- You don't know.

675
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:14,002
And you're right about that,
too.

676
00:32:14,037 --> 00:32:15,921
Then what am I wrong about?

677
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,545
What am I wrong about?

678
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:27,299
I don't like Jews.
I said it.

679
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:29,718
People are afraid to speak
their mind these days.

680
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,803
I haven't noticed that.

681
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:36,558
First of all,
we've got, what, 3%?

682
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,644
- Is that how many Jews there are, 3% of America?
- A little less.

683
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:42,113
Less than 3% of Americans

684
00:32:42,149 --> 00:32:44,866
controlling the banks,
the media, Hollywood.

685
00:32:44,902 --> 00:32:46,902
They didn't take those
things in an armed assault.

686
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:48,820
<i>That's exactly how they did it.</i>

687
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:51,706
<i>Their grandparents came here
from the Polish ghettos</i>

688
00:32:51,742 --> 00:32:53,875
and the Russian villages
and they told their sons,

689
00:32:53,911 --> 00:32:55,660
"Don't work with your hands."

690
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:59,164
Go to law school. You go to medical school.
You go to business school.

691
00:32:59,216 --> 00:33:02,217
You don't get calluses on your hands.
You wear a suit to work.

692
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:04,116
Given the time they came from
and the one that was coming,

693
00:33:04,139 --> 00:33:05,231
it was pretty good advice.

694
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,639
<i>And guys like you worship them.</i>

695
00:33:07,674 --> 00:33:10,425
You'd give anything to be Jewish.
You're Protestant, right?

696
00:33:10,427 --> 00:33:13,144
- Catholic.
- Nah, not on both sides.

697
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,897
- My mother was Catholic.
- So is my wife.

698
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:19,351
- Is that why you hit her?
- No, I'm not prejudiced.

699
00:33:19,403 --> 00:33:21,186
You assume I am
'cause I do real work.

700
00:33:21,238 --> 00:33:23,738
- What do I do?
<i>- Please, buddy.</i>

701
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:26,408
- <i>You want to trade jobs with me?</i>
- No.

702
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:27,943
'Cause you're too smart
for what I do.

703
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:29,244
Just like the Jews.

704
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,280
That's why your father drank.

705
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:37,369
I'm making
an executive decision.

706
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:39,120
Should I quiet everyone down?

707
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:40,922
We can't be in this line because A...
You know,

708
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:43,258
and B... He'll have already talked
to everyone who's boarded.

709
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:44,459
We need to be
on the plane early.

710
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:45,627
Let's go back
to the first plan.

711
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:47,262
No reporter is gonna
sell us their ticket.

712
00:33:47,297 --> 00:33:49,548
There are people on this
flight who aren't reporters.

713
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,433
Let's look around
and identify them.

714
00:33:55,689 --> 00:33:57,889
Those two are on
their honeymoon.

715
00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:07,482
I do, just a little.
My husband does not.

716
00:34:07,534 --> 00:34:09,534
I'm Maggie Jordan
and this is Jim Harper.

717
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,903
We are from an American
news agency.

718
00:34:11,955 --> 00:34:15,240
Atlantis Cable News.

719
00:34:19,663 --> 00:34:23,131
He says Atlantis is a lost...

720
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,550
Hercules, Zeus.

721
00:34:25,586 --> 00:34:28,169
- Mythological.
- Mythological city.

722
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:29,888
It is,
but the news agency is real.

723
00:34:29,923 --> 00:34:31,172
- Go faster.
- Shut up.

724
00:34:31,224 --> 00:34:32,924
Are you on your honeymoon, too?

725
00:34:32,976 --> 00:34:35,644
No,
we're reporting an important story

726
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,646
and we need to get
on that flight.

727
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:39,898
And we'd like to buy
your tickets to Havana

728
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:43,401
and give you two free
tickets to Madrid.

729
00:34:43,437 --> 00:34:46,071
- Tell them Madrid's closer.
- They know where Madrid is.

730
00:34:46,106 --> 00:34:48,323
- Just remind them.
- We know where Madrid is.

731
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:50,575
He wants your watch.

732
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:52,527
He wants your watch.

733
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:55,497
This watch was a graduation
present from my parents.

734
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:57,582
Could I write you a check
for some money instead?

735
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,203
We'll take the money, too.

736
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:08,460
He liked my shirt
and my pants, too.

737
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:10,962
And everything that was in
my suitcase and my suitcase.

738
00:35:11,014 --> 00:35:12,597
Hey, she took my <i>News Night</i>
baseball cap.

739
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:14,883
I think we have more of those.

740
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:16,718
These are our seats.

741
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:23,391
All right.

742
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:25,477
We'll see him
come on from here.

743
00:35:26,947 --> 00:35:30,565
- I look like an idiot.
- You look kind of cute.

744
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:34,035
I look like I...

745
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:37,072
just really, really,
really like the Olympics.

746
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:45,914
You never called Hallie,
did you?

747
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,633
No.

748
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:50,752
Jesus Christ, Jim.

749
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,140
The law is plainly
failing rape victims.

750
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:56,841
That must be obvious to you.

751
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,594
It is, but in fairness,
the law wasn't built to serve victims.

752
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:02,347
- In fairness?
- I know.

753
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:07,268
Do you believe me?

754
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,987
Do I believe you?
Of course I do.

755
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:11,239
- Seriously.
- I'm not here on a fact-finding mission.

756
00:36:11,274 --> 00:36:13,692
I'm just curious.
Be really honest.

757
00:36:13,744 --> 00:36:16,494
Okay.

758
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,446
I've heard two
competing stories.

759
00:36:18,498 --> 00:36:19,914
One from a very credible woman

760
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,033
who as far as I can see
has no reason to lie.

761
00:36:22,085 --> 00:36:24,419
<i>The other from a guy I judge
to be a little sketchy</i>

762
00:36:24,454 --> 00:36:26,621
who has every reason
to lie and I am...

763
00:36:26,623 --> 00:36:28,757
I'm obligated to believe
the sketchy guy.

764
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:31,426
This isn't a courtroom.

765
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:34,012
You're not legally obligated
to presume innocence.

766
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:36,464
- I believe I'm morally obligated.
- You know, you're a good guy,

767
00:36:36,516 --> 00:36:38,600
but do people tell you a lot
that your head's up your ass?

768
00:36:38,635 --> 00:36:41,970
They do,
and I absolutely allow for that possibility.

769
00:36:41,972 --> 00:36:46,474
I'm the guy who goes around saying OJ's
not guilty because a jury said so.

770
00:36:46,526 --> 00:36:48,643
I'm not gonna get a jury.

771
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:50,478
I know,
and I can imagine how frustrating...

772
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,480
No, you can't imagine.

773
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:55,817
No, I can't.

774
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:59,821
But it is a huge, dangerous,

775
00:36:59,823 --> 00:37:03,241
scary-as-shit mistake
to convene your own trial

776
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:06,127
in front of a television audience
where there's no due process,

777
00:37:06,163 --> 00:37:09,080
no lawyers, no discovery,
no rules of procedure,

778
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:12,751
no decisions on admissible evidence,
threat of perjury,

779
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:14,719
confrontation of witnesses
or any of the things we do...

780
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:17,172
To ensure that rapists go
to Stanford Medical School.

781
00:37:17,174 --> 00:37:19,758
To ensure an innocent person
isn't destroyed.

782
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,177
The law can acquit.
The Internet never will.

783
00:37:22,229 --> 00:37:24,846
The Internet is used
for vigilantism every day.

784
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:26,347
But this is a whole new level

785
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:28,183
and if we go there,
we're truly fucked.

786
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:31,603
- I'm not a vigilante.
<i>- Do you want to live in a world where...</i>

787
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:34,522
Do you want to hear
the advice I get?

788
00:37:34,574 --> 00:37:36,357
I mean, this is real advice.

789
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:38,693
In pamphlets.

790
00:37:38,745 --> 00:37:42,580
Say you have a boyfriend.
Wear a wedding ring.

791
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:46,117
I'm supposed to protect
myself from a man

792
00:37:46,169 --> 00:37:49,370
by pretending I'm the
property of another man.

793
00:37:49,372 --> 00:37:52,257
And, of course,
there's no shortage of good fashion advice.

794
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:53,758
- <i>Mary.</i>
- When you came in here,

795
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:55,510
you wanted to go
to a public place

796
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:57,846
because you were scared
I'd cry rape.

797
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:01,683
I'm scared of getting raped.

798
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:05,303
<i>I'm scared all the time.</i>

799
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:09,474
All the time.

800
00:38:09,526 --> 00:38:11,943
So you know what my site does?

801
00:38:13,063 --> 00:38:15,280
It scares you.

802
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:18,199
It scares the living shit
out of any guy

803
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:20,869
who thinks even once
about putting his hands

804
00:38:20,904 --> 00:38:24,155
on someone
without an invitation.

805
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:27,659
You're right to name
your attacker.

806
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:30,211
You may even be obligated to.

807
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,334
But the site is gonna
clobber an innocent person

808
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:38,002
<i>and there is no chance
that it won't.</i>

809
00:38:38,054 --> 00:38:41,639
<i>And if you face off with
the guy you've accused on TV,</i>

810
00:38:41,675 --> 00:38:44,092
it is going to be
a lawless food fight

811
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:46,895
with irreversible,
irretrievable consequences.

812
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,764
Teams will be formed,
you will be slut-shamed,

813
00:38:49,766 --> 00:38:53,101
and you won't get the
justice you're looking for.

814
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:55,770
That's why I'm asking
you to refuse.

815
00:38:57,107 --> 00:38:59,407
I don't understand why
you need me to refuse.

816
00:38:59,442 --> 00:39:01,776
It's your show.
Why don't you just not do it?

817
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:04,863
I've been overruled.
It's a promotable story

818
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:06,164
that'll bring in
a younger audience.

819
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,866
I don't have
a problem with that.

820
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:09,250
It's sports, Mary.

821
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:12,704
<i>It'll be covered like sports.</i>

822
00:39:12,756 --> 00:39:14,839
I'm gonna win this time.

823
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,213
All right.

824
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Thanks for hearing me out.

825
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,804
<i>We'll be in touch with you.</i>

826
00:39:38,782 --> 00:39:42,150
<i>- You miss your wife?</i>
- Yes.

827
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:44,819
Uh, yes.
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

828
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:46,321
<i>I miss my wife.
That's affirmative.</i>

829
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:48,122
I was married to her
for 11 minutes

830
00:39:48,158 --> 00:39:51,876
before I was taken to jail.
Yes, I miss my wife.

831
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:55,296
So is she like you or is she like,
I don't know, what do you call it?

832
00:39:55,332 --> 00:39:57,665
- I don't know what you're asking.
- A trophy wife.

833
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:00,051
A guy like you could get,
you know.

834
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:02,003
Is she a trophy wife
or is she smart?

835
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:04,422
She's very smart.

836
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:07,225
<i>Is that something you're saying
because people say that?</i>

837
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,560
She went to school
at Cambridge in England.

838
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:12,180
She's considered one of the
best in the world at her job...

839
00:40:12,232 --> 00:40:14,983
- You've got to stop being a prick.
- What did I do now?

840
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:18,019
I know that Cambridge is in goddamn England,
shithead.

841
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:20,488
<i>Why is the first thing you tell
me is where she went to school?</i>

842
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:23,358
My wife is smarter than I
am in every way imaginable

843
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,909
and it never makes me mad.

844
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:27,578
I don't feel a crippling
inferiority complex

845
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:29,914
turn into rage
and bad decisions

846
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,582
when I think about
her being smart.

847
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:34,369
- You're saying I do?
<i>- It seems to come up a lot.</i>

848
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:36,037
I don't like media types.

849
00:40:36,122 --> 00:40:37,956
- East Coast elites.
- Yeah.

850
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,707
That's a thoroughly
original opinion.

851
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:41,926
<i>I've never heard that before.</i>

852
00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:46,097
See, you people think
we can't recognize sarcasm.

853
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:48,766
We can.
We just call it being an asshole.

854
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:50,551
And we call you a shit kicker.

855
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:52,804
And you still don't think you
look down at some people.

856
00:40:52,856 --> 00:40:54,055
Down is where some people are.

857
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:56,224
Hmm.

858
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:01,779
What's your mission
to civilize?

859
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:04,615
Who told you about that?

860
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:06,200
- <i>You did.</i>
- When?

861
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:08,569
- A while ago.
- I don't remember that.

862
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:10,955
<i>Mission to civilize,
what is that?</i>

863
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:12,407
Nothing.

864
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:14,459
- <i>It's not nothing.</i>
- It's just a joke.

865
00:41:14,494 --> 00:41:16,044
- <i>No, it's not.</i>
- It's nothing.

866
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,463
<i>What is it?</i>

867
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:21,249
It's a reference
to Don Quixote.

868
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:22,917
- The knight?
- He wasn't a real knight.

869
00:41:22,969 --> 00:41:25,670
He was an old man who was delusional.
He thought he was a knight.

870
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:28,923
He took on a world that was
bleak and morally corrupt.

871
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,427
How'd he do?

872
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,429
He got his ass kicked.

873
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:38,983
See?
And that's the thing.

874
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:42,103
I don't want to see you
get your ass kicked.

875
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:49,911
That's... That's not true.
That was dishonest.

876
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:53,698
I badly want to see you
get your ass kicked.

877
00:41:54,455 --> 00:41:56,334
I know.

878
00:41:58,121 --> 00:42:00,705
And that picture
of you and your father,

879
00:42:00,757 --> 00:42:04,125
I'll bet he wasn't trying to
teach you about civic morality.

880
00:42:04,177 --> 00:42:08,379
I'll bet he was just trying
to teach you to fish.

881
00:42:15,055 --> 00:42:17,355
Please,
you have to take your seats now.

882
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,357
<i>We're pushing back from the
gate and all passengers</i>

883
00:42:19,392 --> 00:42:23,061
must take their seats, please.
Thank you.

884
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,648
We had seats across
the aisle from him.

885
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,953
The honeymooners had two seats across
the aisle from Edward Snowden.

886
00:42:31,988 --> 00:42:35,039
Boris and Natasha
had the golden tickets.

887
00:42:35,075 --> 00:42:37,125
We'd have had him the whole
flight except for one thing.

888
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,460
- He's not...
- He's not on the plane. You know where he is?

889
00:42:39,496 --> 00:42:42,080
- Probably back in the airport.
- Yeah.

890
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:46,167
So we'll be flying 600 miles
an hour away from the story.

891
00:42:47,337 --> 00:42:49,887
Fuck!

892
00:42:53,393 --> 00:42:55,760
Why didn't you call her?

893
00:42:55,812 --> 00:42:57,478
What?

894
00:42:57,514 --> 00:42:59,730
Why didn't you call Hallie?

895
00:42:59,766 --> 00:43:01,516
You're a noodge, Maggie.
You know that?

896
00:43:01,568 --> 00:43:04,435
I'm just asking.

897
00:43:04,487 --> 00:43:07,155
If you really like her,
it's a stupid thing...

898
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,323
I like you.

899
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,327
And I don't really know
why you don't know that.

900
00:43:19,285 --> 00:43:20,701
Because...

901
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,921
Because if you wanted to be with me,
you'd be with me.

902
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:26,174
That's just not at all true.

903
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:29,043
You were with Don
when I met you.

904
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:31,045
You never called me
from New Hampshire.

905
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:34,048
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't. Ever.

906
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,435
And you knew I had split up
with Don and you knew why.

907
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,470
You went through Lisa,
you went through Hallie.

908
00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:41,722
And you never called me
from New Hampshire.

909
00:43:41,774 --> 00:43:44,058
So it's really not as
obvious as you think it is.

910
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,643
And it's also
probably not true.

911
00:43:45,695 --> 00:43:48,062
Well,
the rest might be right...

912
00:43:49,399 --> 00:43:51,899
It's not,
but it had potential...

913
00:43:51,951 --> 00:43:54,902
but the last thing
was unambiguously wrong.

914
00:43:54,954 --> 00:43:57,572
- What language are you...
- I do like you.

915
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:01,826
I like you
and I'm glad I said it.

916
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:04,912
Even though now I wish
I had said it

917
00:44:04,964 --> 00:44:07,081
at the end
of a 13-hour flight.

918
00:44:10,753 --> 00:44:12,970
Yeah,
this is gonna be uncomfortable.

919
00:44:13,006 --> 00:44:14,422
I'm gonna switch seats
with someone.

920
00:44:14,474 --> 00:44:16,841
I'll switch seats.
I'll sit in Snowden's seat.

921
00:44:16,893 --> 00:44:18,009
That's not far enough.

922
00:44:18,061 --> 00:44:20,478
It's gonna be weird
if we can see each other.

923
00:44:26,152 --> 00:44:28,019
Okay.

924
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:52,877
I'm making a motion
that the court

925
00:44:52,929 --> 00:44:54,845
vacate its initial
contempt finding

926
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:56,547
because enough is enough.

927
00:44:56,633 --> 00:44:58,132
<i>Do I need grounds?
Sure.</i>

928
00:44:58,134 --> 00:44:59,433
<i>The government
now possesses information</i>

929
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,686
that will help it independently
find the source.

930
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:03,521
But mostly, enough is enough.

931
00:45:03,556 --> 00:45:05,439
You can't lock up
a man for 52 days

932
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:07,892
without him knowing when or
even if he's ever getting out.

933
00:45:07,944 --> 00:45:11,312
You can't lock up a reporter
for protecting his source.

934
00:45:11,397 --> 00:45:13,648
- You can't have everything. And you...
- Rebecca.

935
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:14,815
I have not yielded the floor.

936
00:45:14,817 --> 00:45:16,901
I won't be contesting
your motion.

937
00:45:16,953 --> 00:45:18,986
I'm sorry?

938
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:22,957
I won't be contesting your motion.
I'll be joining it.

939
00:45:22,992 --> 00:45:25,826
This isn't supposed to be punitive.
It's supposed to be coercive.

940
00:45:25,828 --> 00:45:28,996
And plainly he's not
giving up the name.

941
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:30,998
He'll sleep at home tonight.

942
00:45:42,512 --> 00:45:43,928
Follow me.

943
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:48,182
Follow me.

944
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,986
<i>Where are we going?</i>

945
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:54,021
Exactly where
you think we're going.

946
00:45:54,073 --> 00:45:56,073
I don't know what...
I'm confused.

947
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:59,160
We're running into turbulence.

948
00:45:59,195 --> 00:46:02,029
You have to go to your seats
and put your seat belts on.

949
00:46:02,031 --> 00:46:03,581
This is awkward.

950
00:46:03,616 --> 00:46:06,417
I was sitting far away from you.
I was watching episode four.

951
00:46:06,452 --> 00:46:08,369
I'm sorry,
would you mind trading back?

952
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:10,338
We're in the middle
of turbulence.

953
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:12,089
It's nothing.
It's due to the action

954
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:14,759
of molecular viscosity
called laminar flow.

955
00:46:16,095 --> 00:46:18,713
Okay.

956
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:21,382
- Where did that come from?
- Sit down. Put on your seat belt.

957
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:00,755
And we're joined now by Bree Dorrit,
editor of ACN Digital

958
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:02,306
and father of the ACNgage app.

959
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:04,091
- Thanks for joining us, Bree.
- Hi, Sloan.

960
00:47:04,093 --> 00:47:07,511
<i>We saw some of it in the package we just played,
but tell us about ACNgage.</i>

961
00:47:07,563 --> 00:47:09,096
<i>It's a map that tells you
where celebrities</i>

962
00:47:09,148 --> 00:47:10,765
<i>have been sighted in
New York or Los Angeles.</i>

963
00:47:10,767 --> 00:47:13,351
<i>And soon we'll be expanding
to Vegas and South Beach.</i>

964
00:47:13,403 --> 00:47:16,237
Any time you want,
you can scroll around and see, you know,

965
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:19,273
Jude Law was shopping for condoms
at Duane Reade on 57th or...

966
00:47:19,325 --> 00:47:22,326
So people are out there and they
can post a message to us and say,

967
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:24,779
"Kristen Bell and her kid
are at the 4:00 PM showing

968
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:26,614
of <i>How to Train Your Dragon</i>
at the ArcLight"?

969
00:47:26,616 --> 00:47:28,416
And it goes right on
our map instantly.

970
00:47:28,451 --> 00:47:30,034
So that when Kristen Bell and
her kid come out of the movies,

971
00:47:30,086 --> 00:47:32,119
there are a dozen sociopaths
waiting for them?

972
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:37,792
- I don't think that's likely.
- Why not?

973
00:47:37,794 --> 00:47:40,177
Well, it's the price of fame,
isn't it?

974
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:42,129
<i>No, it's not.
It's a punishment for it.</i>

975
00:47:42,181 --> 00:47:44,849
<i>Celebrities have been stalked and
celebrities have been murdered.</i>

976
00:47:44,934 --> 00:47:47,385
What this app is best at
is assisting in that, right?

977
00:47:47,437 --> 00:47:48,853
I'm sorry you feel that way.

978
00:47:48,888 --> 00:47:50,805
ACNgage is citizen journalism.

979
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:52,473
Can you talk about
the vetting process

980
00:47:52,525 --> 00:47:54,642
- the citizen journalism undergoes?
- The vetting?

981
00:47:54,644 --> 00:47:56,694
<i>People can post
more than locations.</i>

982
00:47:56,729 --> 00:47:58,312
- <i>They can post observations.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

983
00:47:58,364 --> 00:48:00,948
<i>I'm asking if those posts
are fact-checked.</i>

984
00:48:00,983 --> 00:48:02,817
<i>This is one specific
element of the site...</i>

985
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:05,369
<i>For instance,
in a post today a citizen journalist tells us</i>

986
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:07,655
that Jimmy Kimmel was visibly
intoxicated last night

987
00:48:07,657 --> 00:48:09,957
- at the Soho House in West Hollywood.
- That's right.

988
00:48:09,992 --> 00:48:13,043
Jimmy Kimmel was with his family
in Cabo San Lucas last night.

989
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,465
People don't read this with the
expectation of it being true.

990
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,999
- Everyone...
- Excuse me?

991
00:48:19,051 --> 00:48:20,751
- Everyone...
- People don't have an expectation

992
00:48:20,803 --> 00:48:22,052
that what they're
reading is true?

993
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:24,004
<i>They read it for the immediacy.</i>

994
00:48:24,006 --> 00:48:25,589
<i>But you're using
the word journalism,</i>

995
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:28,309
which means there is an expectation
that what they're reading is true.

996
00:48:28,344 --> 00:48:29,894
But let me take it
a step further.

997
00:48:29,929 --> 00:48:31,762
Let's pretend it was true
that Jimmy Kimmel

998
00:48:31,814 --> 00:48:34,515
<i>was intoxicated last night at the
Soho House in West Hollywood.</i>

999
00:48:34,567 --> 00:48:36,517
<i>It's not true, but we don't care,
so let's pretend</i>

1000
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:38,018
<i>that it is since that's
what we're doing anyway.</i>

1001
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,603
<i>Why does that belong
on our website?</i>

1002
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:41,322
Leave her on
as long as she wants.

1003
00:48:41,357 --> 00:48:43,858
Honestly,
I think there's a shifting definition

1004
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,576
of what's public
and private space.

1005
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:46,994
There is,
and we should care about that.

1006
00:48:47,029 --> 00:48:49,029
But my question is
why should we care

1007
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:51,248
about a talk show host
drinking at a bar?

1008
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:53,918
Don't you think it's great
that we're not putting people

1009
00:48:53,953 --> 00:48:55,703
up on a pedestal and
worshipping them anymore?

1010
00:48:55,755 --> 00:48:59,206
I don't think celebrities are one
of the bigger problems facing us,

1011
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:01,258
but aren't we the ones
building the pedestal?

1012
00:49:01,294 --> 00:49:03,344
You've got a map that
gives us their location.

1013
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:05,679
The idea is that we're acknowledging
that they're real people.

1014
00:49:05,715 --> 00:49:08,048
I wonder how many of us
didn't already know that.

1015
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,717
But you're doing more than
acknowledging they're real people.

1016
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:11,519
You're beating them up for it.

1017
00:49:11,554 --> 00:49:14,638
Aren't they protected by the piles
of money they're surrounded by?

1018
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,774
Okay,
what's the line of demarcation?

1019
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:19,977
You make over X dollars a year and
now you get to be treated by us

1020
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:21,946
as a regular person
who's basically had

1021
00:49:21,981 --> 00:49:24,365
an electronic bracelet slapped on their ankle.
What does X equal?

1022
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,901
It would be silly to name
an exact dollar amount.

1023
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:29,787
- You're paid $55,000 a year.
- Well, that's private.

1024
00:49:29,822 --> 00:49:33,574
Sorry. That's almost twice the
national average for a family of four.

1025
00:49:33,626 --> 00:49:35,993
Do your piles of cash protect
you from this interview

1026
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:38,078
in which I'm intentionally
stripping you of your dignity?

1027
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,998
And, by the way,
I've managed to do it without lying once.

1028
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:43,834
So I'm going to give you another
chance to answer my question

1029
00:49:43,886 --> 00:49:45,419
before I answer it myself.

1030
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,004
What's the value
of an unsourced,

1031
00:49:47,056 --> 00:49:51,091
unvetted story about a grown
man drinking at a bar?

1032
00:49:55,898 --> 00:49:58,766
I can't give you all the time in the world.
It's entertainment.

1033
00:49:58,851 --> 00:50:00,434
My concern isn't
for the celebrities,

1034
00:50:00,436 --> 00:50:03,521
even though as sure as we're sitting here,
someone's gonna get hurt.

1035
00:50:03,573 --> 00:50:04,989
My concern is for
the rest of us

1036
00:50:05,024 --> 00:50:07,858
who you're turning into a
wild pack of prideless punks.

1037
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:10,694
That's <i>News Night</i> for June 24.

1038
00:50:10,746 --> 00:50:12,780
I'm Sloan Sabbith
filling in for Will McAvoy.

1039
00:50:12,832 --> 00:50:15,616
<i>Terry Smith's up next

<i>We're clear.</i>

1041

Pruit's gonna
kill you for this.

1042
00:50:24,126 --> 00:50:25,926
I know.

1043
00:50:31,017 --> 00:50:33,634
- Did you put her up to that?!
- Let's go in my office.

1044
00:50:33,636 --> 00:50:37,021
- No! We'll go where I fucking say we go!
- Charlie.

1045
00:50:37,056 --> 00:50:39,223
- Did you put her up to it?
- Nobody put me up to anything.

1046
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:41,141
What did you think
you were doing?

1047
00:50:41,193 --> 00:50:43,277
- You saw the questions she was gonna ask?
- 'Course I saw the questions.

1048
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:44,979
I was doing the interview the
only way that made sense to me.

1049
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:46,530
You were openly insubordinate!

1050
00:50:46,566 --> 00:50:48,148
I was told to do
this interview.

1051
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,650
You knew what
I was looking for!

1052
00:50:49,702 --> 00:50:51,735
I did and I didn't like it,
but I did it anyway.

1053
00:50:51,787 --> 00:50:54,405
- That was my interview. Mac wasn't responsible.
- I tried to do the best I could, but I didn't...

1054
00:50:54,457 --> 00:50:55,906
I'm tired of this.

1055
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:57,791
Did you get the Princeton kid?

1056
00:50:57,827 --> 00:51:00,327
Charlie, let's go into my office
and sit down for a minute.

1057
00:51:00,379 --> 00:51:01,745
Did you get the Princeton kid?

1058
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,717
- No.
- Why not?

1059
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,887
Couldn't find her.

1060
00:51:11,173 --> 00:51:13,424
You couldn't...

1061
00:51:13,476 --> 00:51:14,975
No.

1062
00:51:15,011 --> 00:51:18,012
- You couldn't find her?!
- No.

1063
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:19,980
Is this a mutiny?!

1064
00:51:20,016 --> 00:51:21,482
It's an intervention.

1065
00:51:21,517 --> 00:51:23,851
I'm trying to keep
this together!

1066
00:51:23,903 --> 00:51:26,654
Her and her,
tell 'em to pack their shit and get out of here.

1067
00:51:26,689 --> 00:51:28,572
- I apologize for the interview.
- I don't.

1068
00:51:28,608 --> 00:51:30,658
- Pack up your shit and get out of here, lady.
- Look...

1069
00:51:30,693 --> 00:51:33,494
She tore apart our network,
except it isn't ours, it's mine.

1070
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:36,363
So either Thelma and Louise vacate the
premises in the next five minutes

1071
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:40,000
or I will fire the motherfucking
lot of you right now.

1072
00:51:40,036 --> 00:51:42,336
No, you won't.
'Cause you can't.

1073
00:51:42,371 --> 00:51:46,590
Only I can.
A parting gift from Mrs. Lansing.

1074
00:51:46,626 --> 00:51:49,710
Who on her worst day
would never...

1075
00:51:52,848 --> 00:51:55,099
We need to talk.

1076
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:56,934
You and me, right now, okay?

1077
00:51:58,354 --> 00:52:00,354
Upstairs.

1078
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:03,023
Nobody leaves the premises
until we figure out

1079
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:05,442
how to fix
this fucking calamity.

1080
00:52:06,896 --> 00:52:09,279
I'll be back in a minute.

1081
00:52:11,734 --> 00:52:13,734
- Let's meet in my office.
- I'm there.

1082
00:54:13,194 --> 00:54:16,705

1083
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:21,195
It's okay.
It's over.

1084
00:54:28,671 --> 00:54:31,755
Charlie had a heart
attack a few hours ago.

1085
00:54:34,877 --> 00:54:36,844
He died.
