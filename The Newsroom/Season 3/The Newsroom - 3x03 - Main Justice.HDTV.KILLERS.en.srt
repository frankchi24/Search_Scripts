What the fuck is going on?

14
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:47,374
- They're taking our hard drives.
- Is it Neal's story?

15
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:49,043
<i>They've got a warrant
to search the hard drives.</i>

16
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:50,594
- Is this for real?
- What's your name?

17
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:52,046
- My name?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:54,214
It's spelled arrest me
or go fuck yourself.

19
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:57,217
- We've been raided.
- It's Saturday night and you got the graveyard shift.

20
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,520
What would I find if I stop and frisk you,
Snoop Dogg?

21
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:01,555
Unless that warrant says you can
stick your hand in my pockets,

22
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:04,892
you're gonna find yourself in a conversation
about illegal search and seizure.

23
00:02:04,894 --> 00:02:08,062
All right, back off.
Everybody just cooperate.

24
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,699
- My password's N-Y...
- I don't need your password.

25
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:15,536
- That's a comfort.
- Please stand away from your desk.

26
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,488
Do you know where
Neal Sampat is?

27
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:19,323
What are my rights
in this situation?

28
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:22,409
You don't answer and you don't get
to keep asking that question.

29
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:25,079
Actually, she does,
but nobody has to answer.

30
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,664
So just turn down
the temperature a litt...

31
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,415
- This is a fucking outrage, Molly.
- Okay.

32
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,250
And this is a fucking warrant
from a federal court, Mac.

33
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:33,253
And we are the physical manifestation
of the will of that court.

34
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:35,222
The fuck are you,
Marley's ghost?

35
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,890
You kiss your sources
with that mouth?

36
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:38,642
Don, please stay where you are.

37
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:40,728
I'd like to make sure my
phones aren't being tapped.

38
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:42,096
They don't have permission
to tap our phones.

39
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:43,764
Then I guess this
would be the first time

40
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,399
the FBI has used
a warrantless wiretap.

41
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:47,067
Can I save you guys some time?

42
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,819
Neal is a smart guy and there's
no way he left a trail

43
00:02:48,853 --> 00:02:51,271
<i>to a government source on something
that can be seized by the government.</i>

<i>Sloan I've got privileged stock
information on my computer.</i>

45
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:54,858

00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,827
<i>They're just doing their jobs.</i>

47
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,862
And I'm doing mine.

48
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:01,165
<i>Charlie.</i>

49
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,418
It's Charlie Skinner.
Give me LA control, please.

50
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:06,787
<i>Please put the phone down,
Mr. Skinner.</i>

51
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,706
Don, Jim,
power up our control room.

52
00:03:08,757 --> 00:03:11,425
- Yeah.
- Gary, grab a camera.

53
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,794
- Can you get me wired?
- Guys!

54
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:15,512
It's Charlie in New York.

55
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:18,132
We're gonna be breaking
in live in three minutes.

56
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,855
Do you have the first idea how
any of this equipment works?

57
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,690
I don't know how electricity works.
Just start pressing buttons.

58
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:28,192
We don't know how
to broadcast anything.

59
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:29,810
Charlie was on the phone
with Domino's Pizza.

60
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,061
We're not broadcasting
anything.

61
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:32,780
Just get an in-house feed
up on the monitors.

62
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:38,118
Don't make things
harder on yourselves.

63
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:39,987
I think I'm making
things harder for you.

64
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:42,656
Come on, Mac. We've been friends forever.
I'm coming to your wedding.

65
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:45,209
Well, I haven't gotten your RSVP yet,
Molly.

66
00:03:45,243 --> 00:03:46,960
So how'd you like
your name chyroned?

67
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:48,379
This is now out of control.

68
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,714
It's not hard to promptly RSVP.

69
00:03:50,749 --> 00:03:53,333
- It's a common courtesy.
- 90 seconds.

70
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,003
They're bluffing.

71
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,808
Hook me up, quick.

72
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:06,730
Come on, guys.
Find some lights.

73
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:10,934
See, I don't think there's
gonna be an on-off switch.

74
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:15,522
- Check it out.
- What did you press?

75
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:17,991
It's an on-off switch.

76
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:19,359
What is on our air?

77
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:21,395
<i>Red Carpet Roundup</i>.
We need a studio feed.

78
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,697
Can I just say that this network's
Saturday night programming is...

79
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:26,200
- Maybe now's not the time. But I do agree.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

80
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:28,419
How have neither of you
in all this time

81
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:30,587
absorbed any of
the technology involved

82
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:33,090
with broadcasting the news you,
you know, do?

83
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:35,175
Well, I can't speak for Don,
but my experience is...

84
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,810
Shut up.

85
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:48,138
Do we have sound?
Can anybody hear me?

86
00:04:50,475 --> 00:04:53,060
We're gonna need your first
name for the banner.

87
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:54,511
Is it Kip?

88
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:56,814
Your lack of cooperation
will be noted for our report.

89
00:04:56,865 --> 00:04:58,565
I hope that doesn't
leak to the press.

90
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:01,034
- Oh, I'm gonna make sure it does.
- I'm being cooperative.

91
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:03,403
Can it be noted that some of
us are being downright docile?

92
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,206
- So it's Kip?
- Rodger with a D.

93
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:09,376
- We're gonna misspell it.
- $210 a plate, Molly.

94
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,628
It's nice to have a head count.
He's not made of money.

95
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:13,413
I do fine.
We can afford it.

96
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:16,083
<i>- We're up.</i>
<i>- That's nice, Gary.</i>

97
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:18,669
Yeah, start on the windbreakers

98
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,587
<i>and then come over and frame up</i>

99
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,806
<i>Special Agent Levy
for the hero shot.</i>

100
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:28,428
There's a typo.
You left out the R.

101
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,647
- Where?
- It says "beaking news."

102
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:34,017
Calm down.
Can she hear you on the IFB?

103
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,404
No. Please, please,
pretend you can hear me.

104
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,323
- Copy, I can hear you.
- She did it!

105
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:42,326
- She felt my vibe.
- I think she can really hear you.

106
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,911
- It says "baking news" now.
- Fuck!

107
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:47,030
- 15 seconds.
- Good talking to you, Molly.

108
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:50,167
You and your men continue your
government raid of an American newsroom.

109
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:53,086
I'm gonna go executive
produce a special report.

110
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,205
Stand them down.

111
00:06:05,049 --> 00:06:07,134
Stand down.

112
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,389
Everybody stand down.

113
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,947
LA control, keep your air.

114
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:30,374
They're stopping!
Shh.

115
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,160
We did it.

116
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:36,380
Freedom won and not
a bullet was fired.

117
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:38,048
Let this day
be recorded in the all...

118
00:06:38,082 --> 00:06:40,000
Your fly is unzipped.

119
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:45,472
I'm not sure how I feel
about new confident Maggie.

120
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:47,507
She's looking good.

121
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,676
<i>I can still hear you.</i>

122
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:52,563
Do you think there's
any chance she's...

123
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:54,598
<i>I'm not pretending.</i>

124
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:05,859
Seems like lately a lot of people have
been playing fast and loose with the law.

125
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,911
I didn't break any laws.

126
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:10,697
It was a solid warrant and they had
a solid reason for seeking it.

127
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:12,449
I'm not at all convinced
we're the good guys.

128
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,501
- Where was he supposed to go?
- The source?

129
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,587
Where was he supposed to go?
The police?

130
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:19,506
He's not supposed to go anywhere
with classified information.

131
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,209
That was the Assistant
Attorney General,

132
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,677
the US Attorney
for the Southern District,

133
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:25,596
and the Deputy Director
of the FBI on the phone.

134
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,214
And?

135
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:31,184
We've negotiated
a one-week ceasefire.

136
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:34,137
Friday night we'll all meet
up at Main Justice in DC

137
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,973
<i>and try to dig our way
out of this.</i>

138
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:37,774
I'm not holding
this story for a week.

139
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:40,060
- Holding the story for a week isn't a problem.
- It's a problem for me.

140
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,729
Doesn't it take at least a
week to vet 27,000 documents?

141
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,232
If you put the same scrupulous
attention into vetting this story

142
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:47,150
as you did with Genoa,
you should be done in no time.

143
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:49,069
You are sitting
at the loser table.

144
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,155
- At your wedding, what else is available?
- There goes your plus one.

145
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,957
All right, look,
what I need is an assurance

146
00:07:53,992 --> 00:07:55,876
that it's safe for Neal
to come out of the dark.

147
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,328
The government is not going to
make a move on either of you

148
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,580
until Friday,
and then hopefully never.

149
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:02,983
- They're still walking out of here with...
- Shh, shh, shh.

150
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:05,252
Agents Levy, Hutchinson,
thank you very much.

151
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:07,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

152
00:08:08,606 --> 00:08:10,857
You're getting the fish
and the fish is gonna suck!

153
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:12,442
You're talking about
your own wedding.

154
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:14,511
- She's got a point.
- Where's Neal?

155
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,896
- I don't know.
- Come on.

156
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,231
- I don't know where he is.
- Good.

157
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:21,101
- You did something right.
- He's safe.

158
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:24,521
What?

159
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:28,075
He's safe.
That's all I know.

160
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:29,860
And don't ask me about it again,
okay?

161
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,411
Yeah.

162
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:33,613
Can I speak with you?

163
00:08:33,615 --> 00:08:36,166
I'm not sure I like
the deal you just made.

164
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,669
I don't care.
How do you know he's safe?

165
00:08:38,703 --> 00:08:40,787
It's a premonition.

166
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:42,539
Did you...
Fucking hell.

167
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,207
- Did you tell him where to go?
- No.

168
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:47,461
- Did you give him money? A bus ticket?
- No.

169
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:53,300
What happens Friday night?

170
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,435
The investigators are
gonna ask you and Neal

171
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,221
<i>to tell them everything you can
without revealing the source.</i>

172
00:08:58,272 --> 00:09:01,692
If they can connect the dots without
the identity of the source, great.

173
00:09:01,726 --> 00:09:03,477
If they can't?

174
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:06,813
I don't know a district court
judge who's ever let a reporter

175
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:09,483
keep his source when national
security was involved.

176
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,651
And who decides if national
security is involved?

177
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:13,320
- The judge.
- You see my problem?

178
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:14,821
The judge is the one
who's supposed to decide,

179
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:16,990
not Matthew Broderick in <i>WarGames</i>,
not Neal, and not me.

180
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:19,042
<i>- That's a prosecutor talking.</i>
<i>- Yes, it is.</i>

181
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,877
And how are we supposed
to be in DC Friday night?

182
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:23,880
- We do the news here at 8:00.
- The meeting's at midnight.

183
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:26,066
All right,
obviously we'll talk more before then.

184
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,503
But for now just go drink... Home.
Just go home.

185
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:33,473
That stunt with the cameras,
that wasn't cool.

186
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:34,975
Neither am I.

187
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:38,061
All right.

188
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:40,680
We give them
everything they want,

189
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,983
and in exchange we get
to not go to jail?

190
00:09:43,017 --> 00:09:44,735
We also get to run the story.

191
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:46,937
<i>We get the guidance
we need to run the story</i>

192
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:51,024
without risking national
security or anyone's life.

193
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:53,160
Good night.

194
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:55,695
I'm only going to ask you once.

195
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,835
Do you really know
the identity of the source?

196
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,754
- Yes.
- That was stupid.

197
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:05,255
That was something I would do.

198
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,290
They're not gonna lock me up.
I'm too big to jail.

199
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,877
Until about half an hour ago,
I thought they wouldn't raid a newsroom.

200
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:12,879
They've got his hard drive
now and if there's anything

201
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,464
on there that shows
he's aided and abetted,

202
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:17,934
then you and Neal are in two
very different situations.

203
00:10:17,969 --> 00:10:19,886
He used an air-gapped computer,
remember?

204
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:21,772
- And where is he?
- I don't know.

205
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:24,357
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

206
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:30,614
You know,
since it's not possible

207
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:33,066
for everyone to like you,
I really think...

208
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:35,068
I wasn't trying to get
the FBI to like me.

209
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,736
They just happen to be
the only ones in the room

210
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:38,455
authorized to do
what they're doing.

211
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,323
Why do we have a loser table?

212
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,210
- Your friends.
- All right.

213
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:16,610
Hi. I have here
an EPA report that's been...

214
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:18,995
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,948
I have here an EPA report
that's been embargoed.

216
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,284
- How did you get it?
- It doesn't matter.

217
00:11:24,286 --> 00:11:27,370
The Scripps Institution
of Oceanography in San Diego

218
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,256
measured the levels
of carbon dioxide

219
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,091
atop Mauna Loa,
a volcano in Hawaii,

220
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,793
and found that it's passed
a long-feared milestone,

221
00:11:33,845 --> 00:11:35,929
400 parts per million,
which is a concentration

222
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:38,632
not seen on Earth
in millions of years.

223
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:40,100
Here's what happened.

224
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,718
You started talking
about CO2 levels

225
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,304
and I started thinking about
other things in my head.

226
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:47,691
CO2 is a gas.

227
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:50,310
The Scripps Institution
of Oceanography,

228
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:52,145
which is made up
of professional scientists,

229
00:11:52,147 --> 00:11:54,648
measured the level of CO2
in the air and found...

230
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:57,484
The Mets need speed. The Mets need power.
The Mets need pitching.

231
00:11:57,486 --> 00:11:59,202
That's what I'm thinking
about right now.

232
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:04,324
Living things need oxygen
to stay alive.

233
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,792
- I want a hot dog right now.
- Look...

234
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:06,993
Have you come to me for help?

235
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:08,795
- Have I...
<i>- Come to me for help?</i>

236
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,130
- No.
- What can I do for you?

237
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,498
I'd like some advice.

238
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:13,166
What's another word for advice?

239
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:15,502
- Look...
- You showed a lot of wisdom coming to me for help.

240
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:16,836
- I don't need help.
- Great.

241
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:18,922
- I need help.
- Hit me.

242
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,259
Yeah,
I think you know what I meant.

243
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,393
Yeah, I think I did.

244
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:25,512
This is an embargoed
EPA report.

245
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,180
- How'd you get it?
- Doesn't matter.

246
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:29,683
The last time the levels were this
high was three million years ago.

247
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,935
- We survived it then, right?
- No, there were no humans.

248
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,320
It wiped out all the humans?

249
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:35,322
There were no humans before,
you moron.

250
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:37,524
Talking like that is no way
to get me to help you.

251
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:39,859
The last time the CO2
level was this high,

252
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:42,696
the climate was far warmer,
the ice caps were smaller,

253
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:44,447
the sea levels
60-80 feet higher.

254
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,499
Scientists believe
that humanity

255
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:49,119
is precipitating a return to those conditions,
only this time...

256
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,121
- Billions of people are in harm's way.
- Yes.

257
00:12:51,172 --> 00:12:54,007
I would take any one of the three...
Speed, power, or pitching.

258
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,343
And this is my problem.

259
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:58,261
- That environmental stories aren't exciting?
- Right.

260
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,347
I've been doing a dramatic
rendering of that problem.

261
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:03,016
This report says the world
is coming to an end.

262
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,052
I am preparing an interview
for Will to conduct on Friday

263
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:08,722
with the the Deputy Assistant
Administrator of the EPA.

264
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:10,974
On Friday when everybody
watches the news.

265
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,976
Mac's put it in the B block.

266
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:15,195
When I asked her what story

267
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,280
she felt was going to trump
the end of the world,

268
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:19,899
she said, "I don't know,
but I'm sure something will come up."

269
00:13:19,951 --> 00:13:22,202
So you want this to feel more
like a Jim Harper segment

270
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,738
and less like
a Maggie Jordan segment?

271
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:26,239
Just say yes.

272
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,241
- Yes.
- Have you marked this up?

273
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,076
Yeah.

274
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:44,674
There's nothing
unimportant in there.

275
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:46,259
Then what was the point
of highlighting it?

276
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,011
To amplify its importance.

277
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:50,480
And how much time do we have to tell our
audience about the end of the world?

278
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:52,932
- Four minutes and 10 seconds.
- Who's the interview with?

279
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:55,185
The Deputy Assistant
Administrator of the EPA.

280
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:56,403
We can't get
the head of the EPA?

281
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:57,821
There is no head of the EPA.

282
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:59,406
Tell me when you're done
reading the report

283
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,074
- so I can explain it to you.
- I'll be able to understand it.

284
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,159
- Without Neal here to help?
- I know how to use a dictionary.

285
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:04,444
Without Neal here to show you?

286
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:05,945
Looking forward
to working with you.

287
00:14:05,997 --> 00:14:07,747
I'm dreading it.
Have a good day.

288
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,784
How'd you get the report?

289
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:14,287
Ahem, CO2 means two parts of oxygen
for every one part of carbon.

290
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:18,291
I know that.
Wait... Yeah, I know that.

291
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,629
<i>- Yeah, I'll let him know.
- Thanks.</i>

292
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,465
Ahem.

293
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,053
Reese and Mrs. Lansing are on
their way down to see you.

294
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:32,939
- They're coming down here?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

295
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,475
You sure they didn't
want me to come up there?

296
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,610
No, they're on their way.

297
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,114
Everyone knows
something's going on.

298
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,899
We just don't know what.

299
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,868
Yeah, I know.

300
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,821
Just show them in
when they get here.

301
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:49,823
They're here.

302
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:51,958
Thank you.

303
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:01,084
Leona, I didn't know you
knew where my office was.

304
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:02,919
I followed Reese.

305
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,305
I'm assuming you didn't
come down to tell me

306
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,842
- you found $4 billion in the glove compartment.
- Well, I tried.

307
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:11,511
The glove compartment may be the
only place I haven't looked.

308
00:15:11,562 --> 00:15:14,431
Where do you look for that kind of money,
just out of curiosity?

309
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:16,182
We offered shares
to a special investor

310
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,319
to buy up a portion of the company and
dilute the ownership stake of the twins,

311
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:22,072
but we hit a roadblock
with the board.

312
00:15:22,106 --> 00:15:25,108
We thought about changing the bylaws,
but the lawyer said it wouldn't hold.

313
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,110
We tried banks and hedge funds,

314
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,028
but they know we're
already too leveraged.

315
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,914
I have a $58 million
Jackson Pollock,

316
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:32,749
$140 million yacht.

317
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:34,517
It's not nearly
enough collateral.

318
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:37,420
Boy, listen closely,
you can almost hear someone singing

319
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:39,089
"Brother,
Can You Spare a Dime?"

320
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:41,791
- Yeah, I know.
- I had a perfectly good idea.

321
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:43,343
- No, you didn't.
- What was it?

322
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,512
Poison them.
Poison my half-brother and sister.

323
00:15:45,546 --> 00:15:47,046
Just go Shakespeare
on their ass.

324
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:49,883
- I know people, you know people.
- I don't know people.

325
00:15:49,934 --> 00:15:51,851
All right, well,
there's no such thing as a bad idea.

326
00:15:51,886 --> 00:15:54,104
Yes,
there is such a thing as a bad idea.

327
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:56,106
Horizontal stripes.
That.

328
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,974
I think I know what's coming.

329
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,559
- <i>Charlie.</i>
- Yeah?

330
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:01,895
Randy and Blair, but especially Blair,
and mostly Blair,

331
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:04,864
have to be stopped from selling
their shares to Savannah.

332
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,866
The only way to raise
the money before they...

333
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:09,786
Is to spin off ACN.

334
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,327
Yeah.

335
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:24,083
The buyer is a man named Lucas Pruit.
He's 43 and lives...

336
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:25,919
In Palo Alto.
No wife, no kids.

337
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,220
Stanford '92.
Harvard MBA.

338
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,972
Goldman for five years
as a tech analyst,

339
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:30,473
then he left to start
his own company.

340
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:31,674
Yeah,
I don't know what they do.

341
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,092
They made a WiFi accelerator.

342
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:35,678
He's the 1,398th richest
person in the world.

343
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:37,297
Can I ask some questions?

344
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:39,432
- Did they try to dilute the twins' ownership stake?
- Yes.

345
00:16:39,483 --> 00:16:41,100
- Changing the bylaws?
- Lawyer said no.

346
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:42,852
Offering long-term
contracts and platinum...

347
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,437
They tried everything.

348
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:46,606
What about selling another division?
Why us?

349
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:48,608
Tax consequences.
We were the right price.

350
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,660
- And...
- It's a trophy sale.

351
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:52,946
Yeah.
Owning a news network's

352
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:55,949
cooler than owning a location
detection software company.

353
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:57,917
Would you coven of knee-jerk,
lefty bigots

354
00:16:57,952 --> 00:17:00,086
not condemn the man until
after he's said hello?

355
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,872
I know he's committed the unpardonable
crime of making a lot of money,

356
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:05,041
<i>but perhaps in spite of his talent,
hard work,</i>

357
00:17:05,092 --> 00:17:07,927
and enormous accomplishments,
he's still a decent guy.

358
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:10,930
Yeah,
whose ideas are worth listening to.

359
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,132
Yeah. Wait, what?

360
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:15,852
- He has ideas?
- Yeah.

361
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:17,954
So here's what I need us to do.

362
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:20,640
What you need us to do or what
the Lansings need us to do?

363
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:23,610
At this moment,
what the Lansings want is what I want.

364
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:26,196
They spent the last year doing
nothing but standing by us

365
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,448
when it made a lot
more sense to not.

366
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,900
Not to.
Not to stand by...

367
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,986
To not stand by...

368
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:35,622
- I'm saying it would have made more sense...
- Find your way home.

369
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,657
- ...to dump us.
- I agree.

370
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,077
And since the alternative
to selling ACN to Pruit

371
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:44,163
is ACN being dissolved
by Savannah Capital,

372
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:46,716
- we're gonna love his ideas.
- Sure.

373
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,052
Saturday night at
the Correspondents' Dinner.

374
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:50,920
We're not going to
the Correspondents' Dinner.

375
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,338
- <i>We are now.</i>
- I can't.

376
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,507
The Justice Department
is Friday night

377
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:56,509
<i>and the Correspondents'
Dinner is Saturday.</i>

378
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,679
We can't go because last year he railed
against the Correspondents' Dinner

379
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,514
<i>and said
we'd no longer be going.</i>

380
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:03,516
- Where?
- To the Correspondents' Dinner.

381
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:06,436
- Where did you rail against it?
- On TV.

382
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,988
- What network?
- This one. My show.

383
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,024
I think I remember now.

384
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:16,329
"ACN won't be attending
the Saturnalia of incestuous ingratiation"...

385
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,281
- Oh, brother.
- ..."that does little to instill confidence

386
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:22,201
in the public that the press
isn't ensorcelled by the powerful."

387
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:24,370
I think I was trying
to quit smoking that week.

388
00:18:24,372 --> 00:18:27,290
Well, don't do that again,
'cause that was some huckleberry-bad writing.

389
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,125
- What do you want us to do?
- Go anyway.

390
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,927
Yeah, you got to eat it.

391
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:33,596
Hope nobody remembers
your on-air

392
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:36,299
bacchanal of
boisterous buffoonery

393
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,717
'cause Pruit wants to meet you.

394
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:39,969
And Leona says
he wants to be charmed.

395
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,522
- What do I do?
- Be the charming one.

396
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,308
- And what do you do?
- Clean up when she goes berserk.

397
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,227
I do not go berserk,

398
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:52,231
you addle-minded bit
of American tripe.

399
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:54,784
This is a sad day for dignity.

400
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:56,869
I'll need a dress.

401
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,910
This is the part
I keep tripping on.

402
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:06,913
<i>- What's that?</i>
- I'm still looking at your contract.

403
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:10,583
45K. 45 large,
my young friend.

404
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:12,168
45 Grover Clevelands.

405
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,853
Grover Cleveland's
on the $1,000 bill?

406
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,421
Back when we printed them.

407
00:19:15,423 --> 00:19:17,974
They're not in circulation anymore,
but imagine 45 of them.

408
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:20,760
That'll give you a sense of my
annual salary beginning Monday.

409
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:23,096
It's not Jim Harper money,
but it'll pay the rent.

410
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:24,647
As long as I don't pay
any other bills.

411
00:19:24,682 --> 00:19:26,432
It's more than 45
with the incentives.

412
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:28,801
I know,
but I'm not counting my chickens.

413
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:31,187
- Do you feel like...
- Just my Clevelands.

414
00:19:33,374 --> 00:19:35,325
Okay.

415
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,945
- What were you gonna say?
- Nothing.

416
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:42,165
- What?
- The incentives.

417
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,534
James, they're not incentives,
they're bonuses.

418
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,285
- For page views.
- Yeah.

419
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:48,788
The more page views you get,
the more money you're paid.

420
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:51,674
Welcome to capitalism.
We're happy to have you.

421
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:53,343
They're bonuses,
they're not incentives.

422
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:54,877
- <i>Hallie, look.</i>
- What?

423
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,296
- If you're okay with it, be okay with it.
- I am.

424
00:19:57,348 --> 00:19:59,432
If you were,
then you wouldn't need to call it something else.

425
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,035
It says bonuses right there.
I'm not the one calling it something else.

426
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:04,520
If you're writing about
a cabinet secretary

427
00:20:04,555 --> 00:20:06,522
who testified in front of the
House Oversight Committee,

428
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:09,859
are you more likely to write about
the content of the testimony

429
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:12,812
or "Cabinet Secretary
Blasts Darrell Issa"?

430
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:14,814
Your hero is Will McAvoy,
right?

431
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,983
- He's getting there.
- Your hero is Ed Murrow, right?

432
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:20,236
- Yeah.
- Will is paid millions of dollars a year

433
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,488
and Murrow was paid the equivalent
of millions of dollars a year

434
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,074
for the same reason anyone in the
private sector is paid anything...

435
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,993
Their ability to make
money for other people.

436
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,878
Will doesn't get paid
per view or per story.

437
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:31,831
That's either heart-stopping
naiveté or denial.

438
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:35,334
Our rundown meetings don't include
a discussion of what's grabby.

439
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:37,670
<i>And after a week of covering Boston,
you're now in fourth place.</i>

440
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:40,173
And Charlie makes sure we don't care.
That's my point.

441
00:20:40,175 --> 00:20:42,642
I understand how market
forces work in the news,

442
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:45,144
but journalists have always been the
people pushing back against them.

443
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,729
And now you're being
incentivized to...

444
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:49,148
My incentives are no different than
a reporter at <i>The New York Times</i>.

445
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:51,851
If those reporters were being paid
per person reading their story,

446
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:53,519
the front page of the <i>Times</i>
would look a lot different.

447
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:55,154
And because it doesn't
look a lot different,

448
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,106
there are a lot fewer people
reading their stories.

449
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,358
Who, Hallie,
gives a genuine shit

450
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,061
how many people are reading a
story if the story is hyped?

451
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:04,330
Someone who gets paid
per page view.

452
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:08,201
Your confidence in my integrity

453
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:10,253
moves me in ways I don't
even know what to do.

454
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:13,372
- Don't take this job.
- This is an exciting startup founded by people...

455
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:16,342
- Who are self-serving tools.
- That's exactly what they say about you.

456
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,961
And you don't think that has something
to do with why they want to hire you?

457
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,514
Hmm?
Someone who just got fired from ACN

458
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,099
for tweeting a snarky joke?

459
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,384
I think my talent has something to
do with why they want to hire me.

460
00:21:25,436 --> 00:21:27,386
Of course your talent
is why they want to hire you,

461
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:29,472
but are you the only talented
person that they interviewed?

462
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,357
I'm the most talented person
that they interviewed.

463
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,476
- I believe that.
- You believe they want to hire me

464
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:35,228
because I have
an ax to grind with ACN,

465
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,481
which, for the 100th time,
I do not.

466
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:43,035
You know a lot of things,
Hallie, because of me.

467
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:45,905
You know a lot about Genoa.

468
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:47,874
You know a lot about private
behavior in the newsroom.

469
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:50,409
- Look...
- And you know some things about Neal.

470
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:54,580
Not everything,
but you know some things.

471
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:58,084
And it's really dangerous.

472
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:08,227
You think I'd tell secrets?
Things you've told me in this room?

473
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,896
What's your bonus again?

474
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:13,399
- Holy shit.
- I was kidding.

475
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,334
The only way for you to get out
of this conversation alive

476
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:18,154
is to roll over, turn off the light,
and go to sleep.

477
00:22:19,323 --> 00:22:21,073
- I was kidding.
- Do what I said.

478
00:22:22,693 --> 00:22:24,811
We're not supposed
to go to bed mad.

479
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:26,612
Honey,
it would take a Bradley Fighting Vehicle

480
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:28,948
to move me to mad from my
current level of furious.

481
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,867
So turn off the fucking light,
go to sleep,

482
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:32,535
and we'll try this
again tomorrow.

483
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,620
Okay.

484
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:37,206
Don't go to sleep.
We're gonna talk about this.

485
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:39,041
Okay.

486
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,911
They should be here any second.

487
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:03,482
You're the first person
I've ever met named Wyatt.

488
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:04,984
It's a family name.

489
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:09,906
How'd you like to have
Earp as a last name?

490
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:12,158
That had to be tough on the playground,
hmm?

491
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,544
Maybe that's how
he got so tough.

492
00:23:16,163 --> 00:23:18,164
Am I making you nervous?

493
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,498
No.

494
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,751
Sometimes people
get nervous around HR.

495
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,836
I don't get nervous.
You know who gets nervous?

496
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:25,838
Criminals.

497
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:27,723
Come on in.

498
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:32,178
Gary Cooper, Alex Thacker,
this is Wyatt Geary

499
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:34,513
<i>and he is the new VP of
Human Resources for AWM.</i>

500
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:36,515
- Please have a seat.
- There are no chairs left.

501
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:39,185
- Alex, HR received a complaint from you.
- That's right.

502
00:23:39,236 --> 00:23:41,404
And it was kicked down the chain
from Charlie to Mac to me.

503
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:42,905
So why don't you
tell us what happened?

504
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,074
It's in the report I wrote
that's in front of you.

505
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,578
Yes, I want them to tell me
in their own words.

506
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:50,413
- Don, it's really nothing.
- I have no doubt.

507
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:52,198
- It's not nothing.
- Okay.

508
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,333
You asked for 20 seconds
of copy for Elliot

509
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,952
on Justin Bieber visiting
Anne Frank's house.

510
00:23:56,003 --> 00:23:58,838
Why, you know,
in the world would I do that?

511
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,923
Because Bieber signed the
guestbook on his way out

512
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,009
and wrote
"Hopefully she would have been a Belieber."

513
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:05,962
And then you and Elliot got drunk and
you told him you'd give him $100

514
00:24:06,013 --> 00:24:07,964
if he could read the story off
the prompter without laughing.

515
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:10,883
Once again,
this is the new HR rep for our parent company.

516
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:13,352
The copy should have been assigned to me,
but Gary assigned it to Stacey.

517
00:24:13,387 --> 00:24:15,605
Once I give it to Gary,
Gary gets to make that call.

518
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:17,056
Based on merit,
not based on who

519
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:19,058
he prefers to sleep with
at any particular moment.

520
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm not sleeping and I've
never slept with Stacey.

521
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:23,562
That may or may not be,
but probably is a lie.

522
00:24:23,614 --> 00:24:25,898
What we know for sure
is Gary flirted with me,

523
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,900
hit on me, took me out five times,
slept with me twice,

524
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:31,287
and then dumped me in a pile with the rest
of the staffers he's used for his pleasure.

525
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:34,073
I can't emphasize this enough...
This is the new HR rep.

526
00:24:34,075 --> 00:24:35,458
And I'm fine with all of that.

527
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:37,093
- So we're cool.
- No.

528
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,462
What I am not fine with is being
passed over for an assignment at work

529
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:41,580
because I exercised poor
judgment in my personal life.

530
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:43,749
I gave it to her because she's
better at this kind of thing.

531
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:45,668
What kind of thing?

532
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,137
The intersection of pop
culture and the Holocaust.

533
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,805
- That might sound crazy.
- It did.

534
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,091
Look, I've gone out with several
of the women in this building.

535
00:24:52,093 --> 00:24:54,677
Maybe you don't understand
what HR does.

536
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:56,646
You're saying Stacey is a
better writer than I am?

537
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,931
- She's a different writer than you.
- Different?

538
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:00,933
Like I'm tired of this one,
so I'll try a different one?

539
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:03,486
I told Gary to give it to Stacey, all right?
He is covering for me.

540
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,405
I told him to give it to her because
she is a better writer than you are.

541
00:25:07,441 --> 00:25:09,191
Well, what am I supposed to do?

542
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:11,110
Write better.

543
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:13,145
That's it.
Thank you both.

544
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,197
Thank you.

545
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:23,089
All right.
Close the books on that one.

546
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:26,676
Fraternization between
superiors and subordinates

547
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,011
exposes the company
to all kinds of problems,

548
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:31,430
- including the one you just saw.
- And we don't tolerate it.

549
00:25:31,465 --> 00:25:34,050
- You're the EP of the 10:00 hour.
- I am.

550
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:37,303
- Which is sometimes anchored by Sloan Sabbith.
- Yes.

551
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:41,057
So if you and Sloan Sabbith
were in a relationship,

552
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:44,060
there's a chance we'd have to move
one of you to a different bureau.

553
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:46,562
- DC or LA.
- Yeah, but we're not.

554
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:48,647
- Are you sure about that?
- Am I sure?

555
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:49,865
- Yes.
- Yes.

556
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,451
Because then lying about it
would make it worse.

557
00:25:55,622 --> 00:25:57,373
Mm-hmm.

558
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:58,824
I can see that.

559
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:02,328
My predecessor was pretty relaxed
about this kind of thing.

560
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,664
And we're already in a tricky spot
with Will McAvoy marrying his EP.

561
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:08,050
But no one's gonna
mess with Will,

562
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:11,837
so I guess my point is if you're
going to date a subordinate,

563
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:13,422
you better have
stronger ratings.

564
00:26:13,473 --> 00:26:16,842
I don't see our ratings going up any time soon,

565
00:26:16,844 --> 00:26:19,095
so I guess I'll just keep the
company directory in the drawer.

566
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:20,596
- Okay.
- Okay.

567
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,348
Can you tell me how to get
to Sloan Sabbith's office?

568
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,434
Back to the elevators
and it's on 22.

569
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:27,186
Thank you.

570
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:29,355
Welcome to the company.

571
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:39,865
Ahem.

572
00:26:52,963 --> 00:26:54,713
We're not dating.

573
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,050
Okay.

574
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:05,624
Hey.

575
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:08,978
Ahem, "What forms of alternative
energy are real options

576
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,730
to replace coal and gasoline,
and why are they taking so long

577
00:27:11,782 --> 00:27:13,699
to assume sizable parts
of the marketplace?"

578
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:15,484
- Great question.
- Yeah, you wrote it.

579
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:17,536
I thought the idea
was to figure out a way

580
00:27:17,571 --> 00:27:19,572
to capture people's
attention with the report

581
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,207
and the interview
with the head of the EPA.

582
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:23,909
You said he was the Deputy Assistant
Administrator of the EPA.

583
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,462
So let's be sure we identify him,
you know, right.

584
00:27:26,496 --> 00:27:29,715
Yeah, but I think that's
the least of our problems.

585
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:31,250
No, it's not.
It's just the first of our problems.

586
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:34,053
And I'm saying the guy has a job and
a title and can we not hype it up?

587
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:36,922
I have confidence in the graphic,
but where I need your help...

588
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:38,257
Is in hyping it up.

589
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:41,060
The air has a very dangerous
level of poison gas in it.

590
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:43,479
Why do we have to write Will
questions like it's a sex test

591
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:45,981
in <i>Sex</i>, you know,
<i>Magazine</i> or something?

592
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:48,184
- <i>Sex Magazine</i>?
- Yeah, I couldn't think of a real...

593
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:50,853
We've switched sides.
Yesterday you told me I was boring you.

594
00:27:50,904 --> 00:27:52,605
I was wrong.

595
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:54,907
"China's demand
for coal is increasing

596
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:57,193
as it continues to urbanize
and industrialize,

597
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:00,112
but so has its demand for
solar power and wind energy."

598
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:01,780
- That isn't even a question.
- No, look.

599
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:03,499
"Your thoughts?"

600
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:05,417
I want to hear his thoughts.

601
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:08,838
I came over and told you
about the EPA report

602
00:28:08,872 --> 00:28:11,173
- and the interview Friday with Richard Westbrook.
- Yeah.

603
00:28:11,258 --> 00:28:13,042
You told me I was boring you.

604
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:15,010
I asked for help.
You gloated.

605
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:17,630
And then what?

606
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:20,799
Did you know there are
online news outlets

607
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:23,686
that offer bonuses to their
reporters for page views?

608
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,472
- Yes.
- I didn't know that.

609
00:28:26,523 --> 00:28:28,974
That's because you live
in the time of King Arthur

610
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,476
along with Don, Will,
and Charlie.

611
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:31,777
I don't live in the time
of King Arthur.

612
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,279
You live in the time
of King Arthur.

613
00:28:33,313 --> 00:28:34,313
You don't see
an immediate danger

614
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:37,149
in offering cash
for trash on a news site?

615
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,868
I understand.

616
00:28:38,902 --> 00:28:40,152
Thank you.

617
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:41,987
You were a dick to Hallie.

618
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:44,073
- No, I wasn't.
- Tiny bit dicky?

619
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,408
What am I supposed to say
when she comes home

620
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,827
with a contract for a job at a
new website called "Carnivore"?

621
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,162
"Congratulations."

622
00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:52,498
I said congratulations.
I supported her ass off.

623
00:28:52,549 --> 00:28:54,133
- And then?
- I saw the contract.

624
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:55,584
- And you were a dick.
- I wasn't.

625
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:57,586
A little bit Dickensian
in your special way

626
00:28:57,637 --> 00:29:00,055
that says,
"I love you, but you suck."

627
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,475
She got fired.
She was humiliated.

628
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,094
And I'm sure
you were there for her,

629
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:07,763
but I'm also 100% certain

630
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:11,600
there was something in your voice that said,
"You deserved it."

631
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:16,855
Ahem,
I don't want what I'm about to say

632
00:29:16,907 --> 00:29:18,908
to be misconstrued
as agreeing with you,

633
00:29:18,942 --> 00:29:23,112
but I'll try to be conscious
of that and do better.

634
00:29:24,447 --> 00:29:25,998
Good.

635
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:28,167
Who are you bringing to
the Correspondents' Dinner?

636
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:31,036
I met a really nice guy on
the train back from Boston.

637
00:29:31,087 --> 00:29:33,255
Guess what he teaches
at Fordham Law School.

638
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,874
- What?
- Ethics.

639
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:38,093
Leave it to you to find
the only person in the world

640
00:29:38,128 --> 00:29:39,678
who can make money
being ethical.

641
00:29:39,713 --> 00:29:41,046
I know.

642
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,800
How did you get the EPA report
and the exclusive interview?

643
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,706
This was really
the best place to meet?

644
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:09,625
- Yeah. Were you followed?
- No.

645
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:11,293
- You were followed.
- By who?

646
00:30:11,328 --> 00:30:13,379
Me,
just to show you that I can.

647
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:15,080
Just stand up a second.

648
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:17,216
You asked for the meeting.

649
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,584
Please.

650
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,643
We've known each other since we
were too young to rent a car.

651
00:30:27,677 --> 00:30:29,595
That's the only reason
I'm here.

652
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:35,150
If anyone knew I was,
I'd be asked to hand over my badge and my gun

653
00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:37,653
and I would never in my
life be able to get a job

654
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:39,688
that required trustworthiness.

655
00:30:39,739 --> 00:30:42,441
Can you think of a job
that doesn't?

656
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:44,777
- No.
- So there we are.

657
00:30:46,746 --> 00:30:49,581
We found some compelling
evidence on Neal's hard drive

658
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:52,501
that he helped his source transfer
the docs from the SIPRNet.

659
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:57,990
How compelling?

660
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,710
If you're able
to contact him...

661
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:04,296
I don't know if you are...

662
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,532
but if someone is able
to contact him,

663
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:09,601
they should tell him
to come in.

664
00:31:09,636 --> 00:31:13,672
He needs a lawyer
and he needs to cooperate.

665
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:15,774
To commit the crime
you're suggesting,

666
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:18,727
Neal would have had to have had
knowledge he was committing a crime,

667
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:20,863
knowledge he couldn't
possibly have had

668
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:22,064
when the source contacted him.

669
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:23,782
A reporter you'd be
willing to work with

670
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:26,385
can't tell the difference between
a credible source and a fugazi?

671
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:29,488
Yes, I'd be willing to work
with Dan Rather and CBS News.

672
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,490
We don't want Neal.

673
00:31:31,492 --> 00:31:35,227
We want...
We have to have his source.

674
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:39,231
This is a bad guy.

675
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,834
And what are you gonna do
to Neal to get his name?

676
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:44,169
We're not gonna throw
a bag over his head.

677
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:47,256
But you are gonna threaten him with
conspiracy to commit espionage.

678
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:49,007
It's not gonna be
an idle threat.

679
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:51,844
Our experts were very impressed

680
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:54,263
with his technical
sophistication.

681
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,315
You can bring him in

682
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,567
or we can kick his door down.

683
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:09,194
Okay.

684
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:15,634
You know you just revealed to me that you
knew he helped with the document transfer.

685
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:18,253
Yeah.

686
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:20,172
Trust.

687
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:44,780
Thanks for meeting me so late.

688
00:32:44,814 --> 00:32:46,949
What's going on?

689
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:51,653
I want to ask you something and I
want you to tell me the truth,

690
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:54,490
but I don't want you to tell
me any more than you're asked.

691
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:00,712
All right.

692
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:03,715
Is anyone in touch with Neal?

693
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,252
Through an uncle who talks to his cousin?
Anything?

694
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:16,979
Yes,
somebody's in touch with Neal.

695
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:19,314
Get a message
to him to come in.

696
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,819
Friday night in DC
at Main Justice.

697
00:33:23,853 --> 00:33:26,355
He'll have immunity
at the meeting.

698
00:33:26,406 --> 00:33:28,323
What about after the meeting?

699
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:35,247
No reporter's ever been charged
under the Espionage Act.

700
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,376
All right.

701
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,964
Okay.

702
00:34:01,724 --> 00:34:03,609
<i>Anzar Tsarnaev,
the father of...</i>

703
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:05,978
- Stand by, G7 and 7A.
- Standing.

704
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,063
<i>...will be traveling from
Russia to the US this week.</i>

705
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,982
<i>Meanwhile,
Jahar remains hospitalized</i>

706
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:12,484
- <i>and no date yet has been set for his arraignment.</i>
- Go 7.

707
00:34:12,535 --> 00:34:15,621
Today the federal government
released a startling finding

708
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:18,240
on the level of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.

709
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,375
<i>We'll have EPA Deputy Assistant
Administrator Richard...</i>

710
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,327
- <i>Ready SOT-4.</i>
- <i>Ready.</i>

711
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:25,414
- <i>But first, ACN's Maggie Jordan filed this report.</i>
<i>- Go SOT-4.</i>

712
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,382
<i>A grave warning
today from scientists</i>

713
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:30,552
<i>at the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.</i>

714
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:33,338
<i>The world has passed
a long-feared milestone.</i>

715
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,308
- Mr. Westbrook?
- Yeah.

716
00:34:36,342 --> 00:34:37,843
I'll take you
to the studio now.

717
00:34:37,845 --> 00:34:40,345
Okay.

718
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:42,981
<i>...reaching a concentration
not seen on the Earth</i>

719
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:44,349
<i>for millions of years.</i>

720
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,851
<i>Scientists took this reading...</i>

721
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:48,153
Will, we're running light.

722
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:51,156
- Can you tease the interview out another 40 seconds?
- Yeah.

723
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,193
<i>30 seconds.</i>

724
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:58,280
- <i>How are you? I'm Will.</i>
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>

725
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:00,282
So there won't be
any hard questions.

726
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,950
I'm just gonna ask you
to expand on the report.

727
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:04,202
Pretend you're an expert
witness and I'm your lawyer.

728
00:35:04,254 --> 00:35:05,704
- Sounds good.
- In 10.

729
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:07,839
<i>- Here we go.</i>
<i>- Stand by, camera one.</i>

730
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:10,759
<i>...the 450 parts per
million will soon be crossed.</i>

731
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:14,463
<i>The question remains,
how will we respond?</i>

732
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:16,765
<i>And joining us now in studio
is Richard Westbrook,</i>

733
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:18,850
<i>Deputy Assistant
Administrator of the EPA.</i>

734
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,719
- <i>Welcome.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

735
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,854
Mr. Westbrook,
you've spent most of your professional career

736
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:25,140
as a climate scientist
in the public sector.

737
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:28,477
Yes, 10 years as a supervisory
management analyst

738
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:30,562
in the Office of
Environmental Information.

739
00:35:30,564 --> 00:35:33,148
And before that,
I was a program specialist

740
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,400
in the EPA's Resource
Management Division.

741
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:37,986
And you have a PhD in climate
science from Stanford.

742
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:40,405
Yes, and another in chemistry
with a masters in biology.

743
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:43,408
Okay. Tell us about the findings in
the report that was just released.

744
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:47,379
The latest measurements
taken at Mauna Loa in Hawaii

745
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:50,666
indicate a CO2 level
of 400 parts per million.

746
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:52,918
Just so we know
what we're talking about,

747
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,087
if you were a doctor
and we were the patient,

748
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:58,640
what's your prognosis?
1,000 years? 2,000 years?

749
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:00,926
A person has already
been born who will die

750
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:03,178
due to catastrophic
failure of the planet.

751
00:36:05,014 --> 00:36:06,848
What did he just say?

752
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:12,654
- Okay, can you expand on that?
- Sure.

753
00:36:12,689 --> 00:36:15,574
The last time there was
this much CO2 in the air,

754
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:18,276
the oceans were 80 feet
higher than they are now.

755
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:21,163
Two things you should know...
Half the world's population

756
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:24,116
lives within 120 miles
of an ocean.

757
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:26,868
- And the other?
- Humans can't breathe under water.

758
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,755
<i>You're saying
the situation's dire?</i>

759
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:31,673
<i>Not exactly.</i>

760
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:34,459
<i>Your house is burning to the ground,
the situation's dire.</i>

761
00:36:34,461 --> 00:36:38,597
<i>Your house has already burned to the ground,
the situation's over.</i>

762
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:41,350
<i>So what can we do
to reverse this?</i>

763
00:36:41,384 --> 00:36:42,884
- There's a lot we could do.
- Good.

764
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:46,054
If it were 20 years ago
or even 10 years ago.

765
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:48,140
But now... No.

766
00:36:48,142 --> 00:36:52,728
<i>Can you make an analogy
that might help us understand?</i>

767
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:55,947
Sure.
It's as if you're sitting in your car

768
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:59,985
in your garage with the engine
running and the door closed

769
00:37:00,036 --> 00:37:02,821
and you've slipped
into unconsciousness.

770
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:05,490
And that...
That's it.

771
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:07,926
What if someone comes
and opens the door?

772
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,412
- You're already dead.
- What if the person got there in time?

773
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:12,080
- You'd be saved.
- Okay.

774
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:15,801
<i>So now what's the CO2 equivalent
of the getting there on time?</i>

775
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:18,503
<i>Shutting off the car
20 years ago.</i>

776
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:22,340
You sound like you're
saying it's hopeless.

777
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:24,059
Yeah.

778
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:26,645
Is that the administration's
position or yours?

779
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,980
<i>There isn't a position
on this any more than</i>

780
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:32,901
<i>there's a position on the
temperature at which water boils.</i>

781
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:36,188
<i>The administration...
Let me try to... Your administration...</i>

782
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,690
And don't forget
I need you to stretch 40.

783
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:40,492
<i>...clean coal,
nuclear power,</i>

784
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:42,277
<i>raising fuel economy standards</i>

785
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:44,863
<i>and building a more efficient
electrical grid.</i>

786
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,698
- Yes.
- And?

787
00:37:46,749 --> 00:37:48,950
That would have been great.

788
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,169
Let's see if we can't
find a better spin.

789
00:37:51,204 --> 00:37:52,704
People are starting
their weekends.

790
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:57,626
The report says we can release
565 more gigatons of CO2

791
00:37:57,677 --> 00:37:59,211
without the effects
being calamitous.

792
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:01,213
It says we can only
release 565 gigatons.

793
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:03,215
So,
what if we only release 564?

794
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:06,268
Well, then we would have a
reasonable shot at some form

795
00:38:06,302 --> 00:38:08,720
of dystopian,
post-apocalyptic life.

796
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:11,640
<i>But the carbon dioxide
in the oil</i>

797
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:16,228
<i>that we've already leased
is 2,795 gigatons.</i>

798
00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:18,146
<i>So...</i>

799
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:21,533
<i>What would all this look like?</i>

800
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:25,487
Well, mass migrations,
food and water shortages,

801
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:28,707
<i>spread of deadly disease,
endless wildfires.</i>

802
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:31,409
Way too many to keep
under control.

803
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:34,246
Storms that have the power
to level cities,

804
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:37,632
blacken out the sky,
and create permanent darkness.

805
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,836
Are you gonna get in trouble
for saying this publically?

806
00:38:40,887 --> 00:38:42,220
Who cares?

807
00:38:42,255 --> 00:38:44,723
<i>Mr. Westbrook,
we want to inform people,</i>

808
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,274
<i>but we don't want
to alarm them.</i>

809
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:48,810
<i>Can you give us a reason
to be optimistic?</i>

810
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:51,012
Well, that's the thing, Will.

811
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,765
Americans are
optimistic by nature.

812
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:57,152
And if we face
this problem head on,

813
00:38:57,186 --> 00:38:59,688
if we listen to our
best scientists,

814
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:03,859
and act decisively
and passionately,

815
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,777
I still don't see
any way we can survive.

816
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:06,945
Okay, Richard Westbrook,

817
00:39:06,947 --> 00:39:09,414
<i>Deputy Assistant
Administrator of the EPA.</i>

818
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,116
- <i>Thank you for joining us.</i>
<i>- Thanks for having me.</i>

819
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:13,785
<i>This is </i>News Night<i>.
We'll be back right after this.</i>

820
00:39:14,837 --> 00:39:16,755
Herb?

821
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,373
Yeah, yeah.
We're out.

822
00:39:33,723 --> 00:39:37,142
Is this a tactic,
making us wait?

823
00:39:37,193 --> 00:39:40,061
Have you done this?

824
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:43,231
Look, US, US, US, US.

825
00:39:43,282 --> 00:39:46,117
We're on the same team.

826
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:48,987
But, yes, it's a tactic.

827
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:51,907
When we meet Pruit tomorrow night,
let's not mention this.

828
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,992
He's gonna find out
sooner or later.

829
00:39:53,994 --> 00:39:55,827
I want it to be later,
after his check clears.

830
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:09,474
- Maybe he's...
- Don't get up.

831
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:12,227
I'm Barry Lasenthal,
Assistant Attorney General

832
00:40:12,261 --> 00:40:13,979
for National Security.

833
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:16,348
- You're Rebecca Halliday?
- Yes, sir.

834
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:18,483
You've let your clients know there'll
be no record of this meeting?

835
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,101
- <i>Yes.</i>
- I wish there was.

836
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:22,604
- What's that?
- I said I wish there was.

837
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:24,656
Do you mind if I ask why
you're sitting so far away?

838
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,275
I do mind.
Would you like to register a complaint?

839
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:30,161
Reporters having their asses

840
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:31,780
hauled into the Justice
Department doesn't sit well...

841
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:34,249
I'll see that your concerns make
it straight to the children

842
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:37,502
of undercover agents who've been killed
when their identities were made known.

843
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:41,473
You're bringing out your queen a little early,
aren't you?

844
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:44,709
Mr. Lasenthal,
our intention is to work with the FBI

845
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:47,712
or any relevant officials
as we've always done in the past

846
00:40:47,747 --> 00:40:51,299
to ensure the story
is responsibly reported.

847
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,951
But it'll be reported.

848
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,520
Not my pig, not my farm.

849
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:57,806
I don't know that expression.

850
00:40:57,857 --> 00:41:00,692
He's saying someone else
is handling the story.

851
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:03,895
See,
Will is from Nebraska, too.

852
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,164
But I wasn't recruited
by Nebraska,

853
00:41:06,198 --> 00:41:09,050
so I played fullback at A&M.

854
00:41:09,085 --> 00:41:13,371
And we lost to Nebraska
all four years I was there.

855
00:41:13,406 --> 00:41:15,707
Whew.

856
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:17,909
The story is someone
else's concern.

857
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,712
But I can tell you if you report
news that was gathered illegally,

858
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:23,581
you'll face criminal fines in an
amount that will bankrupt you.

859
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,383
They understand that.
Let's begin.

860
00:41:25,418 --> 00:41:27,135
My problem is what's
on that flash drive.

861
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:28,920
- Let's begin.
- Are you running this meeting?

862
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:32,057
- When I need to.
- How about we cool it, okay?

863
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:34,843
You want to see what
information we can give you

864
00:41:34,894 --> 00:41:37,012
without us naming the source,
and that's fair.

865
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:39,431
But any conversation
has to start

866
00:41:39,465 --> 00:41:42,767
with our knowing that Neal
Sampat is safe from prosecution.

867
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,186
He is safe from prosecution.

868
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,738
<i>We need that in writing.</i>

869
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:49,441
Neal Sampat is in Maracaibo,
Venezuela.

870
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:57,082
He flew there yesterday from Calgary
International Airport by way of Cuba.

871
00:41:57,116 --> 00:41:59,834
Not for nothing,
but this is a building full of lawyers

872
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:02,537
who'd have no problem making
that look an awful lot to a jury

873
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:05,457
like tradecraft from a
dark-skinned young man.

874
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:07,175
Now maybe it's just
a coincidence,

875
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:08,960
but in all three
of those pictures,

876
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:11,463
he's looking over
his shoulder a little.

877
00:42:11,514 --> 00:42:13,548
He'll be doing that
for the rest of his life.

878
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,800
- That's his punishment.
- Punishment for what?

879
00:42:15,851 --> 00:42:18,520
I don't believe what...
His punishment?

880
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:20,972
Punishment for what?

881
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:23,174
We're a couple of inches
away from being able

882
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:25,477
to show he induced his source
to commit a felony.

883
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,278
You're a long way off
from demonstrating

884
00:42:27,313 --> 00:42:29,147
that he had knowledge
he was committing a crime.

885
00:42:29,149 --> 00:42:32,283
Closer now that he's vacationing in a
country with no extradition treaty.

886
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,653
Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of this kid.

887
00:42:35,705 --> 00:42:38,039
I've seen some things,
you know?

888
00:42:38,074 --> 00:42:42,627
I have been around,
but we've got to work on getting him back now.

889
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:45,330
Counsel, ask your questions.

890
00:42:48,918 --> 00:42:51,669
What time did Mr. Sampat
first make contact?

891
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:54,139
Monday evening, April 15.
A week ago Monday.

892
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:55,507
<i>Where was he at the time?</i>

893
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,308
His desk at ACN's
New York bureau.

894
00:42:57,343 --> 00:43:00,512
The source made contact with Mr. Sampat,
not the other way.

895
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:02,647
My next question was
how was contact made.

896
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:05,183
The source contacted
Neal over ACN.com

897
00:43:05,185 --> 00:43:06,434
and asked for his
encryption key.

898
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:09,154
- <i>And what was his response?</i>
- To give it to him.

899
00:43:09,188 --> 00:43:11,272
And then the source asked for
a higher level of encryption?

900
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:13,992
I won't answer that
at this time.

901
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:17,746
Did Mr. Sampat tell you
the name of the source?

902
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,298
- Yes.
<i>- Did he tell you anything else about the source?</i>

903
00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:22,467
- Yes.
<i>- Will you tell us the name of the source?</i>

904
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:25,136
- No, sir.
<i>- Will you tell us anything else about the source?</i>

905
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:28,206
- No.
- Well, you've got a problem.

906
00:43:29,575 --> 00:43:31,409
For one thing,
it's a myth that the First Amendment

907
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:34,262
protects you in situations like this.
Branzburg v. Hayes...

908
00:43:34,296 --> 00:43:36,714
Justice Powell made it clear
the exception exists.

909
00:43:36,716 --> 00:43:39,017
Not clear enough.

910
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:42,687
A laptop computer was purchased
with your American Express card

911
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:45,557
at the Best Buy at 44th
and 5th in Manhattan,

912
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:49,594
but the signature on the receipt
doesn't match your handwriting.

913
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,896
You gave your credit card
to Neal Sampat

914
00:43:51,898 --> 00:43:53,782
to buy an air-gapped computer,
right?

915
00:43:53,866 --> 00:43:55,366
This ends our cooperation.

916
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:58,787
What I think is this is
exactly where you were going.

917
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:03,374
See, what I think is that either to
protect Neal or be a hero or both,

918
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:06,911
you engineered this whole thing
so that Neal was cleared out

919
00:44:06,913 --> 00:44:08,713
and you were left
holding the bag.

920
00:44:11,183 --> 00:44:14,169
But you forgot what else
was in the bag.

921
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:18,056
This receipt.

922
00:44:19,892 --> 00:44:22,193
Who's the source, Will?

923
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:24,062
No one has to know
you gave him up.

924
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:26,798
<i>No one has to know it was you.</i>

925
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:34,522
- I'll tell you what, Mr. Lasenthal.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

926
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:38,109
- You're bad at this.
- Is that right?

927
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:41,279
You come in here
like Brian Dennehy.

928
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:44,332
You're at the other end of the table
'cause it's some Jedi mind shit

929
00:44:44,366 --> 00:44:46,501
you were taught at a three-day
seminar in Hilton Head.

930
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:49,204
I was the one most apt
to cooperate.

931
00:44:49,255 --> 00:44:50,872
<i>The agents must have
reported that to you.</i>

932
00:44:50,923 --> 00:44:52,590
<i>That's the signal
I was sending you.</i>

933
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:55,760
But you insulted our lawyer
and you insulted my producer

934
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:58,129
who happens to be my fiancée,
which you also know.

935
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,098
And you insulted
Charlie Skinner,

936
00:45:00,132 --> 00:45:02,684
<i>which your people would have told you
wasn't gonna make any of us happy.</i>

937
00:45:02,718 --> 00:45:04,469
And you threatened
to bankrupt us

938
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,354
and to have
the same PR operation

939
00:45:06,388 --> 00:45:10,308
that got 38 people killed
turn Neal into a radical.

940
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:13,978
Yeah, I moved the pieces so
they'd end up looking like this.

941
00:45:14,029 --> 00:45:15,730
<i>Except Neal's supposed
to be in a Super 8</i>

942
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:18,566
<i>in Bayonne, New Jersey,
and not South America.</i>

943
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:21,486
And I did it because,
while I have no doubt

944
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:24,038
that you'd shake Neal up and down
until he gave you the source,

945
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:26,324
<i>which would never happen,</i>

946
00:45:26,326 --> 00:45:28,743
your jaw-dropping
government overreach

947
00:45:28,794 --> 00:45:33,398
simply won't extend to putting a
TV star in jail for contempt.

948
00:45:33,432 --> 00:45:37,385
You bungled this and I
can't help you anymore.

949
00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:42,757
That's it.

950
00:45:49,398 --> 00:45:51,599
I fucking hated
losing to Nebraska.

951
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:54,352
I'd have thought you'd
have gotten used to it.

952
00:46:03,112 --> 00:46:05,947
<i>I... Look, I get it.</i>

953
00:46:05,998 --> 00:46:09,367
<i>These days I look in the
mirror and I have to admit</i>

954
00:46:09,418 --> 00:46:12,971
<i>I'm not the strapping young Muslim
Socialist that I used to be.</i>

955
00:46:18,794 --> 00:46:21,512
<i>Time passes,</i>

956
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:23,214
<i>you get a little grey.</i>

957
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,192
Hey.

958
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:36,728
Uh, Hallie Shea, Jim Harper,

959
00:46:36,779 --> 00:46:38,529
this is Jack Spaniel.

960
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:40,231
- Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

961
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:41,733
How'd you two meet?

962
00:46:41,784 --> 00:46:44,235
It was on a train
coming back from Boston.

963
00:46:44,237 --> 00:46:46,321
Maggie overheard a man
talking to a reporter,

964
00:46:46,372 --> 00:46:48,573
but passed on the story
because she didn't like

965
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,742
that she slid down
in her seat to get it.

966
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:52,910
The man she overheard was
so impressed by her ethics

967
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:55,079
that he gave her an exclusive.

968
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:56,414
I teach ethics,

969
00:46:56,416 --> 00:46:59,133
<i>so I was vocationally
attracted to the situation.</i>

970
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:02,503
And the story you got in exchange was
that the world was coming to an end.

971
00:47:02,554 --> 00:47:04,555
Pretty good for a Friday.

972
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,391
It almost sounds like something
you read in a tabloid.

973
00:47:06,425 --> 00:47:08,426
Hey,
nothing's wrong with tabloids.

974
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:12,230
Elvis ever comes back,
you're not gonna read about it in <i>The Washington Post</i>.

975
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:14,098
Good point.

976
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,434
We are gonna get
something to eat.

977
00:47:16,436 --> 00:47:18,353
Oh, okay.

978
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,241
Was that for me,
the ethics parable?

979
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,193
I hadn't heard that story
until just now.

980
00:47:25,244 --> 00:47:26,861
Charlie wants to see
everyone in five minutes

981
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,613
in the kitchen in the west
side of the building.

982
00:47:28,615 --> 00:47:30,448
Okay.

983
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,168
You're the one
who asked how they met.

984
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:42,543
I sent in at least three jokes
that would have killed.

985
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:45,013
Those guys never use my jokes.
You know why?

986
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:47,348
- I do.
- Speech writer snobbery.

987
00:47:47,383 --> 00:47:48,966
I think it's something else.

988
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:50,685
Mmm, taste this.
It's fantastic.

989
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:52,303
What is it?

990
00:47:52,305 --> 00:47:53,688
I don't believe it.
He's here.

991
00:47:53,722 --> 00:47:56,641
Sir,
you really have to try this.

992
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:58,476
Delicious, right?

993
00:48:00,729 --> 00:48:03,448
Don, Sloan.

994
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:05,900
What a coincidence
seeing you together.

995
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:07,368
Not really.
The whole staff is here.

996
00:48:07,403 --> 00:48:09,287
It's a little bit more
unusual that you're here.

997
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:12,540
I'm a vice president at the seventh
largest media company in the world.

998
00:48:12,574 --> 00:48:14,792
- Wyatt thinks we're dating.
- You and him?

999
00:48:14,827 --> 00:48:16,878
- Me and you.
- Are you serious?

1000
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:19,047
- Yep.
- Don and me?

1001
00:48:19,081 --> 00:48:21,249
Have you Googled
my romantic history?

1002
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,167
I date guys called
Mr. Chairman.

1003
00:48:23,218 --> 00:48:24,502
I date first round draft picks,

1004
00:48:24,504 --> 00:48:26,170
high second round
if it's a skill position.

1005
00:48:26,221 --> 00:48:28,389
You think I'm dating the EP
of a 10:00 PM newscast

1006
00:48:28,424 --> 00:48:31,259
that barely outrates
a rerun of <i>Just Shoot Me</i>?

1007
00:48:32,478 --> 00:48:35,730
I absolutely do.
And I'm gonna nail you.

1008
00:48:35,764 --> 00:48:37,265
Charlie wants to see
everyone in the kitchen

1009
00:48:37,316 --> 00:48:39,650
in the west end of the
building in five minutes.

1010
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:41,652
Okay.

1011
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:43,688
See ya.

1012
00:48:46,575 --> 00:48:49,861
- Was that too much before?
- That was way, way too much.

1013
00:48:51,363 --> 00:48:52,864
Excuse me.

1014
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:55,083
Excuse me,
do you happen to have any Schweppes Bitter Lemon?

1015
00:48:55,117 --> 00:48:56,701
- Yes, ma'am.
- You have Schweppes?

1016
00:48:56,703 --> 00:48:58,086
It's Canada Dry, I think.

1017
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,204
My boss has to have Schweppes.

1018
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:02,924
Do you happen to know if there's a
nearby liquor store or a grocery store?

1019
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,208
I think you'd have
to ask someone else.

1020
00:49:04,259 --> 00:49:06,294
They can carbonate lemon juice.

1021
00:49:06,345 --> 00:49:07,762
Your boss won't know
the difference.

1022
00:49:07,796 --> 00:49:10,214
- He will.
- He sounds like a dream come true.

1023
00:49:10,265 --> 00:49:12,633
- He's actually a...
- Charlie Skinner?

1024
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,719
- Mr. Pruit.
- Lucas.

1025
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,021
You're the man
I've been waiting for.

1026
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,473
I looked for you
in the ballroom.

1027
00:49:18,524 --> 00:49:20,475
I had to step out for a
while to take a call.

1028
00:49:20,526 --> 00:49:22,226
- I knew I'd see you here.
- It's no problem.

1029
00:49:22,277 --> 00:49:24,028
I just looked for you
in the ballroom.

1030
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:25,696
- I'm sorry about that.
- No, no need.

1031
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:27,782
Like I said,
I had to take a call and I knew I'd see you here.

1032
00:49:27,816 --> 00:49:29,567
- Not a problem.
- What are you drinking?

1033
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:33,287
Unflavored Absolut Vodka with a
capful of Schweppes Bitter Lemon

1034
00:49:33,322 --> 00:49:34,739
poured over ice
in a rocks glass.

1035
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,624
They don't have
Schweppes Bitter Lemon.

1036
00:49:36,658 --> 00:49:39,877
It eludes me why that should ever be the case,
you know?

1037
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:42,747
- It just eludes me.
- I'll go out to a store.

1038
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:43,965
- Gwen.
- Yeah?

1039
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:45,833
I'm not insane.
Just enjoy the party.

1040
00:49:45,884 --> 00:49:47,919
Thank you.

1041
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:52,807
I don't think
she's gonna work out.

1042
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:54,559
We'll make sure our
refrigerators are stocked.

1043
00:49:54,593 --> 00:49:56,761
Leona told me I'd be meeting
you in the ballroom

1044
00:49:56,812 --> 00:49:59,263
and then I'd be talking
to you here at the party.

1045
00:49:59,314 --> 00:50:00,848
That was the plan.

1046
00:50:00,899 --> 00:50:02,984
But then, unfortunately,
I had to take a call...

1047
00:50:03,018 --> 00:50:05,570
Work related?
The call.

1048
00:50:07,189 --> 00:50:09,490
Was the call...

1049
00:50:09,525 --> 00:50:11,993
No, it was my daughter,
as a matter of fact.

1050
00:50:12,027 --> 00:50:13,778
So we've met and now we're here

1051
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:15,279
and I'm looking
forward to talking.

1052
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:17,782
As I understand it,
you're our last best hope

1053
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,283
for the network
to stay on the air.

1054
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:22,453
If I was a man with no choices,
I'd kill myself.

1055
00:50:22,504 --> 00:50:25,673
Well, I guess that means I have a choice,
so...

1056
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:28,042
Would you like to talk about
my intentions for the network?

1057
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:30,845
Yes, sir, I would.

1058
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,051
My name is Lilly.

1059
00:51:10,085 --> 00:51:12,003
- Pleased to meet you.
- You're MacKenzie?

1060
00:51:12,054 --> 00:51:14,005
ACN.

1061
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,674
You're the one who decides
if and when to air a story?

1062
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:19,844
I'm sorry,
can I ask what this is about?

1063
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:21,729
I spoke to someone
who works for you.

1064
00:51:21,763 --> 00:51:23,397
About what?

1065
00:51:25,267 --> 00:51:27,518
I spoke to Neal.

1066
00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:37,411
- Are you saying...
- I'm the source.

1067
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:48,039
Prove that.

1068
00:51:49,841 --> 00:51:52,927
38 people died in a riot in Kundu
because of disinformation we planted.

1069
00:51:52,961 --> 00:51:55,379
- Okay.
- Three of them...

1070
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:58,299
- I sent Neal 27,000...
- Stop talking.

1071
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:01,385
Let me tell you
what we're about.

1072
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:02,803
Let me tell you what I'm about.

1073
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:05,439
Disruption.

1074
00:52:05,474 --> 00:52:06,557
I can see fear in your eyes.

1075
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,359
There almost always is.

1076
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:11,812
What's an example of disruption as
it would apply to a news network?

1077
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:14,615
User-generated content.
Crowdsourcing the news.

1078
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:17,234
I'll tell you, Lucas,
we just had in Boston...

1079
00:52:17,286 --> 00:52:20,237
Boston was a bad instance
of crowdsourcing,

1080
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:21,572
but it was still disruption.

1081
00:52:21,574 --> 00:52:24,125
Why one channel?
Why not 500?

1082
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:25,660
With no cost for content.

1083
00:52:25,711 --> 00:52:28,045
No cost for content
on the other 499?

1084
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,582
- I'm just trying...
- I'm not talking about guys with head-cams in Syria.

1085
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,802
I don't know. Maybe I am.
A disaster channel.

1086
00:52:34,836 --> 00:52:36,837
A stalker channel.
I just did three. Now you.

1087
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:40,308
A channel where professionals
investigate and report the news.

1088
00:52:40,342 --> 00:52:42,927
Danny Glover just came to mind.

1089
00:52:42,978 --> 00:52:44,762
We could have a channel

1090
00:52:44,764 --> 00:52:47,398
devoted to people who
are stalking Danny Glover.

1091
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:49,433
- You think I'm kidding.
- No, I don't.

1092
00:52:49,435 --> 00:52:53,070
- They're gathering.
- Thanks.

1093
00:52:53,105 --> 00:52:54,989
I have to step away
for a few minutes,

1094
00:52:55,023 --> 00:52:56,991
but I'm looking forward
to talking more about this.

1095
00:52:57,025 --> 00:52:59,026
No, you're not,
but you will anyway.

1096
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:01,696
Yeah.

1097
00:53:07,786 --> 00:53:11,589
You're at a party with nothing but
reporters and government officials.

1098
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:13,624
They don't know
they're looking for me.

1099
00:53:13,675 --> 00:53:15,209
Why hasn't the story aired yet?

1100
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,963
You said we.
"We planted disinformation."

1101
00:53:18,965 --> 00:53:20,631
- You work for BCD?
- Yeah.

1102
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:22,633
They're looking for someone
inside the Pentagon.

1103
00:53:22,684 --> 00:53:24,435
When is the story running?

1104
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:26,887
- It's going to be reported.
- It's been a week.

1105
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:29,640
We promised some people
we'd hold a moment.

1106
00:53:29,691 --> 00:53:33,728
- The government.
- We have to work with them on national security.

1107
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:37,064
They're gonna tell you
everything is national security.

1108
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:40,818
Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday.

1109
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:43,571
If I don't see the story
on your air by Wednesday,

1110
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:45,990
- I'm uploading it myself.
- You can't do that.

1111
00:53:45,992 --> 00:53:47,575
I'll just dump it
on Gwyneth Paltrow's blog.

1112
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:49,410
We don't know everything
that's in it yet.

1113
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:51,579
We have to work
with the government.

1114
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:54,749
I don't like that you're
working with the government.

1115
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,751
We don't want to get
people killed.

1116
00:53:56,802 --> 00:53:58,636
What about...

1117
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,514
What about them?

1118
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:14,735
<i>A lot of people
are sacrificing for you.</i>

1119
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,822
I expect your
cooperation in return.

1120
00:54:17,856 --> 00:54:21,075
You'll have my cooperation
for 96 hours.

1121
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:23,444
That should give you the time
to do what you need to do.

1122
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:25,362
- Mac.
- Yeah?

1123
00:54:25,364 --> 00:54:27,698
Charlie's gathering everyone in the
kitchen on the west side of the building.

1124
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:29,617
Okay.

1125
00:54:35,874 --> 00:54:37,708
The man had made his peace
with the end of the world.

1126
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:39,844
- Hi.
- Did you know the interview was gonna be like that?

1127
00:54:39,878 --> 00:54:42,513
- Um, Mr. McAvoy.
- That's not what we were expecting, was it, Maggie?

1128
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:45,850
- No.
- After 20 years at the EPA... Hi...

1129
00:54:45,884 --> 00:54:48,886
400 parts per million was about all
his sense of logic could handle

1130
00:54:48,888 --> 00:54:50,771
- <i>and his mind packed up.</i>
<i>- I saw the interview, too.</i>

1131
00:54:50,806 --> 00:54:53,057
<i>When we went to commercial,
I asked him if he'd changed his behavior at all.</i>

1132
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:55,025
- <i>He said he stopped buying lottery tickets.</i>
- Mr. McAvoy.

1133
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,778
- I understand his frustration.
- Sir!

1134
00:55:04,402 --> 00:55:07,071
Guys, I'm sorry,
could you give me just a second?

1135
00:55:07,122 --> 00:55:09,824
<i>I'm here all night.
Just a second.</i>

1136
00:55:17,632 --> 00:55:19,967
That's a subpoena in your pocket,
right?

1137
00:55:21,086 --> 00:55:22,887
Sir, my name is Eli Shapiro.

1138
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:24,472
I work for the US
Department of Justice.

1139
00:55:24,506 --> 00:55:26,974
- They sent an intern.
- I'm Rebecca Halliday.

1140
00:55:27,008 --> 00:55:29,143
- You're supposed to give that to me.
- Oh.

1141
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:31,762
Uh, Mr. Mc...

1142
00:55:33,231 --> 00:55:35,766
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- Go ahead. Don't be nervous.

1143
00:55:35,817 --> 00:55:38,986
Mr. McAvoy,
this is a subpoena for you to be sworn in

1144
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,573
before an investigative grand
jury at 1 St. Andrew's Plaza,

1145
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:45,109
Monday,
April 29 at 10:00 AM.

You think it's possible I'm not
as big a TV star as I thought?
