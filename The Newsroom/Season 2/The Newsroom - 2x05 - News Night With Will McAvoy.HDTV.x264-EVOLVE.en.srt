1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:01,785
People are mad at him, Charlie.

2
00:00:01,808 --> 00:00:03,358
<i>There are boycotts
and protesters,</i>

3
00:00:03,382 --> 00:00:05,049
- <i>but that's not the point.</i>
- What is the point?

4
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:07,468
The point is I'm not
who I used to be right now.

5
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:11,025
Did you give away
an interview with Romney?

6
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:13,726
<i>You know exactly how fucked up
it is that you gave it away.</i>

7
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:16,003
<i>And that you gave it to
a girl that you like.</i>

8
00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:19,109
Your father was an abusive alcoholic?
He hit you?

9
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:22,279
Look, he didn't hit anybody
once I was old enough to hit him back.

10
00:00:22,302 --> 00:00:23,500
What do we do now?

11
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,624
A preposterous stroke of luck
has to occur.

12
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:27,673
A guy down at OWS
was telling a campfire story

13
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:29,880
about working for an NGO.

14
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,264
He wrote a report that said US troops
were using chemical weapons.

15
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,607
- What happened to her in Africa?
- Will. <i>She went out on a story.</i>

16
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:37,254
It got real very fast and
she came back a little messed up.

17
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:39,027
She'd better get un-messed up
in a hurry.

18
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:40,911
If what happened to her
happened to you,

19
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:42,849
You would sit in the middle of a room
and cry forever.

20
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:45,121
- Maggie?
- You're back.

00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:36,082
Good evening.
I'm Will McAvoy.

32
00:02:36,184 --> 00:02:37,584
And this is <i>News Night</i>.

33
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:39,386
New developments in Sanford,
Florida,

34
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:42,556
in the investigation into
the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

35
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:45,325
Jurors have reached a verdict today
in the case of Dharun Ravi,

36
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:48,436
a Rutgers student accused of spying on
his roommate with a web-cam.

37
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,196
And we'll return
to the campaign trail,

38
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:52,298
but we start with news
from the Pentagon.

39
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,865
Today, for the first time,

40
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,901
the military identified the soldier...

41
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:58,304
- Breaking.
- What is it?

42
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:00,639
- Syria.
- ...Staff Sergeant Robert Bales,

43
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,741
a 38-year-old
father of two.

44
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:04,242
<i>But the released
Sergeant Bales...</i>

45
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:06,211
Two bombs have
exploded in Damascus.

46
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,580
They were detonated simultaneously
near government buildings.

47
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,515
Right now authorities
are confirming 16 dead

48
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:12,383
and 45 injured,
but those numbers are expected to rise.

49
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,051
- Rebels?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,786
- Do you know that or are you guessing?
- I'm guessing.

51
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:17,922
Buy the footage and set up a window.
We'll slide Tyler Clementi.

52
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:19,757
We go now to Bethany Lee
at the Pentagon.

53
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:22,926
The State Department.
Excuse me, the Pentagon. Bethany.

54
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:25,962
Will? I mean, Will.
Sorry, Will.

55
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,531
My dad called my cell
during the roll-in.

56
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:29,499
Like he fucking doesn't know
where I'm at at 8:00.

57
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,501
And, Mac, switch me,
God damn it.

58
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:34,438
- I don't want to say this shit in front of the control room.
- Switch him.

59
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,772
<i>...last Sunday
walked into two nearby villages</i>

60
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:38,941
<i>and there shot or stabbed
16 people,</i>

61
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,343
<i>nine of them children.</i>

62
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:43,112
What kind of military record
did Sergeant Bales have?

63
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:45,581
According to his lawyer,
he had an exemplary military record.

64
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:47,082
<i>I'm not gonna fire you.</i>

65
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:48,917
<i>She just told you
that it's not her.</i>

66
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,919
And I just told her
that I'm not gonna fire her--

67
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,455
- She's got a contract. What are you talking about?
- I'm glad you brought that up.

68
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,190
- "The Anchor shall not commit any act..."
- It was Photoshopped.

69
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,192
It's her head
on another woman's body.

70
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:59,128
"...into public disrepute,
contempt, scandal, or ridicule,

71
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:00,796
which might tend to reflect
unfavorably on the network..."

72
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:02,430
She doesn't need to hear
her morals clause!

73
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:05,167
"...any sponsor of the program,
or any stations broadcasting the program."

74
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:07,302
Congratulations,
you checked all the boxes.

75
00:04:07,403 --> 00:04:08,570
- Are you deaf?
- Charlie.

76
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,571
She just told you it's not her body,
Reese.

77
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:14,175
Then she needs to stop wearing
that fucking necklace, Charlie.

78
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:16,710
It's the same one
she's wearing in the pictures.

79
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:19,113
<i>The images have been
scrutinized by not one,</i>

80
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:22,416
but three graphic experts
who have reached identical conclusions.

81
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:24,785
Skin coloring is a match.
The shadows are a match.

82
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:26,319
Is there a blending issue?
No.

83
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,855
The hue is a match.
Pixelation is consistent throughout.

84
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:30,356
Resolution is consistent
throughout.

85
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,893
- <i>The size of the luma key--</i>
- Stop. It's me.

86
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:35,695
I lied.
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:37,831
Yeah.

88
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:42,935
Yeah?

89
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:45,437
Hang on.

90
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:50,405
Excuse me for a second.

91
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,626
- He's here?
- He's in the lobby.

92
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,059
There are people here.

93
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:00,418
Go down there and take him
somewhere until I say come up.

94
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,753
- You sure?
- Yeah, just take him somewhere.

95
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:08,759
- Sorry.
- Sloan, this wasn't a stalker

96
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:11,262
pointing a camera
through a peephole.

97
00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:13,230
- You posed for these.
- So what?

98
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:15,098
<i>- I understand.</i>
<i>- I didn't hear you.</i>

99
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,035
I understand.
I was seeing a man over Christmas--

100
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:20,670
- You don't have to explain.
- I can't tell you how much I wish that were true.

101
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:24,107
But she has to explain enough for me
to be satisfied there aren't more of these out there.

102
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:25,943
There are more.

103
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:28,478
Colonel, yesterday
President Karzai went to visit

104
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,280
the families of the victims
of Sergeant Bales' attack.

105
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:35,051
- Yes.
- And today he spoke with President Obama...

106
00:05:35,152 --> 00:05:36,352
The Syria feed is coming in.

107
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:37,920
Bars and tone are
a couple seconds away.

108
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:40,056
Put it up on a monitor
and dij it straight into the system.

109
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:42,992
- Copy that.
<i>...speaking mainly to a domestic audience.</i>

110
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,327
I'm sorry, Colonel,
I'm not clear how Karzai's remarks

111
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:47,229
could have been intended
for a domestic audience

112
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,999
when he was speaking on a secure phone
to the President of the United States.

113
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,001
- Syria's up. Right there.
<i>- A phone call that included</i>

114
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,171
<i>senior members of both administrations,
Will.</i>

115
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,439
Can you write some copy
and keep it under 90 seconds?

116
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,541
I'll start to triage
the bottom of the show.

117
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:08,949
- Are you doing anything?
- Yeah.

118
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,851
- Remind me.
- I'm waiting for an e-mail alert

119
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:12,519
- from the Seminole County Sheriff's Department.
- Right.

120
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,355
- You sure?
- I just forgot, Maggie.

121
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:15,722
- Tess.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

122
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:17,656
I just sent you bullets
on the two bombs in Damascus.

123
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:19,158
We need to keep it
under 90 seconds.

124
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,227
You know the body counts
are all over the place.

125
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:24,063
Some are saying it's 15 and some are saying it's 100.
You want to be that fuzzy?

126
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:25,664
Write it,
hope that the numbers firm up

127
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:27,533
in the next 45 minutes,
and hope it's closer to 15.

128
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,369
<i>- Jim.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

129
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:31,670
We've got a situation.
There's a Syrian woman on the phone with me right now.

130
00:06:31,772 --> 00:06:33,738
She's calling from
the W Hotel in Midtown.

131
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,340
She says her husband's
trapped underneath.

132
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:36,841
- One of the buildings?
- Yeah.

133
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:39,477
My name is Jim Harper, ma'am.

134
00:06:39,578 --> 00:06:42,381
- <i>Are you the one in charge?</i>
- I am. Can you tell me what's happening?

135
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:44,482
<i>My husband is alive
and trapped under the concrete.</i>

136
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,118
All right.
I understand.

137
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,787
<i>No one's try to rescue anyone.
He's alive.</i>

138
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:51,655
When was the last time you spoke
with your husband, Mrs. Kouri?

139
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:54,392
<i>Right now. He's on the phone.
He's calling me from under.</i>

140
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:57,361
- He's on the phone with you?
<i>- No one is coming to rescue anyone.</i>

141
00:06:57,462 --> 00:06:59,663
<i>Can you forward
that call to me?</i>

142
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:01,165
- Mrs. Kouri.
<i>- Yes?</i>

143
00:07:01,266 --> 00:07:03,667
Can you forward
that call to me?

144
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:06,602
You need to switch back to your husband's call,
go to your menu--

145
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:08,271
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Hello?

146
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,807
<i>- Hello, is someone there?</i>
- Mr. Kouri?

147
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:13,343
- <i>Yes, I'm here, thank God.</i>
- Sir, this is--

148
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:16,512
This is Jim Harper

00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:21,050
Your wife connected us.
Tell me about your condition.

151
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,986
<i>My leg is crushed
and I'm trapped.</i>

152
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:26,621
And that's inflamed
President Karzai's desire

153
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,958
to limit NATO troops
to major bases.

154
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:32,227
And he's also accused American officials,
President Karzai has,

155
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:35,931
<i>of not cooperating with a delegation
he'd sent to investigate the killings...</i>

156
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:37,999
A woman's on the phone
from the W.

157
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,335
She connected me to her husband,
who she says

158
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:42,903
is trapped under there,
who I've just spoken to.

159
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:46,007
They believe if it gets international coverage,
Assad will hurry up.

160
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,675
- The wife's at the W?
- Yeah.

161
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:50,311
- What did the husband say?
- He said, "Thank God."

162
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,413
You want to let me
do some good?

163
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,415
Just be right.

164
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,718
<i>Colonel Stanley Owlen,
spokesman for CENTCOM in Afghanistan.</i>

165
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,220
- <i>Thank you for joining us.</i>
<i>- Pleasure.</i>

166
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,089
We'll keep following this story

167
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,057
as the case of
Sergeant Bales continues.

168
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:06,226
This is <i>News Night</i>.
We'll be back right after this.

169
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:07,961
<i>- Out.</i>
- 2:30 back.

170
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:31,749
- What did your dad say?
- It wasn't my dad.

171
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,585
It was the guy who called the ambulance.
He was using my dad's phone.

172
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:36,888
- What happened?
- I don't know, it sounds like he collapsed.

173
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:38,589
Yes, please,
in Lincoln, the number

174
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,791
for the St. Elizabeth
Regional Medical Center.

175
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:43,093
- And if you could connect me, that would be--
- Jesus.

176
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:44,928
Yeah, one of the hands
took his phone and called me.

177
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,697
I was the emergency contact.
1,500 miles away.

178
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:49,466
Good evening.
I'm looking for John McAvoy.

179
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,369
He was brought into ER about--
He should have just been brought in.

180
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,071
- Thank you.
- What do you think happened?

181
00:08:54,172 --> 00:08:57,340
7:00 Central Time?
I think he was helping to bring in the cows,

182
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:59,642
which you're not supposed
to do when you're 150 years--

183
00:08:59,743 --> 00:09:01,944
Yes, I'm calling
about John McAvoy.

184
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:04,547
He was brought in a few minutes ago.
This is his son Will.

185
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:06,849
- What do you need?
- I just need to ask him about something

186
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,518
- someone posted on Twitter.
- Can it wait?

187
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,053
- Yeah.
- Neal, hang on.

188
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:11,620
You think if I called
back after 9:00--

189
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:13,621
I'm sorry, 8:00 your time--
If I call back after 8:00,

190
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:15,357
I might be able
to speak to him?

191
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,359
I appreciate it.
Thanks.

192
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,295
It's all right.
They think he may have had a mild heart attack.

193
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:22,030
He's responding
to a clot dissolving agent

194
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:23,765
and they got him in cardio
running some tests.

195
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:25,567
Little mo' cardio.
It's fine.

196
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:27,635
- What do you want to do?
- Whatever's next in the rundown.

197
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:29,437
- What do you got, Neal?
- Some bullshit on--

198
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:31,573
<i>- 60 seconds.</i>
- 60 seconds. Some bullshit on Twitter.

199
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:33,507
- What did I do?
- I'll take care of it.

200
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:35,109
What?!

201
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:39,412
@PepperBurke says--
I guess maybe

202
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,481
you were cold to her
in a restaurant at lunch.

203
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,650
I have absolutely no idea
who @PepperBurke is.

204
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,151
- She's a writer for--
- I don't care.

205
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,853
- Is this an emergency?
- No.

206
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:49,756
Then I don't care.
Clear the studio.

207
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,064
Don't wait for the show
to come down to call him.

208
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,883
The race for the Republican
presidential nomination...

209
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,852
<i>He consults for AIG</i>

210
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,187
and we'd been seeing
each other about six weeks.

211
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:26,390
And he got a suite at the Mandarin Oriental
for Christmas Eve.

212
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,391
- <i>I bought him a camera-- A nice--</i>
- All right.

213
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:30,127
A camera,
and we'd been drinking

214
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:34,164
and he wanted me to pose and,
you know, I did.

215
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:36,867
For fun.
Just for us.

216
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:39,003
Last night I broke up with him.

217
00:10:39,104 --> 00:10:40,570
Have you heard of this
website RevengePorn?

218
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:42,339
I have now.

219
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,741
Why can't she file for injunctive relief
and get the pictures down?

220
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:46,643
The pictures are everywhere.
They have their own Facebook page.

221
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:49,512
- Then she sues for defamation.
- She posed for the pictures.

222
00:10:49,613 --> 00:10:51,014
- Copyright.
- It was his camera.

223
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:52,849
She gave it to him.
He owns the pictures

224
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,018
and it doesn't look to me like
she was doing anything against her will.

225
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,686
I wasn't.

226
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:01,657
- Are you on TV tonight?
- Yeah, in about two hours.

227
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,861
You're trending number one,
Sloan.

228
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:09,665
What do you want to do?

229
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,903
Vice President Biden was in Toledo, Ohio,
today speaking to the UAW...

230
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:17,538
- Neal.
- Yeah?

231
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:19,040
Can you unblock
a number for me?

232
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:21,308
- You can do it.
- How?

233
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,443
By listening when I
taught you how to do it.

234
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:25,479
Transfer the call to my line.

235
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,548
Alim, are you still with me?
Samirah?

236
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:29,249
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- I'm still here.</i>

237
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,718
We're working with authorities,
so hang in there and breathe.

238
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:34,721
<i>- All right.</i>
- Okay.

239
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:36,656
<i>He talked up
the American auto industry,</i>

240
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:38,391
<i>praised the president's
convictions,</i>

241
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:42,128
<i>and repeatedly criticized
the Republican candidates by name,</i>

242
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:44,597
<i>accusing them of being out
to protect the privileged.</i>

243
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,832
<i>Our philosophy,</i>

244
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:49,601
<i>ours is one that values
the workers</i>

245
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:52,004
<i>and the success of a business.</i>

246
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:55,607
<i>It values the middle class
and the success of our economy.</i>

247
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:59,144
<i>Simply stated, we're about
promoting the private sector.</i>

248
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:00,779
Jim, it's in.

249
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,082
<i>They're about protecting
the privileged sector.</i>

250
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,983
- Download it.
- I'm sorry?

251
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,086
- Download it.
- Download what?

252
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,788
- The 911 tapes.
- What does download mean?

253
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:12,623
- Maggie.
- It's downloading.

254
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:16,293
How long is the tape?

255
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:17,862
Four minutes and seven seconds.

256
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,362
How long does
that take to download?

257
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:20,463
It really depends.

258
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:29,539
All I want in the world
is for you

259
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,142
to be standing
over my shoulder for the next 99%.

260
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:33,607
You're in luck.

261
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:35,677
- Neal.
- Yeah?

262
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:38,948
Shit. I thought
he was in a package.

263
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,117
I'm in the shot.
All right, just be cool.

264
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,919
- Okay, you first.
- Can you-- Shut up.

265
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,855
- Can you block the site?
- I already did.

266
00:12:45,956 --> 00:12:47,790
- In the office?
- Yeah. Why, can you block it everywhere?

267
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:49,024
- No.
- I didn't know.

268
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:50,126
How could I block it
everywhere?

269
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,559
You said-- Never mind.

270
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,027
Did you know there's
an organization called

271
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,396
The Righteous Daughters
of Jihadi Excellence?

272
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:57,265
No.

273
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:10,477
What was that?

274
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:12,512
WorldNetDaily has
a reputable source

275
00:13:12,613 --> 00:13:15,415
saying Simon Weingarden
may have once accepted a speaking fee

276
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:17,684
from The Righteous Daughters
of Jihadi Excellence.

277
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:20,788
You wouldn't have to pay me;
I'd give anything to speak at one of those meetings.

278
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:22,289
Keeping in mind
that WorldNetDaily

279
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,190
reported that Obama
murdered his gay lover--

280
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,925
No, he didn't murder him,
he had him murdered.

281
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:27,726
And it wasn't his gay lover,
it was his husband.

282
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:29,695
- So they got other facts wrong, too?
- Yeah.

283
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:31,463
Keeping that in mind,
what do you think

284
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:33,732
WorldNetDaily considers
a reputable source?

285
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,902
In this case? Me.

286
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:38,237
I need to make a call.

287
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:02,259
While the president struck
a somewhat sarcastic tone,

288
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:04,128
the vice president
pulled no punches,

289
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:05,730
perhaps offering
a preview of the--

290
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,398
Philip, it's Don Keefer.

291
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,201
I just read a story on WND

292
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:12,502
blind quoting a source
who says Weingarden spoke

293
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,771
to The Righteous Daughters
of Jihadi Excellence,

294
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,873
and that group sounded
oddly familiar to me.

295
00:14:16,974 --> 00:14:18,642
Could you call me back
at the office?

296
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:20,310
And if you call between 10:00 and 11:00,
tell them I said

297
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,479
to put you through to the control room.
We gotta fix this.

298
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:25,882
- What happened?
- Jesus!

299
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:28,150
I'm sorry.
I'm down here.

300
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,587
It's all right.

301
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:40,363
What are you doing?

302
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:43,431
Just hanging out.
Grant's in my office. Our office.

303
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:46,033
You shouldn't be sharing
an office anymore.

304
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:47,602
I don't mind.

305
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:50,572
I like Grant
and he's usually in DC.

306
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:52,707
Brings his dog in sometimes.

307
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,843
Basset hound.
Always looks very puzzled.

308
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:56,411
Just confounded.

309
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:59,146
But working on it, you know?

310
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:01,548
Just everybody slow down

311
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:04,385
and let me catch up
'cause I'm down here.

312
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:11,825
There was no way
to see this coming.

313
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:14,762
He was a really nice guy.

314
00:15:15,616 --> 00:15:17,319
Totally trusted him.

315
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,201
It's all right.

316
00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:36,147
<i>...allowed to vote
in partisan primaries,</i>

317
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:38,750
<i>but not in presidential
elections.</i>

318
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:41,286
It's because everyone's downloading
at the same time.

319
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:42,987
Yeah.

320
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,558
Hey, I read Hallie's
column yesterday.

321
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,927
- On Sandra Fluke?
- That chick can write.

322
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:51,729
I'll tell her you said so.

323
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,489
She knows who I am?

324
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:55,884
Sure. Yeah.

325
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:57,963
Why wouldn't she?

326
00:15:57,986 --> 00:15:59,882
I don't know.

327
00:15:59,906 --> 00:16:02,254
She does.

328
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:04,006
- How did it come up?
- You?

329
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:06,008
I'm just curious.

330
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:08,144
I don't know.
I'm sure I mentioned you

331
00:16:08,245 --> 00:16:10,079
when I was on the bus with her.
Talked about everybody.

332
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,448
Well, tell her
she's been on fire lately.

333
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:13,616
It's not hard to light her on fire
with Sandra Fluke.

334
00:16:13,717 --> 00:16:15,919
- She ain't the only one.
- Yeah.

335
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:19,155
What do you mean?

336
00:16:19,256 --> 00:16:21,122
You don't think there's
a little phony outrage?

337
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:23,625
- Really?
- Just a little? Little bit?

338
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:25,527
No.

339
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,295
A little of the ol',
"Hey, how do you do?"

340
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:29,097
A little,
"Hey, how's your uncle?"

341
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,633
Texas two-step,
refried beans, nothin'?

342
00:16:33,436 --> 00:16:35,536
You think anyone else
is getting it faster?

343
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:37,638
Is everyone downloading it
at the same speed

344
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:39,239
or is CNN on the air
with it already?

345
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,308
Gary, is anyone up yet
with the 911 tape?

346
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,143
No.

347
00:16:43,244 --> 00:16:46,848
Anyway, I was glad
for Hallie's piece about Sandra Fluke.

348
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:49,617
And the two pieces that came before that
about Sandra Fluke.

349
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:52,051
And I'm looking forward to her upcoming series
"White Men, I Think I Hate Them."

350
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:53,319
She writes about
women's issues.

351
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,721
- Sexism.
- It's in the news right now.

352
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:56,556
You say that
like we can't help it.

353
00:16:56,657 --> 00:16:58,358
What can I tell you?
I hit send, it's in the news.

354
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:00,460
Would you prefer
nobody wrote about it?

355
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,462
No, but can I show you
something?

356
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,230
I didn't read it on her blog.

357
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:05,899
It was picked up
by <i>The Huffington Post</i>.

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,100
She was very happy about that.

359
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:09,101
And look,
to get to Hallie's piece

360
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,803
about the epidemic of sexism,

361
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,105
<i>you have to scroll past
two stories on side boobs,</i>

362
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:16,074
<i>"Six Things You Never
Should Say To a Woman With Big Boobs,"</i>

363
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:19,244
"Alicia Keys' Nip Slip,"
"Britney's Nip Slip," "This Week In Nip Slips,"

364
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:22,180
and "Scarlett Johansson's
Busty Red Carpet Look a Distraction."

365
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:23,681
A distraction from what,
they never say.

366
00:17:23,782 --> 00:17:26,484
I think they were busy
looking for sexism.

367
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,786
Can you go back
to the download?

368
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:33,992
17%.

369
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:37,428
Polls close
at 8:00 P.M. Eastern

370
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,397
<i>and our full coverage begins
at 5:00 here on ACN.</i>

371
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:42,298
<i>We'll be back after this.</i>

372
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,834
<i>- We're out.</i>
<i>- Three minutes back.</i>

373
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,435
<i>Yeah, we're clear.</i>

374
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,371
You wanted me?

375
00:17:48,472 --> 00:17:51,608
What's the Twitter problem
you started to talk to me about?

376
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:54,044
It seemed like Mac
really didn't want me to bother you with it.

377
00:17:54,145 --> 00:17:55,745
She doesn't get
to make that decision.

378
00:17:55,846 --> 00:17:57,880
So please just tell me
before she walks in here.

379
00:17:57,981 --> 00:18:00,650
You ran into a woman in a restaurant at lunch,
Pepper Burke.

380
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:02,885
- I don't know who that is.
- She writes for the <i>Post</i>.

381
00:18:02,986 --> 00:18:04,987
- What did I do?
- It sounds like you didn't recognize her.

382
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:08,724
- I'm sure that's true.
- "@WillMcAvoy blew me off at Smith&Wol." Steak?

383
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:10,927
- Have you got the next packet?
<i>- I didn't blow her off.</i>

384
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:12,427
"I was carrying two coffees.

385
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:14,195
Must have thought
I was a waitress.

386
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:17,732
He's not who he thinks he is,
but exactly who we think he is."

387
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,501
Neal, a woman walked up to me

388
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:22,003
as I was leaving
and said hello.

389
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:24,940
And I said hello.
What in the fuck?!

390
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:27,175
- What you got, Sampat?
- Nothing.

391
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:29,142
- A woman on Twitter--
- God damn it.

392
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:30,611
Can we please settle
who my boss is?

393
00:18:30,712 --> 00:18:32,446
- It's me. It's him.
- It's me. It's me.

394
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:34,347
A woman says I snubbed her
in a restaurant.

395
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:36,383
Should we try to get that
into the D block?

396
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:38,652
- How many followers does she have?
- It doesn't matter.

397
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,487
- She's got a few.
- And retweets?

398
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:43,090
- Sure, and it was also picked up by BuzzFeed.
- Come on!

399
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:46,092
It should be obvious to you by now
that fundamentally small people

400
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,995
are going to try to raise their profile
by standing on your neck.

401
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,697
Could we have a second?

402
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:52,599
- Sure, yeah. But then I need you.
- I'll be right there.

403
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,668
- In the next break, we're composing a response.
- Neal.

404
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,370
I don't get paid any extra
when this happens,

405
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:01,239
and it happens all the time
and it's always me.

406
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,008
<i>One minute.</i>

407
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,010
I was polite to her.
I swear to God.

408
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,945
Turn off your mic pack.

409
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,886
Nothing bad is gonna happen
if you're kind to him right now.

410
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,356
On the other hand,
if you make the other choice and you're wrong,

411
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,826
you will never
be able to undo it.

412
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,460
That's a scientific fact.

413
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:26,029
I'm being kind, MacKenzie.
What do you want me to do?

414
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,298
- I'm supposed to call back at 9:00.
- Call his phone.

415
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:30,234
- He can't talk right now.
- Leave a message for him.

416
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,868
Just show him you called.
He'll freak.

417
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,837
- I'm in the middle of--
- In the next break.

418
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,240
He and I need to talk,
not just a message.

419
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,842
I know that,
but start with a message

420
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:41,977
so when it gets to the talk,
it doesn't start with, "Why didn't you call me?"

421
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:43,679
I'll do it in the next break.

422
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,182
Good.

423
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:50,153
I really do think
tonight is one of those nights

424
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:52,655
when you should just do
everything I tell you to do.

425
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:55,524
How exactly would that
be different from every other--

426
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,425
30 seconds.

427
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:04,566
You're like his drug dealer
on this stuff.

428
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,434
The right response
might not be a bad idea.

429
00:20:06,536 --> 00:20:07,935
It's gonna keep going
for 24 hours.

430
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:09,904
She's gonna have to become a star
by doing something

431
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:12,473
- or sleeping with someone.
- I wanted you to see something.

432
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:15,042
- When Pepper Burke tweeted--
- I'm gonna kill you tonight.

433
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:17,378
No, this isn't that.
She used the hashtag <i>News Night</i>.

434
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,446
So I was looking at other tweets
with our hashtag

435
00:20:19,548 --> 00:20:22,983
and this one was posted six minutes ago
from our hair and makeup room.

436
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:29,522
Are you kidding me?

437
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:34,860
I'll talk to him when I can.

438
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:40,500
I know this isn't your fault,
but I really do hate you anyway.

439
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,968
I don't care that it's irrational.
It is what it is.

440
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,404
Tonight I root
for your failure.

441
00:20:48,007 --> 00:20:50,209
<i>In three, two...</i>

442
00:20:56,616 --> 00:20:59,283
Today the Obama administration
reaffirmed its commitment

443
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,319
<i>to a federal mandate
that women's health insurance plans...</i>

444
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,588
Thank you.
Get in here.

445
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:07,057
Charlie Skinner at ACN,
I will not help you with your sleeper cell.

446
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:08,959
- Get in.
- How you doing?

447
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,895
You really think you should
be spotted coming to see me?

448
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:14,298
I'm a press liaison for the ONI.
Why do you treat me like a secret agent?

449
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,998
- 'Cause you're a fucking secret agent.
- No.

450
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,900
- You know you are.
- I am not.

451
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,636
- You're a ghost.
- I work in public affairs at Naval Intelligence.

452
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:20,970
You're a fucking spook
and you know it.

453
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,772
I don't know if you're
with us or Mossad.

454
00:21:22,873 --> 00:21:24,574
- I'm not Mossad.
- I'm compromised now.

455
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:27,244
- You got anything to drink?
- Yeah.

456
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,446
And you know what else?
Every time you see me,

457
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,080
it's about something stupid.

458
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,581
<i>That's just hurtful.</i>

459
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:34,916
Everybody else comes
and says please,

460
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:36,918
report where
the missile landed,

461
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,420
but not where it was launched.

462
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:40,489
And that makes sense to me.

463
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,691
With you,
it's please don't report

464
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:45,561
that we're building a computer center
in the mountains of Utah.

465
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:46,995
That's not a stupid ask.

466
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:48,763
What do you care if people
know that the Navy's

467
00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:50,798
building a computer center
outside Provo?

468
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:52,800
- They might make fun of us.
- Why?

469
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:54,636
It's hot there in the summer
and computers get hot

470
00:21:54,737 --> 00:21:56,738
and people say we're stupid,
don't know what we're doing.

471
00:21:56,838 --> 00:21:59,774
When the truth is the Navy has an excellent
track record of knowing what it's doing.

472
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,842
We saw the potential
in Mav and Goose

473
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:04,311
and we sent them to Miramar,
which I don't think the Air Force would have done.

474
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:06,413
<i>And you've got the Roswell
crowd that's gonna say</i>

475
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:08,114
<i>it's a rec center
for Mormon aliens.</i>

476
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:10,216
- Is it?
- I've already said too much.

477
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:13,520
You've got four 25,000-square-foot rooms
full of servers,

478
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:16,456
1.7 million gallons
of coolant a day,

479
00:22:16,557 --> 00:22:18,892
and you want to hold
yottabytes of data.

480
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:21,860
I do not have
the first earthly idea

481
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:24,430
what a yottabyte of data is,
but the kids downstairs

482
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:27,900
tell me it's equal to 500
quintillion pages of text.

483
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:30,235
Did not know
what a quintillion was,

484
00:22:30,337 --> 00:22:32,471
so I found out and it's a lot.

485
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:35,040
Have our enemies produced

486
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:37,141
a yottabyte's worth of text?

487
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:38,710
Has the human race?

488
00:22:38,811 --> 00:22:41,112
Still, we'd rather not add

489
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:42,814
one more high-value target
to anyone's book.

490
00:22:42,915 --> 00:22:44,982
This may sound mean to say,

491
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,819
but if North Korea
is ranking targets,

492
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,788
I wouldn't mind
if the mountains of Utah

493
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:51,722
took the place of,
for instance, my house.

494
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:54,224
The world's not gonna
be ended by a bomb.

495
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:56,660
It's gonna be
a disgruntled kid.

496
00:22:56,761 --> 00:23:00,331
He's gonna hack into the grid,
open dams, canals, flood towns,

497
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:02,666
change pipeline pressures
to key oil and gas centers,

498
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:05,101
causing hellacious explosions
in populated areas.

499
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:07,403
How's Nancy?

500
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:10,239
She's finishing up
a book on Jackson.

501
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:11,641
And Sophie?

502
00:23:11,742 --> 00:23:13,008
She's in Amherst.

503
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:14,677
- <i>What's she majoring in?</i>
- Philosophy.

504
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:17,246
What do you do
with a philosophy degree?

505
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:21,050
It takes all the energy I have
not to ask that question at Thanksgiving.

506
00:23:24,387 --> 00:23:26,588
I don't give a shit
about the computers in Utah.

507
00:23:26,689 --> 00:23:28,323
Report whatever you want.

508
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,596
If you don't care,
what are you doing here?

509
00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:37,833
You've got a producer
at your DC bureau

510
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:41,517
named Jerry Dantana.

511
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,985
Yeah.

512
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:44,772
Why has he been spending
the last seven months

513
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:47,341
asking people about
a black op called Genoa?

514
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:53,748
I'm not here
for something stupid.

515
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:56,115
<i>A lion's walking
through the woods</i>

516
00:23:56,216 --> 00:23:57,617
and he comes up to a zebra

517
00:23:57,718 --> 00:24:00,152
and the lion says,
"You know something, zebra?

518
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:02,188
You are a ridiculous
looking animal.

519
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:05,091
You're half white, half black,
half horse, half donkey.

520
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:08,027
Look at me.
I'm rough, I'm tough,

521
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:09,562
I'm the king
of the jungle."

522
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:11,764
Zebra just shrugs and moves on.

523
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:13,932
Lion comes to a giraffe
and the lion says,

524
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,467
"You know something, giraffe?

525
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:17,870
You are a ridiculous
looking animal.

526
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,038
You've got a long neck
and little horns.

527
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:22,040
Look at me.
I'm rough, I'm tough,

528
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:23,642
I'm the king
of the jungle."

529
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:26,077
Lion comes to a frog and says,

530
00:24:26,178 --> 00:24:27,645
"You know something, frog?

531
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:29,714
You are a ridiculous
looking animal.

532
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:31,248
You're green and slimy."

533
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:33,818
And the frog says,
"Hey, fuck you. I've been sick."

534
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:37,588
You got to get your show ready.

535
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:39,089
I'm all right.

536
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,759
At some point,
I'm gonna have to call my parents.

537
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,894
Do you have to?

538
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:46,129
My father keeps
a scrapbook on me.

539
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,631
He Googles me every morning.

540
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:50,834
He's gonna understand.

541
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:53,236
- He will.
- Not deep down.

542
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:55,806
No one will.

543
00:24:55,907 --> 00:24:58,374
This is who I am now.

544
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:00,576
What happened?

545
00:25:00,677 --> 00:25:02,611
You mean how did he--

546
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:04,480
- Why did I pose?
- Was it a bad breakup?

547
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,749
I didn't even know you were
going out with someone.

548
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,984
He was a very
well-respected analyst.

549
00:25:09,085 --> 00:25:10,719
We met at a Forbes party.

550
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:12,455
No, I didn't think
it was a bad breakup.

551
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:14,623
He wasn't very upset about it.

552
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:17,659
But even if it had been,
like, this would be okay?

553
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,026
- No.
- What the fuck?

554
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:20,194
I know.

555
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:22,964
I am feeling
so intensely something

556
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,433
that I don't know what it is.

557
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:27,335
Rage.

558
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:29,804
You want me to scrap you
from the rundown?

559
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,738
- Yes.
- You're supposed to do a segment--

560
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,475
No, I'm not going on TV
and interviewing--

561
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,911
the guy is--
He's the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

562
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:39,513
You can't...

563
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:42,549
He should have Elliot.

564
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,485
Okay.

565
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:50,122
Excuse me.

566
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:57,363
I bought him the camera.

567
00:25:57,464 --> 00:25:59,565
It was a good camera.

568
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:02,334
I asked a couple of our
freelance guys for help.

569
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,836
I miss still photography.

570
00:26:04,937 --> 00:26:06,705
Though not so much lately.

571
00:26:11,844 --> 00:26:13,244
Philip, it's Don Keefer again.

572
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:15,013
You've got to call me.
This is a problem.

573
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:16,748
<i>Tomorrow morning,
everyone's gonna be sourcing</i>

574
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:18,917
<i>the WND story
that's sourcing you sourcing me.</i>

575
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,784
I have no idea
if Simon Weingarden

576
00:26:20,886 --> 00:26:22,419
would make a good
solicitor general or not,

577
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:23,754
or even if he's being
considered.

578
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:26,056
But he shouldn't have this
stapled to his resume

579
00:26:26,157 --> 00:26:28,692
just because I'm dry.

580
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:31,795
Call me, please, at any of my numbers.
They'll put you through.

581
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:35,132
What was that?

582
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:42,605
Anyway...

583
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:46,375
You're feeling rage.

584
00:26:46,476 --> 00:26:48,477
I'd love it if I was.

585
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,847
I'd give anything to feel rage.

586
00:26:50,948 --> 00:26:53,715
It'd trump the humiliation
and I'd be able to get up.

587
00:26:55,652 --> 00:26:56,885
I think I live here now.

588
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:58,253
What if I were able
to promise you

589
00:26:58,354 --> 00:27:00,422
that humiliation
always turns into rage?

590
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:02,524
How long does
that conversion take?

591
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:04,292
How long is the evolution?

592
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:06,061
How long does it take to get
from the larva stage--

593
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:08,663
- I fully understand what you're asking.
- How long does it take?

594
00:27:08,764 --> 00:27:10,665
I guess it depends.

595
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:12,967
Like with Germany,
it was 15 or 20 years.

596
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:15,502
- Forget it.
- But Wile E. Coyote,

597
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:17,872
you know, he...

598
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:19,907
He has a fast turnaround.

599
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,649
I want to die.

600
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:33,019
I know.

601
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,789
<i>We've seen a host of
contentious women's issues</i>

602
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,356
<i>in the news
including this one...</i>

603
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,758
As soon as you're done,
I'm gonna need it

604
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,993
so I can post
an unedited transcript.

605
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:42,695
Martin, Tess.

606
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:44,296
We're monitoring it.
Help is on the way.

607
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,298
You understand they want to
be able to raise awareness--

608
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,400
No, I understand.

609
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,540
I'll tell you
what column I'd write.

610
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:58,009
What's wrong with sluts?

611
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,411
I don't think that's her point.

612
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,314
It wasn't her point,
but it's mine.

613
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,650
Rush Limbaugh
called a woman a slut.

614
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,485
It's not hard for me
to get over that.

615
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,854
But now I have to ask
what's wrong with sluts?

616
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:13,023
That's a woman who has
a lot of casual sex with different guys.

617
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,158
Why isn't that good as long
as everybody's safe?

618
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:18,428
Because the country is divided
into people who like sex

619
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:21,732
and people who are
utterly creeped out by it.

620
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,533
I'm one of the sex people.

621
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,335
And I'm sure
we're in the majority

622
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,937
and I'm getting tired of having to
make a public bow to the minority

623
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:30,940
by pretending
I'm not really into sex.

624
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:39,515
You need to switch to vodka.

625
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,484
It's not as easy to smell

626
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:45,154
and you're wearing the same clothes
as you were yesterday.

627
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:47,280
Think I'm drunk right now?

628
00:28:47,303 --> 00:28:50,544
Last night.
Most nights.

629
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:54,229
What I do when
I leave here is none--

630
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,632
I know.

631
00:28:59,068 --> 00:29:01,536
Limbaugh is not
the interesting conversation.

632
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:02,903
He was wrong.

633
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:04,938
Sluts was the interesting
conversation.

634
00:29:07,643 --> 00:29:08,909
We'll have it in five minutes.

635
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,378
Another five or six
to cut and render it.

636
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,712
I need to know how much time.

637
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:13,013
I'll find out.

638
00:29:18,018 --> 00:29:19,886
- Gary.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

639
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:25,058
How long did it take you
to straighten out after Africa?

640
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:28,294
I wasn't holding the kid.

641
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:32,799
All right.

642
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:36,169
We live in a dangerous
time for freedom.

643
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:38,705
A time when it takes guts to speak out
for conservative values.

644
00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:40,972
I'll grant you that it takes guts
to speak out about anything.

645
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:42,741
<i>But does it take
something extra...</i>

646
00:29:42,842 --> 00:29:45,677
It's about five minutes away,
and then we'll have to cut it down from 4:07.

647
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:47,946
Okay.
Just 20 to 25 seconds will be cool.

648
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,815
If we can't get it right on time,
we can always slide it to 10:00.

649
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:51,282
- I want it for us.
- We may be squeezed.

650
00:29:51,383 --> 00:29:53,952
- Then we're squeezed.
- All right. We'll have it.

651
00:29:54,053 --> 00:29:55,587
...or Mr. Buchanan.

652
00:29:55,688 --> 00:29:57,988
But Rush Limbaugh has
the most popular show on the radio

653
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:00,390
and Pat Buchanan won
the New Hampshire primary.

654
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:03,194
What does someone who wants to
speak up about conservative values

655
00:30:03,294 --> 00:30:05,562
<i>have to fear in terms
of consequences?</i>

656
00:30:05,663 --> 00:30:07,464
Will, I'm not even sure
why we're talking about this.

657
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:09,666
It's because you said
it's a dangerous time for freedom.

658
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,435
A time when it takes
guts to speak out

659
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:13,336
for conservative values,
and then I took it from there.

660
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,106
Pat Buchanan was fired
from MSNBC.

661
00:30:16,207 --> 00:30:17,874
- Do you know why?
- I can take a guess.

662
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:19,876
Well, since you're on television,
I'd prefer you didn't.

663
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:21,778
It was absolutely
because of the book.

664
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:23,412
I guess you couldn't
help yourself.

665
00:30:23,513 --> 00:30:25,782
<i>You and I know
there's a chapter that's misunderstood.</i>

666
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:27,283
Tess, I'll be back in a second.

667
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:29,517
- Give him a warning at 30 out.
- Copy.

668
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,454
People widely
misunderstood a chapter in Pat's book.

669
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:34,723
- The chapter--
- "The End of White America."

670
00:30:34,824 --> 00:30:36,959
- Jesse?
- Yeah.

671
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,193
I'm Mac McHale, the producer.

672
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,328
That's such a news name.

673
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:42,397
"Well, you got moxie, kid.
And that's our lead.

674
00:30:42,498 --> 00:30:45,466
Kill the lead that was there before
and get me a ham sandwich."

675
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:49,036
So let me ask you
a couple of things.

676
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:51,139
You're the head of the Rutgers
Gay-Straight Alliance?

677
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,840
- Yes.
- Did you know Tyler?

678
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:54,541
No.

679
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:57,779
Will's gonna ask you about
the reaction to all this on campus.

680
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,846
You don't have to feel like
you're speaking for everyone,

681
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:01,581
just your own experience.

682
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:03,984
Obviously I thought
what Dharun Ravi did was reprehensible.

683
00:31:04,085 --> 00:31:06,253
He invaded Tyler's privacy
in the worst possible way

684
00:31:06,353 --> 00:31:08,255
and then made it available
for everyone to see.

685
00:31:08,355 --> 00:31:09,923
Do you think Dharun Ravi
is homophobic?

686
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:12,159
I have no idea.
I know he's an asshole.

687
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,427
You take the most intimate
moment of someone's life

688
00:31:14,528 --> 00:31:17,496
- and use it for entertainment?
- Right.

689
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:19,431
Right.

690
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:23,335
A woman who works for the <i>Post</i>

691
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:25,504
is mad at Will
for a perceived snub

692
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:28,540
and she's been tweeting about it
and that's why someone here

693
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:32,143
was looking at
the <i>News Night</i> hashtag.

694
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:35,146
"Watch #Newsnight 8:00 P.M.

695
00:31:35,247 --> 00:31:38,149
My TV debut.
Gonna make some waves.

696
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,153
♪Parentspleasedonthateme."

697
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:44,122
This was you, right?

698
00:31:44,223 --> 00:31:45,756
Yeah.
Just spreading the word.

699
00:31:45,858 --> 00:31:47,925
What kind of waves, Jesse?

700
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:53,163
Are you planning on
coming out on the show?

701
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:58,680
To my parents.

702
00:31:58,704 --> 00:32:00,876
I'm sorry, you can't.

703
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,261
Why?

704
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:05,407
You just said you can't
take the most intimate moment

705
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:07,043
of someone's life
and use it for entertainment.

706
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:08,510
But I'm volunteering
to do that.

707
00:32:08,611 --> 00:32:10,012
- I signed a release.
- You can't do it.

708
00:32:10,113 --> 00:32:11,747
If I hadn't told you,
you wouldn't have known.

709
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:14,050
If you hadn't tweeted about it
and you hadn't told me,

710
00:32:14,151 --> 00:32:15,985
I wouldn't have known,
but you did and I do.

711
00:32:16,086 --> 00:32:18,020
What's wrong with it?
As long as I'm okay with it.

712
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:19,655
It's just not
that kind of show.

713
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:22,423
- We'll be back after this.
- What kind of show?

714
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,826
The kind where
that would happen.

715
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:27,795
We just went to commercial
and I'll be right back.

716
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:29,264
We have to talk about this,
okay?

717
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,732
You can't just pretend
I didn't say anything?

718
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,500
No.

719
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:37,514
She knew what she was doing
when she said you must have

720
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:38,758
thought she was a waitress.

721
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:40,374
- People are tweeting?
- Mostly women.

722
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:43,043
- Mostly bad stuff?
- And Pepper Burke sent out another tweet.

723
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:45,412
During the show?
I wish they'd wait until after.

724
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,314
- Or at least a commercial.
- What's going on here?

725
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:49,116
- She tweeted again.
- Yeah.

726
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,585
And Miles Deaken pulled
my pigtails in kindergarten.

727
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:55,154
- Could I...
- What was the second tweet?

728
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,690
"Another battle lost
in the war on women."

729
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:00,326
And also on that metaphor.
Did you call his phone?

730
00:33:00,427 --> 00:33:02,195
- Yeah, there was no answer.
- You left a message?

731
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,130
- I called the hospital.
- You left a message for him?

732
00:33:04,231 --> 00:33:05,498
- Yeah.
- Good.

733
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,166
It's gonna mean a lot to him.

734
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:10,568
- You didn't, did you?
- No.

735
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:12,204
- Come on, do it, now.
- It's not that simple.

736
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:13,705
- Yes, it is.
- After the show.

737
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:15,673
I'm saying in addition
you should call now,

738
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:18,576
his phone, and leave a message.
Start to turn this around.

739
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:20,612
I think I'm making a mistake

740
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:22,447
not having Neal write
something to this woman.

741
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:24,081
"It was a pleasure
meeting you at lunch.

742
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:25,482
I'm sorry you felt snubbed."

743
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:26,717
Yeah, but maybe
it should be longer.

744
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:28,219
What else do you want to say?

745
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,987
- I had to hurry back to the office.
- What else?

746
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:32,523
I don't think any woman
with a coffee cup is a waitress.

747
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,491
<i>I don't think women
are only suited to be waitresses.</i>

748
00:33:34,592 --> 00:33:36,593
Are you sure you want to be
that insulting to waitresses?

749
00:33:36,694 --> 00:33:38,095
- You're right.
- Will.

750
00:33:38,196 --> 00:33:40,663
- Yeah?
- Forget about the fucking tweet!

751
00:33:40,764 --> 00:33:43,699
Look, I get that it's stupid,
but it has an effect.

752
00:33:43,801 --> 00:33:45,501
And we haven't been getting
the bounces lately.

753
00:33:45,602 --> 00:33:47,603
And there's injustice.

754
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:50,773
Living with that much injustice

755
00:33:50,874 --> 00:33:53,243
from the person
who was supposed to represent--

756
00:33:53,344 --> 00:33:55,745
He's the one who tells you
what the world is going to think of you.

757
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:57,947
And if he tells you you're bad--
That forever.

758
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:00,983
Not forever.
That's my point.

759
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:04,753
<i>- 30 seconds.</i>
- 30 seconds.

760
00:34:07,657 --> 00:34:09,624
If you're thinking on the off chance
he might die tonight,

761
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:11,427
you can win the last frame
by sticking it to him--

762
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:12,961
- I'm not.
- Then why are you talking about justice?

763
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:14,996
- I don't know what to say.
- It's voice mail.

764
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:16,897
"Dad, it's Will.
I just heard--"

765
00:34:16,999 --> 00:34:19,267
I'll call him
in the next break.

766
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:23,438
What was the third tweet?

767
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,006
The first was you blew her off

768
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,075
and she's a waitress
and you didn't respond to that.

769
00:34:27,176 --> 00:34:29,909
And the second was the lost battle
and you didn't respond to that.

770
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:32,745
What was the third?

771
00:34:32,847 --> 00:34:34,614
"You just lost a viewer."

772
00:34:37,818 --> 00:34:39,319
She knows what she's doing.

773
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:48,260
Two large explosions,
believed to be car bombs,

774
00:34:48,362 --> 00:34:50,463
have rocked the Syrian
capital of Damascus,

775
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:52,031
destroying two
government buildings,

776
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:54,833
killing at least 27
and injuring at least 97,

777
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:58,504
with authorities saying
those numbers are likely to go up.

778
00:34:58,605 --> 00:35:00,238
The window's gonna be
pretty small

779
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:02,107
after we wait another
4:07 to listen to it.

780
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,209
<i>We're gonna have to bump
something late in the show.</i>

781
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,177
Yeah.

782
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,513
How long have you been
waiting to say something?

783
00:35:10,116 --> 00:35:12,050
I don't know.

784
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:14,886
You have questions
about my--

785
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,520
About drinking and men?

786
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:18,222
- You want to warn me about something?
- No.

787
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:20,957
'Cause I'm single.
Is my performance at work suffering?

788
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,626
No.

789
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:25,795
You know what it's like
in my place with Lisa?

790
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:29,199
I have to come home after she comes home,
and that ain't easy.

791
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,601
You'd think I'd be
out of the penalty box.

792
00:35:31,702 --> 00:35:33,802
Just get someplace
else to live.

793
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:35,438
No sweat.

794
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,540
It's been six months.

795
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:41,877
You're unpredictable and moody.

796
00:35:41,978 --> 00:35:44,013
You're unpleasant and volatile
and begging for a fight.

797
00:35:44,114 --> 00:35:46,282
- All that's on my Match.com profile.
- Maggie.

798
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:50,685
Does anyone have a problem
with my performance at work?

799
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:52,320
No.

800
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:57,692
It's uploading to the network drive.

801
00:35:57,793 --> 00:35:59,761
You work on it in the edit bay,
20 to 25 seconds.

802
00:35:59,862 --> 00:36:02,364
I'll write the copy and build the segment.
We need it fast.

803
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:04,765
<i>Jerry Dantana
was chasing a rumor here.</i>

804
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:06,300
That's what
he's supposed to do.

805
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:08,569
I thought his profile
was low enough

806
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,438
that he wouldn't
set off any buzzers.

807
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:11,939
<i>What's the rumor?</i>

808
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,507
I can't tell you that.

809
00:36:13,608 --> 00:36:14,841
Don't you want me
to wave you off?

810
00:36:14,943 --> 00:36:17,044
I doubt you'd know about this.

811
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:19,880
- Really?
- I can't tell you what it is.

812
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:22,382
You're irritating people whose help
you're gonna need on other things.

813
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:24,784
I don't know what to say.
He wasn't doing anything out of line.

814
00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:26,186
And you'd follow up on this,
too.

815
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:27,487
Something to do
with chemical weapons?

816
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:29,622
- I can't tell you.
- But it is, right?

817
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:31,591
- Shep.
- It's a fucking serious allegation, Charlie.

818
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:32,758
Nobody's making the allegation.

819
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,827
That's a war crime.

820
00:36:34,928 --> 00:36:37,062
I mean, can you imagine?

821
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:39,331
People would go away
for a long time.

822
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:41,100
There'd be riots
in the Middle East.

823
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:42,801
There'd be riots here at home.

824
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:44,570
Our allies would be in a fix

825
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,138
and America would
lose any claim

826
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:48,740
to moral authority
around the world.

827
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,809
If that's the story
you're chasing.

828
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,879
I can't tell you
what the story is.

829
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,850
Let me ask you this.

830
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,587
If your son were a Marine
like you were

831
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:06,023
and he was taken and we knew
he was a couple hours away

832
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:09,058
from being sold for the purpose of
a public beheading,

833
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,027
<i>would you have a problem
with a MARSOC unit</i>

834
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,997
<i>conducting an extraction
using any means necessary?</i>

835
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:21,037
Your hypothetical
bears a remarkable resemblance

836
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,805
to the rumor
we've been chasing.

837
00:37:24,674 --> 00:37:26,242
Does it?

838
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:28,910
Dr. Worth,
does a US President

839
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:32,080
- have any control over gas prices?
- Yes, Will.

840
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:36,519
<i>These assholes,
they always get away.</i>

841
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,720
<i>When you come
to the clubhouse...</i>

842
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:40,022
Back it up
to "these assholes."

843
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:41,623
- Just keep him talking.
- Yeah.

844
00:37:41,723 --> 00:37:43,057
Ask him where he's from,
what does he do,

845
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,092
- why is his wife in New York?
- Mr. Kouri...

846
00:37:45,194 --> 00:37:48,095
<i>You say it's on the
left-hand side from the clubhouse?</i>

847
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:51,633
<i>No, you go in
straight through the entrance</i>

848
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:55,637
<i>and then you make a left--
You go straight in.</i>

849
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:57,704
<i>Don't turn and make a left.
Shit, he's running.</i>

850
00:37:57,805 --> 00:38:00,073
We have more oil and gas
in the shale

851
00:38:00,175 --> 00:38:02,809
of North Dakota and California
and a few other states

852
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,311
<i>than in all of Saudi Arabia.</i>

853
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:06,012
But the price is set globally.

854
00:38:06,113 --> 00:38:09,616
If Australia is willing
to pay Chevron $100 a barrel

855
00:38:09,717 --> 00:38:11,785
and we aren't,
Chevron's gonna sell it to Australia.

856
00:38:11,886 --> 00:38:14,320
<i>- He's running?
- Which way is he running?</i>

857
00:38:14,421 --> 00:38:15,788
- <i>Down towards...</i>
<i>- Do we need that?</i>

858
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:17,756
We've got less
than five minutes.

859
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:19,825
"This week, as national
attention has increased,

860
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:22,127
the Sanford Police Department's
handling of the investigation

861
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:24,029
has come under
intense pressure to release..."

862
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,764
Newt Gingrich
is smart enough to know

863
00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:27,933
that one of the reasons
Jimmy Carter lost reelection

864
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:31,236
<i>was because his high inflation
caused high gas prices.</i>

865
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:33,371
But we have
no inflation right now.

866
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,607
Just keep breathing.
Help is almost there.

867
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:37,642
<i>- All right.
- And what is your name?</i>

868
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:39,711
<i>George. He ran.</i>

869
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:42,514
<i>- All right, George.
- What's your last name?</i>

870
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:44,781
- <i>Zimmerman.</i>
<i>- That's it. Send it.</i>

871
00:38:44,882 --> 00:38:46,550
I'm happy to say
the Gingrich plan

872
00:38:46,651 --> 00:38:48,752
moves you towards
2.50 or less.

873
00:38:48,853 --> 00:38:52,523
<i>The Obama plan moves you
towards $9 or $10 or more.</i>

874
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:55,826
If he can set the price,
then why isn't it a buck 75?

875
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:57,328
<i>How did he settle on 2.50?</i>

876
00:38:57,429 --> 00:38:58,495
And what else will be cheaper

877
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:00,130
if Newt Gingrich
is elected president?

878
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:01,631
<i>You know that's
not how it works.</i>

879
00:39:01,732 --> 00:39:04,200
<i>I absolutely know
that's not how it works.</i>

880
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:07,002
Thank you, Howard Worth
of the American Policy Group.

881
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:09,805
You're watching <i>News Night</i> on ACN.
We'll be back after this.

882
00:39:09,906 --> 00:39:12,141
- Three minutes back.
- We've got the 911 tape

883
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:14,510
- <i>and we'll open the next block with it.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

884
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:18,146
So your son's a Marine
like you were

885
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:20,949
and he's taken
and we know there's a plan.

886
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,984
We know he's a few hours away
from being sold

887
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:25,119
for the purpose
of public beheading.

888
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,954
You wouldn't do it?

889
00:39:29,057 --> 00:39:31,259
Do what, Shep?

890
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,228
They've got a huge crazy problem,
Charlie.

891
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:36,597
Black and white can live together.
Christian and Muslim.

892
00:39:36,698 --> 00:39:39,199
But you can't have most of the world
living in the 21st century

893
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:40,933
and the rest living
in the eighth century.

894
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:43,936
Unless they're willing to limit themselves
to eighth century weapons.

895
00:39:44,037 --> 00:39:46,273
They've got a big
fucking crazy problem

896
00:39:46,374 --> 00:39:48,441
which simply is not addressed
in Common Article I

897
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,744
of the Geneva Conventions.

898
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:53,546
What are you telling me?

899
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:56,548
These guys--
Special Forces,

900
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,417
MARSOC, SEALs--

901
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:00,952
they live under constant threat
of death and torture.

902
00:40:01,053 --> 00:40:03,889
<i>Should they come home and be
threatened with prison?</i>

903
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,858
Isn't it time to change
the public perception?

904
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:08,627
If your son were the one in there,
wouldn't you do it?

905
00:40:08,728 --> 00:40:10,228
Wouldn't you insist it be done?

906
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:14,465
Do what?

907
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:16,701
I'm sorry and all,
but you have to fix the crazy problem.

908
00:40:16,802 --> 00:40:19,470
'Cause this is what happens
when you make it ours.

909
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:24,575
Anyway, I'm gonna go
catch the last shuttle.

910
00:40:25,644 --> 00:40:27,512
Here's some information on

911
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:29,479
why we need
yottabytes of memory.

912
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,615
That's why I was here.

913
00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:33,383
Sorry it's crumpled.

914
00:40:48,332 --> 00:40:51,166
Is this the right time to ask
why you date men like this?

915
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:52,668
- No.
- It's not?

916
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:54,903
- It's not the right time.
- All right.

917
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:57,373
Because you don't know
they're like that until they are.

918
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:59,508
But they are a lot
with you and--

919
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:01,142
There's no way to tell, Don.

920
00:41:01,243 --> 00:41:03,911
- I'm sorry. I don't believe that.
- You don't?

921
00:41:04,012 --> 00:41:06,514
I don't believe that someone
who is capable of this,

922
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:08,950
that a shithead this big
is able to keep it a secret

923
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:11,820
from someone they've been
dating for seven weeks.

924
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,122
You're saying I knew
he was like this but didn't care?

925
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:18,225
I'm saying you don't have a very high opinion
of yourself and I don't get it.

926
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:20,227
And since it's not
the right time,

927
00:41:20,328 --> 00:41:22,062
let me also say if it had been
a woman who had done this,

928
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:24,030
her friends would be saying,
"You go, girl!"

929
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:27,300
I promise you, he's getting that right now
from his friends in arbitrage.

930
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,336
No.

931
00:41:29,437 --> 00:41:31,739
That's the difference.
Deep down, they think he's an asshole.

932
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,239
He's an asshole right on top.

933
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,241
No, they,
his friends in arbitrage--

934
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:37,510
I know. I was making a joke.

935
00:41:37,644 --> 00:41:39,579
You're really--

936
00:41:44,399 --> 00:41:46,195
You're impressive.

937
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:51,155
I have to make a phone call.

938
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:01,120
- Did you call?
- I did. I called.

939
00:42:01,133 --> 00:42:03,034
- Did you really?
- I did.

940
00:42:04,946 --> 00:42:06,930
That was the right thing.

941
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:10,253
You know it was the right thing,
and you get to live with that now.

942
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:12,476
And you're going to
make your father very happy

943
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:14,077
when he gets the message.

944
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:15,679
I know.

945
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:26,039
So call me back at the office.
I'll be here until 11:30.

946
00:42:26,063 --> 00:42:28,324
Or you can call me
on my cell any time.

947
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:33,496
I saw a guy named
Philip Adams last night.

948
00:42:33,597 --> 00:42:35,865
Phil Adams.
He's well-connected in the acute caucus

949
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:39,252
of the mental patient wing in the
exotic disorders extreme of the GOP.

950
00:42:39,275 --> 00:42:41,904
We were talking about Simon Weingarden,
and I asked Adams

951
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:44,807
if he'd have any trouble getting confirmed
as solicitor general if the job opened.

952
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:46,708
Like has he been paid to speak

953
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,077
to the Righteous Daughters
of Jihadi Excellence or anything?

954
00:42:49,178 --> 00:42:50,851
- <i>And due to my dry delivery--</i>
- Are you kidding me?

955
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,425
No, when I'm in the right mood
I'm like Jack Benny.

956
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:54,198
No, I'm talking about--
Somebody ran it?

957
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:57,384
WorldNetDaily. I've been calling Adams.
That was the third time.

958
00:42:57,486 --> 00:42:59,654
You've gotta call someone there.
You've gotta call an editor.

959
00:42:59,755 --> 00:43:01,355
- Why haven't you done that?
- Why haven't I--

960
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:03,491
- Called an editor.
- I wasn't sure does WorldNetDaily even have--

961
00:43:03,592 --> 00:43:05,526
Yes! Their names and numbers
are in the database.

962
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:07,962
<i>This is gonna get out of control
and Weingarden's getting tagged.</i>

963
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:10,997
I can't be blamed for-- I don't think--
How much do you think I can be blamed?

964
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:12,966
All right,
here's a senior editor.

965
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:18,338
I'm calling a guy named Munch.

966
00:43:18,439 --> 00:43:20,373
I'm not gonna make it out
of this call alive.

967
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:23,142
- Put it on speaker.
- You can't laugh.

968
00:43:23,243 --> 00:43:26,579
How am I going to stop myself
when all I've been doing is laughing for hours?

969
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:39,124
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mr. Munch?

970
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:42,026
The case took a turn today
when the part-time Mayor of Sanford,

971
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:44,696
Jeff Triplett,
overruled his police department

972
00:43:44,797 --> 00:43:46,998
and released the 911 tape
to the press.

973
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,934
We received the audio recording
just a few minutes ago,

974
00:43:50,035 --> 00:43:52,036
and we'll play a portion now.

975
00:43:52,137 --> 00:43:55,139
<i>This guy looks like
he's up to no good</i>

976
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,874
<i>or he's on drugs or something.</i>

977
00:43:56,975 --> 00:44:00,410
<i>It's raining and he's just
walking around looking about.</i>

978
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,346
- <i>He looks black.</i>
<i>- Did you see what he was wearing?</i>

979
00:44:03,447 --> 00:44:06,216
- I was just being hyperbolic.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

980
00:44:06,317 --> 00:44:08,886
I didn't think there was any way
I could be taken seriously.

981
00:44:08,987 --> 00:44:10,387
<i>Yeah, I can see that,
but the thing is,</i>

982
00:44:10,488 --> 00:44:12,088
<i>we've got it
from multiple sources.</i>

983
00:44:12,189 --> 00:44:15,257
David, come on.
You got to take it down and run a retraction.

984
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:16,759
<i>I appreciate you
clarifying your role,</i>

985
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,594
<i>but like I said,
you weren't the only one.</i>

986
00:44:18,695 --> 00:44:20,496
I was the only source.
Come on now.

987
00:44:20,597 --> 00:44:22,832
<i>I don't think I appreciate being
woken up and called a liar.</i>

988
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:24,333
It's 8:45.
Where do you live?

989
00:44:24,434 --> 00:44:26,335
<i>Let's say good night, Don.</i>

990
00:44:26,436 --> 00:44:29,838
- My friend, I get that this story is pushing traffic...
<i>- That has nothing--</i>

991
00:44:29,939 --> 00:44:32,373
...but Weingarden didn't do anything
except become a lawyer.

992
00:44:32,474 --> 00:44:34,308
- So...
<i>- I'll tell you for the third time--</i>

993
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,011
<i>We have multiple sources
telling us--</i>

994
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:39,548
That he spoke to the Righteous Daughters
of Jihadi Excellence?

995
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:43,284
<i>It turns out your joke
was right on the money.</i>

996
00:44:47,022 --> 00:44:50,190
I made up the fucking name,
David!

997
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:53,627
There is no such thing as the
Righteous Daughters of the--

998
00:44:53,728 --> 00:44:55,462
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

999
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:57,698
- Did you search it?
<i>- I just did.</i>

1000
00:44:57,799 --> 00:44:59,332
<i>There are 17 entries.</i>

1001
00:44:59,434 --> 00:45:02,268
That's because of your story,
fat-ass!

1002
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,804
<i>Mr. Keefer, I think
you're extremely--</i>

1003
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:11,077
Have Neal write this story
including this phone call

1004
00:45:11,178 --> 00:45:12,879
and post it on
our website tonight.

1005
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,414
Cut off the air supply
to the morning shows.

1006
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:18,416
I think I'm done in here.

1007
00:45:21,688 --> 00:45:23,188
Thanks, pal.

1008
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:32,064
<i>Here to speak with us
tonight is Nia Robbie,</i>

1009
00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:33,998
<i>a lawyer for the NAACP.</i>

1010
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:36,500
<i>This is the first time either of us
have heard that recording.</i>

1011
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:38,135
<i>What are your initial thoughts?</i>

1012
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,437
<i>I think it's pretty clear
this was racially motivated.</i>

1013
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:41,906
<i>I don't think anything's clear.</i>

1014
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:43,273
He's black.
He's up to no good.

1015
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:44,809
He's looking at all the houses.

1016
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,811
His family says he may have
been listening to music

1017
00:45:46,912 --> 00:45:49,479
on his iPhone and not even aware
Zimmerman was watching.

1018
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,348
His family would have no way
of knowing that, though, right?

1019
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,183
What they know,
what we know is that he was armed

1020
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,686
- <i>with a bag of Skittles and some very dangerous iced tea.</i>
- Mac.

1021
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,788
It's George Zimmerman
who gets the benefit of the doubt now.

1022
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,890
A benefit never
afforded to Trayvon.

1023
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,926
Nia,
Mr. Zimmerman claimed

1024
00:46:03,027 --> 00:46:05,161
that Trayvon Martin
looked suspicious.

1025
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,263
- <i>That's right.</i>
<i>- How does one look suspicious?</i>

1026
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:08,631
<i>You'd have to ask
Mr. Zimmerman.</i>

1027
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,799
This is a helo manifest.

1028
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,735
From what?

1029
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,805
Operation Genoa.

1030
00:46:16,906 --> 00:46:20,376
This is the first piece of paper
we've seen with that name.

1031
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,477
Listen,

1032
00:46:22,578 --> 00:46:25,847
I sang in an a cappella group in college,
the Whiskey Sodas.

1033
00:46:25,948 --> 00:46:27,282
When we'd tour,

1034
00:46:27,383 --> 00:46:30,084
the secretary would have
to submit an expense report.

1035
00:46:30,186 --> 00:46:32,387
We'd want to bring
a ton of weed,

1036
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:34,523
but we wanted the group
to pay for it.

1037
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:38,392
So in the expense report,
instead of saying weed,

1038
00:46:38,493 --> 00:46:40,361
it would say chickens.

1039
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:41,962
Look at the manifest.

1040
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:46,967
".50 cal ammunition.

1041
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:50,837
M261 FFAR
2.75 rocket pods.

1042
00:46:50,938 --> 00:46:52,839
MX-76."

1043
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,674
What's MX-76?

1044
00:46:54,775 --> 00:46:56,075
There's no such thing.

1045
00:46:56,177 --> 00:46:57,577
I called three quartermasters.

1046
00:46:57,678 --> 00:46:59,312
- It was the gas.
- Look--

1047
00:46:59,413 --> 00:47:02,549
We dropped sarin.
This is a true story.

1048
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:06,519
It happened
and we're gonna prove it.

1049
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,254
Where'd you get this?

1050
00:47:14,427 --> 00:47:15,994
Can I talk to you a second?

1051
00:47:16,095 --> 00:47:18,397
- Yeah. Is there a problem?
- Yeah.

1052
00:47:20,733 --> 00:47:22,867
I'm transcribing
the full text of the 911 call.

1053
00:47:22,968 --> 00:47:25,670
The 911 operator asks is he white,
black, or Hispanic

1054
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,538
and Zimmerman answers,
"He looks black."

1055
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,307
Yeah.

1056
00:47:29,408 --> 00:47:31,175
You cut
the operator's question.

1057
00:47:33,512 --> 00:47:35,379
Yeah, but...

1058
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:45,655
Excuse me, I...

1059
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:58,667
Jesse.

1060
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:00,536
I'm sorry, I've got
to bump the segment.

1061
00:48:00,637 --> 00:48:02,271
- Why?
- We screwed up.

1062
00:48:02,372 --> 00:48:04,506
We aired a badly edited tape
of George Zimmerman

1063
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:06,908
talking to the 911 operator
and I need the space

1064
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,677
so we can air the full tape
at the end of the show.

1065
00:48:08,778 --> 00:48:10,212
Is this because
I said I was coming out?

1066
00:48:10,313 --> 00:48:12,615
- No.
- Because I was gonna come out on the air?

1067
00:48:12,716 --> 00:48:14,816
No. I just told you
the reason.

1068
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:16,852
I don't believe you.

1069
00:48:16,953 --> 00:48:18,720
I guess I'm gonna have
to live with that.

1070
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:20,355
People are gonna know
about this.

1071
00:48:20,456 --> 00:48:23,524
140-character public shaming
is absolutely in order,

1072
00:48:23,626 --> 00:48:25,493
but make sure you blame it
on Will and not me

1073
00:48:25,594 --> 00:48:27,929
'cause Will's the famous one
and you'll want traction.

1074
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,231
Why are you acting
like such a bitch?

1075
00:48:36,171 --> 00:48:37,838
I was gonna lose
the segment anyway

1076
00:48:37,939 --> 00:48:39,640
and it was 'cause you
were gonna come out.

1077
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:41,575
If it makes you uncomfortable,
then maybe you should come to our meetings.

1078
00:48:41,676 --> 00:48:43,110
You want to come out on TV,
I don't care.

1079
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:46,079
But you can't do it here.
He's not Maury Povich.

1080
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,015
Tyler was robbed of his right to come out
to the world on his own terms.

1081
00:48:49,116 --> 00:48:50,784
Dharun made
that decision for him.

1082
00:48:50,885 --> 00:48:53,186
I'm doing what Tyler
never had the chance to do.

1083
00:48:53,287 --> 00:48:55,088
I'm taking the power back.

1084
00:48:56,356 --> 00:48:58,658
Jesse, you're full of shit.

1085
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:01,127
You want to be a D-lister
and that's it.

1086
00:49:01,228 --> 00:49:03,862
You want to get onstage
and you want to call him Tyler

1087
00:49:03,963 --> 00:49:05,730
even though you told me
you didn't know him

1088
00:49:05,832 --> 00:49:07,966
so you can bathe
in his reflected tragedy.

1089
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:10,102
Fuck you, Jesse.

1090
00:49:10,203 --> 00:49:12,805
That kid killed himself
because his privacy was stolen.

1091
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:16,074
And you think you're
honoring him by tweeting

1092
00:49:16,176 --> 00:49:19,643
about coming out
in front of a million and a half strangers?

1093
00:49:22,214 --> 00:49:25,748
I'll put up color bars
before I'll put you in front of our cameras.

1094
00:49:28,686 --> 00:49:32,088
I thought it was one way
to tell my parents the news

1095
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,756
and not be there when I did.

1096
00:49:37,028 --> 00:49:38,394
Well, good luck with that.

1097
00:49:38,495 --> 00:49:40,663
Thanks.

1098
00:49:40,764 --> 00:49:43,665
I saw a video online.
It gets better.

1099
00:49:43,766 --> 00:49:45,767
How would you know?

1100
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:47,970
I guess I wouldn't.

1101
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,571
Take it easy.

1102
00:49:54,878 --> 00:49:56,778
I've known a few of these guys.

1103
00:49:56,879 --> 00:49:59,380
I know this one very well.

1104
00:50:01,217 --> 00:50:04,052
Having a relationship
with an audience is cool.

1105
00:50:04,153 --> 00:50:06,754
I get it.
As long as it doesn't turn serious.

1106
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:09,157
As long as it's hooking up
and home before sunrise,

1107
00:50:09,258 --> 00:50:12,260
then everything's
fine 'cause...

1108
00:50:12,361 --> 00:50:14,661
They don't feel about you

1109
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,463
the way you want them to.

1110
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:21,468
You were gonna get killed.
I did you a favor.

1111
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:26,840
<i>Sanford is a high crime area,</i>

1112
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,541
<i>and this community
in particular.</i>

1113
00:50:28,642 --> 00:50:30,776
Is it possible that the extra motivation,
as you said,

1114
00:50:30,878 --> 00:50:32,578
pursuing Trayvon
Martin on foot...

1115
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:35,748
<i>When the dispatcher
told him plainly not to.</i>

1116
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:38,251
We're all set. We wanted to wait
for a commercial break.

1117
00:50:38,352 --> 00:50:40,486
- That's them?
- Alim and Samirah Kouri.

1118
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:45,323
- Mr. Kouri?
<i>- Yes, this is me. I'm here.</i>

1119
00:50:45,424 --> 00:50:47,058
And Mrs. Kouri,
are you there?

1120
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:48,894
<i>I'm here.
Is help coming for my husband?</i>

1121
00:50:48,995 --> 00:50:50,695
<i>Will you put this call
on television?</i>

1122
00:50:50,796 --> 00:50:51,930
Here's the thing, guys.

1123
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,565
Syrians don't commonly say,
"Thank God."

1124
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:57,869
Nobody named Kouri
is registered at the W.

1125
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:01,071
And when that building came down,
it took the cell tower with it.

1126
00:51:03,909 --> 00:51:05,376
You still with me...

1127
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:07,411
Stewart?

1128
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:09,613
We have software
that unblocks phone numbers

1129
00:51:09,714 --> 00:51:11,916
and that's why your super
is knocking on your door

1130
00:51:12,017 --> 00:51:13,617
<i>right now with
a police officer.</i>

1131
00:51:13,718 --> 00:51:15,585
<i>Mr. Block, it's Ray.</i>

1132
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:17,453
<i>Could you open the door,
please?</i>

1133
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:19,355
Baba Booey, motherfuckers.

1134
00:51:21,658 --> 00:51:24,360
Tonight we take care
of all family business.

1135
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:26,095
Many people are also white.

1136
00:51:26,196 --> 00:51:28,331
Nia Robbie,
thank you for joining us.

1137
00:51:28,432 --> 00:51:30,766
- Thank you, Will.
- We'll be back after this.

1138
00:51:32,702 --> 00:51:35,404
- You're not making a rational expectations argument.
- I am.

1139
00:51:35,504 --> 00:51:38,340
Expectations, insofar as they're
informed by predictions,

1140
00:51:38,441 --> 00:51:40,242
are essentially--
Okay, look, if the prediction--

1141
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:42,177
All right, you're making a rational
expectations argument,

1142
00:51:42,278 --> 00:51:43,412
but you're not being rational.

1143
00:51:43,512 --> 00:51:45,880
There's no risk here.
What are we talking about?

1144
00:51:45,982 --> 00:51:48,683
It's not pure,
frictionless arbitrage.

1145
00:51:48,784 --> 00:51:50,952
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1146
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:53,287
Hey, Sloan.
You in the neighborhood?

1147
00:51:53,388 --> 00:51:55,423
Always.
I work a block over.

1148
00:51:55,523 --> 00:51:56,924
Cathy told me to come back.

1149
00:51:57,025 --> 00:51:59,126
Scott, can we talk
for just one second?

1150
00:51:59,227 --> 00:52:00,727
I'll have him right back.

1151
00:52:04,266 --> 00:52:06,099
Excuse me.

1152
00:52:16,277 --> 00:52:17,643
I made it to the rage phase.

1153
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,751
<i>Scott, where are you going?</i>

1154
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:28,553
Hey!

1155
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,992
No, no.

1156
00:52:36,096 --> 00:52:39,830
There have been nearly 200 hail reports
from Missouri to Alabama,

1157
00:52:39,931 --> 00:52:42,467
including baseball-sized hail
in Carrollton, Illinois.

1158
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:44,469
What happened?

1159
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:47,472
Jim, I swear to God
it was for time.

1160
00:52:47,572 --> 00:52:49,540
- You didn't hear it and think--
- I had to cut it to 25.

1161
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:51,775
You didn't hear it and think,
"If I take out the question

1162
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,543
- and only leave the answer"...
- I know.

1163
00:52:53,644 --> 00:52:55,745
- ..."it won't sound like it was an answer"?
- I didn't.

1164
00:52:55,846 --> 00:52:57,680
If I had, I would have--

1165
00:52:57,781 --> 00:52:59,049
Obviously I wouldn't
have cut it--

1166
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,119
- It was just for time?
- Yes.

1167
00:53:03,954 --> 00:53:06,623
You weren't trying
to see justice done?

1168
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:10,993
I had one pass.

1169
00:53:11,094 --> 00:53:13,062
I was hearing it
for the first time.

1170
00:53:13,163 --> 00:53:15,864
And I'm not sure I need to be disciplined
by a guy who gave away an interview,

1171
00:53:15,965 --> 00:53:17,866
'cause that happened, Jim,
that's what you did.

1172
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:20,469
You wanted to save Hallie,
so you gave away our interview.

1173
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,739
And watching you defend
that column when you know--

1174
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,482
I had six minutes
to cut a five-minute piece of audio

1175
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:36,551
down to 25 seconds.

1176
00:53:38,054 --> 00:53:39,554
I should have been
listening for it.

1177
00:53:39,655 --> 00:53:41,055
I know what 911 calls
sound like.

1178
00:53:41,156 --> 00:53:42,989
I just--

1179
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:45,492
I never remotely prepared
for this scenario.

1180
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,499
- Look--
- The thing is,

1181
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,134
I'm afraid to sleep
alone at night,

1182
00:53:54,235 --> 00:53:56,836
so sometimes I go out.

1183
00:53:56,938 --> 00:53:58,737
That's all.

1184
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:01,740
That's all it is.
That's all.

1185
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:07,813
Yeah.

1186
00:54:13,652 --> 00:54:16,821
All right, you apologize,
but make it brief.

1187
00:54:16,922 --> 00:54:18,557
- Yeah.
- A mea culpa isn't really right.

1188
00:54:18,657 --> 00:54:21,093
- I agree.
- The full audiotape is 4:07

1189
00:54:21,194 --> 00:54:22,527
and we're gonna play it
right through

1190
00:54:22,628 --> 00:54:25,197
and you should point out
the specific mistake that was made.

1191
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:27,765
- You want an intro on the prompter?
- No, I'm good.

1192
00:54:29,201 --> 00:54:30,601
After the show,
I'm gonna tell you about

1193
00:54:30,702 --> 00:54:32,936
the Bonnie and Clyde
of prank callers.

1194
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:35,072
Okay. How's Sloan?

1195
00:54:35,173 --> 00:54:37,475
She's gonna be fine.
She scratched herself for tonight,

1196
00:54:37,576 --> 00:54:39,176
but I just saw she's back
in Don's rundown.

1197
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,844
Good.

1198
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:44,215
According to a number
of Internet sources,

1199
00:54:44,316 --> 00:54:47,651
men your dad's age
have a full recovery rate of 93%.

1200
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:49,486
So especially
knowing your father--

1201
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:52,422
He died.
My father died.

1202
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:54,257
What did you say?

1203
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:56,259
He died.

1204
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,696
He had-- It's called
a ventricular fibrillation.

1205
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:02,932
When?

1206
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,835
About 10 minutes ago.

1207
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:08,070
12.
The last break.

1208
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:10,640
I called to leave a message
when I said I was gonna

1209
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,408
and my sister
answered his phone.

1210
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,345
- You've been sitting here--
- It's all right.

1211
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:19,313
- Will.
- It really is all right.

1212
00:55:20,582 --> 00:55:22,250
<i>Mac, we're up.</i>

1213
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:29,257
All right.
Here we go.

1214
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:43,737
<i>- In 10.
- Ready graphics 44 and 45.</i>

1215
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:45,839
Ready.

1216
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:51,110
<i>In five, four, three...</i>

1217
00:56:03,557 --> 00:56:05,691
Will.

1218
00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:08,860
Will, we're back on you.

1219
00:56:11,197 --> 00:56:13,165
- Go to commercial.
- We don't have one. This is the F block.

1220
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:16,168
- Is Terry ready in DC?
- Control, this is New York. Is Terry at the desk?

1221
00:56:16,268 --> 00:56:17,703
No.

1222
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:22,006
Will.

Well, I guess it's just us now.

1225
00:56:35,887 --> 00:56:39,555
We have an important correction
