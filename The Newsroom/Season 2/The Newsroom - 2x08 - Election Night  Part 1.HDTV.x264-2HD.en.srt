1
00:00:00,376 --> 00:00:02,020
This is <i>ACN Reports</i>,
and tonight

2
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:04,568
we tell you the story of
Operation Genoa.

3
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:08,066
<i>We asked if sarin gas was used.</i>

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,434
We used sarin.

5
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:11,602
- You here for a call?
- Congratulations?

6
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:13,970
General Stomtonovich.
Charlie, he's screaming.

7
00:00:14,003 --> 00:00:16,442
- What's he saying we did?
- Edited him out of context.

8
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,475
<i>He digitally remastered
an interview.</i>

9
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:20,177
That is the all of it.
That's it.

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:21,855
<i>The shot clock jumped</i>

11
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:24,914
from 19 to three to two to 14.

12
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:27,682
I think I shouldn't say anything more
until I've talked to a lawyer.

13
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:29,225
- You're fired.
- I know.

14
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:30,923
We have to retract
Genoa tonight.

15
00:00:30,956 --> 00:00:33,460
We'll call the election tomorrow
and then resign.

16
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:36,126
No, I do not accept
your resignations.

17
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:40,261
And Jerry Dantana's
not gonna get one fucking dollar.

18
00:00:40,294 --> 00:00:43,108
We don't have the trust
of the public anymore.

19
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:44,865
Get it back!

20
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:53,183

21
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:07,409
<i>I just need to know
we're off the record.</i>

22
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:09,446
<i>- That hurts me.</i>
- Hallie.

23
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,942
<i>You believe I would violate
our trust for a story?</i>

24
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:13,782
I believe you'd sell me
into slavery for a story.

25
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,408
- Well, that's just not true.
- Say we're off the record.

26
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:18,843
- <i>We're always off the record.</i>
- I need it for specifically right now.

27
00:02:18,876 --> 00:02:21,008
- You need me to say the words?
- Yes.

28
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,373
- You really need me to say the words?
- Yeah, and you haven't yet.

29
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:24,541
- <i>Well played.</i>
- Hallie.

30
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:25,773
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Say them.

31
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,983
We're off the record.

32
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:30,945
Last night at around
1:30 in the morning,

33
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:33,445
Charlie, Will,
and Mac all resigned.

34
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:35,409
Don and Maggie and I
were resigning.

35
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:37,237
Sloan, Neal was resigning.

36
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,338
I knew you guys--
I could tell you guys

37
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,169
were gonna do that
all during the depo prep.

38
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:43,977
Wait, you said were.
Were resigning.

39
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,281
Leona wouldn't accept their resignations--
Charlie, Will, and Mac.

40
00:02:46,314 --> 00:02:48,282
- You're kidding.
<i>- No.</i>

41
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:50,911
- Why?
- She didn't think it was the honorable thing to do.

42
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:52,710
- No, seriously.
- Hallie, I'm telling you,

43
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,578
she won't accept their resignations
and she won't settle the suit.

44
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,144
She wants to do the honorable thing.
Those were her words.

45
00:02:58,185 --> 00:03:01,551
And to her, that means standing by us
and not caving to the pressure.

46
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:03,152
- This is unprecedented.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:05,182
You have to let me
quote you on this.

48
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:07,419
All these years,
what did you think "off the record" meant?

49
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:08,881
- I'm saying on background.
- No.

50
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,319
Shh!

51
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:15,919
No. There's no story
until Charlie says so.

52
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,559
She'll hold you
in material breach.

53
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:20,060
- Are you just saying that?
- No, she's very serious.

54
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:22,523
- If we resign anyway, she'll sue us?
- She'll win, too.

55
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:24,330
- We're trying to do the right thing.
- So is she.

56
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:26,626
There's a mob out there
with pitchforks.

57
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,594
- She doesn't like mobs.
<i>- What if the mob's right?</i>

58
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:29,865
- They're not.
<i>- Says who?</i>

59
00:03:29,898 --> 00:03:31,528
Me and her.

60
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:33,933
We aired a story.
A small story? No.

61
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,298
<i>A story asserting
that we used--</i>

62
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:37,930
- Sarin gas.
- On civilians.

63
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:40,267
We retracted the story
48 hours later

64
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,540
because we were
a little wrong? No.

65
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,571
- We aired--
- A complete fiction.

66
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:47,103
- You don't have to be mean about it.
- You aired a bad story.

67
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:49,869
- It was a great story.
- If only it had been true.

68
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,509
Well, I'm sorry we didn't meet
your East Coast intellectual standards.

69
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:55,478
- Hey, I'm not fucking around.
- She's not accepting your resignations.

70
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,779
- This place is crippled.
- I understand that--

71
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:00,409
To start with,
we don't have military sources anymore.

72
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,312
- The DOD doesn't talk to us.
- Do you think that's maybe

73
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,679
because you falsely accused them
of heinous war crimes?

74
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,285
I do.
I think that's the reason.

75
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:10,987
But that's small beer compared
to our public credibility.

76
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,187
- That, your credibility--
- Has disappeared?

77
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,491
- <i>Yes.</i>
- So one less thing we have to worry about.

78
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:17,187
Why are you jovial?

79
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,154
I've appointed myself
in charge of morale.

80
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:21,361
- <i>That's what it's come to.</i>
- He's right.

81
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:25,595
We aired a doctored tape
in support of a fake report.

82
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:28,637
The guy who doctored
the tape is suing us.

83
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,069
The woman who's always wanted
to fire us won't let us resign.

84
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,877
The unhappiest guy in the building
is in charge of morale.

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,181
- We have gone to the zoo!
- True story.

86
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:39,517
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Which is more than we can say about the story.

87
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:40,982
- That's right.
- But on the bright side--

88
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,119
There is no bright side,
Father Flanagan.

89
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:45,455
- Don't finish that sentence.
- I wasn't gonna be able to anyway.

90
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,489
Reese is having
a viewing party upstairs?

91
00:04:52,522 --> 00:04:54,689
Yeah.
Look at me.

92
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,331
Why am I looking at you?

93
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,869
Because I'm dressed
for the party.

94
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,533
- Got it.
- I look hot.

95
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,670
- I'm gonna go upstairs--
- Liquid sex.

96
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:03,110
I'm gonna go upstairs and--
What are you saying?

97
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:06,479
I just described myself
as liquid sex.

98
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:08,710
Add to the list
that this is our lawyer.

99
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,846
No kidding.
I'm gonna go upstairs at some point tonight.

100
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,415
- When?
- When there's a minute.

101
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,289
I'm gonna go upstairs
and work on Reese.

102
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:18,196
- You want me to help?
- I'd love you to.

103
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:21,829
But someone has to endure
the soul-swallowing humiliation

104
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,798
of having their name
and face broadcast

105
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:26,135
next to the ACN logo
for the next six hours.

106
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,871
I can't believe you guys didn't choose
him for the morale job.

107
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,408
I'm gonna need to talk
to Don Keefer.

108
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:32,744
He's pretty busy right now.

109
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:34,218
- Later, then.
- Why?

110
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,085
He has attorney/client
privilege,

111
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:38,223
but he's not gonna be happy.

112
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:41,331
All right. Can I have a moment?

113
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:43,171
Sure.

114
00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:47,678
I think he meant with me.

115
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:51,509
That wasn't made clear.

116
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:55,719
MacKenzie's taking this
the hardest.

117
00:05:55,784 --> 00:05:57,488
She wanted it to be over.

118
00:05:57,521 --> 00:06:00,793
She thought she was
gonna be humanely put down.

119
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:03,698
Yeah, she's, you know,
she's shaken up.

120
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,930
You can fire her.

121
00:06:05,963 --> 00:06:09,434
You don't need Leona's permission
and I can't do it without yours.

122
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,907
- And she can't quit.
- I know. I'm not firing anybody.

123
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,804
I'm not firing anybody either.

124
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,381
I just badly need
to get fired myself.

125
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:18,445
So you'd agree
this is an unusual situation?

126
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,381
These things--

127
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,517
Why don't you just set yourself on fire
instead of the cigarette?

128
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,389
One's enjoyable to me
and the other would cause a lot of pain.

129
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,592
- It's not even a choice.
- Have a good show.

130
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:31,361
Good show.

131
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:37,708
- Want this back?
- No.

132
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,682
There's a race for state rep in Hutchinson,
Kansas, that defies cliché.

133
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,389
The Democratic incumbent,
Jan Pauls, is anti-gay.

134
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:52,728
- Gay marriage?
<i>- Gay person anti-gay.</i>

135
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:55,231
The Democrat is the state's
leading LGBT opponent.

136
00:06:55,264 --> 00:06:58,000
She narrowly defeated
her primary challenger Erich Bishop,

137
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:00,232
<i>the openly gay son
of a former Klan member.</i>

138
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:03,674
Tonight, Jan Pauls faces off against her
Republican challenger,

139
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:07,076
who's a pro-choice, pro-gay rights railroad
conductor named Dakota Bass.

140
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:10,013
There's no way I'm not spending
the entire night talking about this race.

141
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:11,852
I am.

142
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:13,915
- I called it.
- What do you mean you called it?

143
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:15,715
- I just told you about it.
- Did you call it?

144
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:18,050
- I--
- No. Right?

145
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:19,986
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything,

146
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:22,593
but I've always understood
that you had to call it.

147
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:27,226
I did call--

148
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:31,466
Okay, it's obviously
every man for himself out there.

149
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,866
Hey. It's time
to get you guys wired.

150
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:35,403
Taylor, I know
it's your first time,

151
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:37,476
so don't worry that you're going
to be bad at this.

152
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:38,780
Not worried, not my first time.

153
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:40,180
If it turns out
that you're bad on TV,

154
00:07:40,213 --> 00:07:41,812
- everyone else can cover for you.
- Cool.

155
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:44,088
I mean, you'll still have
to sit there for six hours,

156
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:45,888
- but you'll do it silently.
- Copy.

157
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:48,824
We open with polls closing in Kentucky,
South Carolina,

158
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:51,357
Vermont, Virginia,
Georgia, and Indiana.

159
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,059
And we can call Indiana
and Kentucky for Romney.

160
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:55,628
- Yeah, baby.
- You are to show no partisan emotion.

161
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:58,567
And another thing,
I'm not an embed on your bus.

162
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm the senior producer
of ACN's Election Night coverage.

163
00:08:00,841 --> 00:08:04,006
I brief the very important panelists,
which is why I brought Maggie to brief you.

164
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,638
Have a good show, everyone.

165
00:08:06,671 --> 00:08:09,374
Is there an ancient grudge
between your two families?

166
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:12,279
I called MacKenzie
and told her that Jim gave away

167
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:14,614
a one-on-one with the candidate
to another reporter on the bus.

168
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:18,850
And we just generally have
a special relationship.

169
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:21,314
- Hallie.
<i>- I'm sorry?</i>

170
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:24,323
Yes, he gave it to Hallie.

171
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:27,523
She's his girlfriend now,
so he's just mad that I ratted him out.

172
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:29,458
- But I had to.
- I'm Maggie Jordan.

173
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,825
- Hi.
- I hate Jim, too.

174
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:33,266
- No, you don't.
<i>- Yes, I do.</i>

175
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:35,929
- I don't hate Jim.
- I do.

176
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,033
Would it bother Jim
if you knew something before he did?

177
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:44,938
- It would a lot, yeah.
- Then we can both win.

178
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:46,913
Talk to me.

179
00:08:46,946 --> 00:08:48,345
Talk to me, too, sister.

180
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:51,787
Be less desperate
for female friends.

181
00:08:52,788 --> 00:08:54,818
I'm gonna own you out there.

182
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,527
- Have a good show tonight.
- You, too.

183
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:07,235
This is gonna be the night
when social media

184
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:09,802
- takes the mantle of democracy from--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

185
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,937
Hey, did you know
your book sold for $1,000?

186
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:13,905
- What do you mean?
- At the auction.

187
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:16,408
- My book?
- It got bid up to $1,000.

188
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,176
And you were afraid
no one was gonna buy it.

189
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,912
Go back for a second.

190
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:21,881
On Sunday, the auction
Reese had for Sandy relief.

191
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:24,080
- I was supposed to sign a book.
- You did sign a book.

192
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:25,912
Reese asked all the talent
to contribute something.

193
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:27,922
Will donated a round
of golf with Will.

194
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:29,252
Elliot's letting
someone read the news.

195
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:31,261
And Reese wanted you
to donate dinner and a movie,

196
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:33,123
but you said you'd sign a book.

197
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,562
Because I thought
nobody bidding on a book

198
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:36,657
would be less embarrassing
than nobody bidding on a date.

199
00:09:36,698 --> 00:09:39,697
Do you honestly--
Can I ask, do you seriously think--

200
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:41,564
I'm not suggesting you
should have donated a date--

201
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:44,907
But do you really think that if you had,
no one would have bid on it?

202
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,738
What I'm saying is that would have
been embarrassing.

203
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:50,810
So why not just donate the money
directly to Sandy, which is what I did.

204
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:52,843
Well, your book
went for $1,000.

205
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:55,978
Someone spent $1,000 on
<i>Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic:</i>

206
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,618
<i>The Economics of
Post-World War I Germany</i>?

207
00:09:57,651 --> 00:09:58,849
Hey, I'm as surprised
as anyone,

208
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,614
but I think what they were
buying was your autograph.

209
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:02,550
- I didn't sign it.
- You did.

210
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,256
- I didn't.
- I saw the inscription.

211
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:06,487
<i>"Ich hoffe,
sie zerreien dieses buch."</i>

212
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:08,590
"I hope you shred this book"?

213
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:11,387
- Is that what that means?
- Yes. I mean, I think. Yes.

214
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,967
Then it says, "Thank you
for your generosity, Sloan Sabbith."

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,734
- Are you sure?
- That was in English.

216
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,566
I didn't sign the book.
I was supposed to leave it

217
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:20,868
on my desk before
I left for the weekend and I didn't.

218
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:23,467
Somebody signed a copy for you
and sent it to the auction.

219
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,999
And somebody paid
$1,000 for it.

220
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:28,036
I feel terrible.
I feel really bad about this.

221
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,332
Please don't enlist me--

222
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:34,373
I need you to help me find
the person who bought it.

223
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:37,138
435 House races tonight,

224
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:40,105
33 Senate races,
538 electoral votes--

225
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:42,115
Yeah, but this is important.

226
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:43,715
Got it.

227
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,617
Are you busy?

228
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:55,320
- What do you need?
- Well, I have a story, but I need--

229
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:57,327
- Did you see the newest exit poll dump?
- I didn't.

230
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,062
3% of voters didn't decide until today
who they were voting for.

231
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:02,398
- How do they break?
- 52-43 Obama.

232
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:05,966
So, listen, Brody in California
condemned Todd Akin, right?

233
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,998
This morning. Took a special kind of
courage to wait two months.

234
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:09,567
His pollster must have
told him he had to.

235
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,505
- He had a reason not to.
- What?

236
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:14,976
In 1990, Brody wrote
in an SFA publication,

237
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,480
"It's a sad fact,
but women cry rape

238
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:19,816
to avoid embarrassment,
to exact revenge,

239
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,618
or just to draw attention.

240
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:24,050
If we have rape exceptions
to abortion laws,

241
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:26,319
women could now cry rape
to terminate an innocent life.

242
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,920
- We should be able to look past the--"
- Wow.

243
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:30,825
"--look past the mendacity.

244
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,699
Children are conceived by love,
not by rape."

245
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:36,236
- He condemned Akin?
<i>- This is what I'm saying.</i>

246
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,170
- This morning on Election Night?
- I think you're right.

247
00:11:38,203 --> 00:11:40,567
I think he has a pollster
who looked at undecided women

248
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,732
18-35 and told him
he had to roll the dice.

249
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,331
How did you find this quote?

250
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,037
Taylor Warren pointed me to it.

251
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,038
She's a Republican.

252
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:49,478
Why are you whispering that?

253
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,110
I love her doing
the right thing.

254
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,478
It wasn't so much that

255
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,548
as wanting to give me
something Jim didn't have.

256
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,147
- Ah, so it's adorable.
- Yeah.

257
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,579
I called his office
for comment--

258
00:11:57,612 --> 00:11:59,651
There's not gonna be anyone in his office.
This is election day.

259
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:01,452
His campaign office, too,
but I didn't get very high up.

260
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:04,128
Didn't you used to take showers
with his chief of staff?

261
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:06,359
- John Webb?
- Yeah.

262
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,896
We played tennis.

263
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,528
And then took showers together?

264
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:12,302
It's-- the--

265
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:14,902
I'm gonna make the call,
but they're individual showers.

266
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,406
Cool.
For privacy.

267
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:18,976
When you cut your hair,
did you want to look like

268
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,978
Joey Heatherton
and something went terribly wrong?

269
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:22,978
- Yep.
- It's ringing.

270
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:29,215
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- John, it's Don Keefer.

271
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,784
<i>Tell me some good news.</i>

272
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:33,722
I don't have exits for you.

273
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:36,333
I need to ask you about something
the congressman wrote

274
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:39,795
in a Students for America
publication in 1990, okay?

275
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,706
- John?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

276
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:48,342
He wrote, "It's a sad fact,
but women cry rape."

277
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,012
- <i>Yeah, I know it, Don.</i>
- All right.

278
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:52,145
First, can you confirm
that it's him?

279
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:53,810
<i>Okay, Don, I'm gonna call you back,
all right?</i>

280
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,482
We're on the air
in a few minutes.

281
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:57,579
<i>Can I get you to hold it
till I talk to some people?</i>

282
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,252
Why would I do that?

283
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:01,924
<i>I think I can
trade you something.</i>

284
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:06,655
You know we're in no mood
to be fucked around with, right?

285
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:09,256
<i>I do know, and I'm not.</i>

286
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,063
You have until 8:30 Eastern
or we'll go on the air

287
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,558
with "The congressman's
office declined to comment."

288
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,998
<i>Got it.</i>

289
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:21,001
What do you think
he wants to trade?

290
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:22,409
I don't know.

291
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:25,745
Do you think there is any chance
we just got incredibly lucky?

292
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,912
Well, our luck has been
outstanding lately.

293
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:34,553
The first Republican governor
in North Carolina since '88.

294
00:13:34,586 --> 00:13:36,322
We have to throw it to someone.

295
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,522
We can slide five minutes to get--
what's his name-- Louden?

296
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:40,490
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Is it Louden?

297
00:13:40,523 --> 00:13:42,061
<i>First two congressional races--
Maine one for Chellie Pingree</i>

298
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:43,701
<i>and New York three
for Steve Israel.</i>

299
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:45,996
Decision's saying we'll be able to call
South Carolina four.

300
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:47,931
- For who?
- I'm sorry?

301
00:13:47,965 --> 00:13:50,301
- South Carolina for who?
- No, we can call South Carolina four.

302
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:52,805
- Call it for who?
- Costello, Abbott,

303
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,648
South Carolina fourth congressional district,
Trey Gowdy.

304
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:57,182
- Got it.
- Okay.

305
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:59,079
- Can you give us a minute?
- Have a good show, guys.

306
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:00,984
- You, too.
- Good luck.

307
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:07,731
- The lawyer said she'll hold you in breach?
- Yeah.

308
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,701
- Rebecca?
- Greenway from the general counsel's office.

309
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:13,098
Said she'd hold you and Charlie
in material breach?

310
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:14,665
And invoke
the noncompete clause.

311
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:16,306
<i>Why don't we drop it
for six hours?</i>

312
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,435
What's Charlie gonna do now?

313
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:19,742
Reese is having a viewing party
on the 44th floor.

314
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,911
- Charlie's gonna work on him.
- The suit's gonna be filed tomorrow morning.

315
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:23,751
- Mac.
- That's a public document.

316
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:25,887
- If we can't get this done tonight--
<i>- I understand.</i>

317
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,289
- If she'll agree to settle tonight--
- I'm with you.

318
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:30,491
The world doesn't have to see a list,
you know?

319
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:33,258
A full-on description
of every embarrassing thing

320
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,794
that's gone on here
in the last 14 months.

321
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:36,530
The complaint will cover
more than 14 months.

322
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:38,002
- But don't worry about it.
- Stop saying that.

323
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:39,834
<i>Six hours of literally
nothing but breaking news</i>

324
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,005
and you're the traffic cop at
the intersection of all of it.

325
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:44,175
<i>During light moments,
only three people</i>

326
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,476
will be speaking in your ear at once,
but usually it'll be 10.

327
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,714
And I obviously don't have to
say that we need to do well.

328
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:51,781
<i>That's why my suggestion is
since we can't deal with it right now,</i>

329
00:14:51,814 --> 00:14:54,256
not to worry about it
until we're off the air.

330
00:14:58,094 --> 00:14:59,460
- Would you do me a favor?
- Anything.

331
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:00,724
- I mean this.
- Me, too.

332
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:02,626
- I'm not fucking around.
- What's the favor?

333
00:15:02,659 --> 00:15:05,163
Say what you want to say to me.

334
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,162
- What?
- Yes.

335
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:10,128
Then I'll say that I'm alarmed

336
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:12,369
by how little sleep you've had and that
you're about to go do this.

337
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:13,602
That's not what
I'm talking about.

338
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,033
That's what I'm talking about.

339
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:17,641
You're the most attractive woman
I have ever seen in real life

340
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:19,904
<i>and I'm sticking by that
statement and everything,</i>

341
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:22,473
but right now you're not making it easy.
Can you do this?

342
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:24,011
- Of course I can do this.
- I'm not kidding.

343
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:25,655
No news producer
in America's had sleep.

344
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:27,586
- They've had some.
- Forget about that.

345
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:30,218
You look like you were grown in
an environment where it's dark and damp.

346
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:32,615
Lovely,
but I'm talking about Genoa.

347
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:36,017
Why? We're gonna be
spending plenty of time talking about it.

348
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,482
God knows if we ever
take a break,

349
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:40,557
the <i>New York Times</i> will
keep talking about it for us.

350
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,799
Come on, six hours
of live election coverage.

351
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:44,833
For you and me,
that's like an orgy at a spa

352
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,835
where there are college
football games on TV

353
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:49,504
and from the trees hang
Christian Louboutins.

354
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:52,377
- I feel like--
- All in your size, all different kinds.

355
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,117
Heels like lightsabers. Boots--
Boots are hanging from the trees.

356
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,686
You feel like I'm what?

357
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,717
A bomb that hasn't detonated.

358
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,554
- You do?
- And it's going to.

359
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,693
And I could live without the element of surprise,
so if we could...

360
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:09,892
- Suede. Lots of suede.
- ...<i>Hurt Locker</i> this thing, it'd be helpful.

361
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:11,595
I'm not a bomb
that's about to explode.

362
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,196
In fact, I didn't want to brag,

363
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:15,302
but I've been put in charge
of morale for the night.

364
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:17,039
By who?

365
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:18,407
I did it.

366
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:22,044
This is the worst situation

367
00:16:22,077 --> 00:16:23,605
you've ever faced in your life,
right?

368
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:25,445
- So far.
- And you'd agree I'm responsible?

369
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:28,280
I 100% disagree.
Jerry Dantana's responsible.

370
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,890
<i>But I have an idea.
I don't know if you heard,</i>

371
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:33,255
but I was recently appointed director
of morale for the night.

372
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:34,757
- Fuck it.
- What do you want from me?

373
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,391
I wanted to know
what the punishment's gonna be this time.

374
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:39,129
- This time?
- I'll be in the control room.

375
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:41,034
What was the punishment
last time?

376
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,062
- Seriously?
- How have--

377
00:16:45,103 --> 00:16:47,797
There's no one in the world--
You were sleeping with--

378
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:50,408
- For four months you were--
- I was fucking my ex-boyfriend.

379
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:51,706
--lying.

380
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,112
And, yeah.

381
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,279
I've never heard you use
that word as a verb before.

382
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:00,879
- I didn't like how it sounded.
- Wasn't a punishment.

383
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:04,188
I broke up with you.
You're the only person who's baffled by why.

384
00:17:04,293 --> 00:17:06,927
I've got news for you.
You're the only person who's not baffled

385
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,135
- why it's six years later.
- I'm unforgiving?

386
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:11,272
So you'll understand my concern
when it comes to Genoa

387
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:13,840
and wrecking your professional life, too,
which, let's face it,

388
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:16,344
you take more seriously
than your personal life anyway.

389
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:18,607
- I'll try to figure out why.
- So what's in store?

390
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,578
You know what, hon?
Can I just say fuck you?

391
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:23,113
- Yeah.
- I've never punished you.

392
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:25,351
King George forgave America

393
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:26,919
in less time
than it's taking you--

394
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:28,615
What is the right
amount of time?

395
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:30,888
You and everyone else
is baffled at six years.

396
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,592
I assume you're
talking about the staff.

397
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,758
How long do you guys think
is the right amount of time?

398
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:37,588
28 months.

399
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:39,626
You seriously
came up with a number?

400
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,927
I was kidding.

401
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,792
- Time?
- Yeah.

402
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:45,864
I'm sorry I didn't
explode for you.

403
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,728
It's a long night.

404
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:52,634
Listen up.

405
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:56,303
We found these pictures today.

406
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,143
This is China.

407
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:00,344
<i>People have their picture taken</i>

408
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,313
<i>pretending to cast a vote.</i>

409
00:18:03,346 --> 00:18:05,912
<i>In India, they're waving flags</i>

410
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:08,582
<i>and having viewing parties
to watch the coverage.</i>

411
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:13,024
In South Korea,
they're watching an electoral map.

412
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,855
<i>A mock ballot box in Senegal.</i>

413
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:20,327
And that's our ambassador
in Hungary hosting a pizza party.

414
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,865
Our elections are the envy
of the world.

415
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:34,452
It's critically important
that we not make any mistakes tonight.

416
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,082
We all know why.

417
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:39,384
Top to bottom, no mistakes.

418
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,686
If you make a mistake,

419
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:45,149
run out of the building
as fast as you can

420
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,356
and keep running
till you hit water.

421
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:50,419
Then swim.

422
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:55,332
Here we go.
Three minutes.

423
00:19:07,578 --> 00:19:08,676
Let's go around the room.

424
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:11,345
Arizona House. Colorado House.
Virginia House.

425
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,072
Game changer states.
Critical states.

426
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:16,544
- I'm not seeing Washington.
- Virginia, Florida, Ohio.

427
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,750
- There you are.
- McCain won Kentucky by 16.

428
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,982
- Graphics.
- Ready.

429
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:22,285
What's the order
of that first whip-around?

430
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:23,853
- Field.
- Standing.

431
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:25,685
- One, two, three.
- Rehearsing two months.

432
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,022
- Just like rehearsal.
- 60 seconds to VTR.

433
00:19:28,055 --> 00:19:30,022
- Nothing's gone right in rehearsal.
- That's defeatist, man.

434
00:19:30,056 --> 00:19:32,430
I'll throw it to DC.
That's how you'll know you were talking too long.

435
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,630
- The fetus?
- Defeatist. Defeatist.

436
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:35,933
You can't hit on the candidate.

437
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,229
If Virginia's Senate
is going red...

438
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:40,362
- Yes, you are.
- There's water right there.

439
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:42,568
<i>- Clear the set, please.</i>
- Thank you.

440
00:19:49,273 --> 00:19:51,105
<i>- Stand by roll-in.</i>
- Standing.

441
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:52,713
- Will?
- Right here.

442
00:19:52,746 --> 00:19:56,206
- You ready?
- No, I need another half hour.

443
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:57,541
Good luck, everyone.

444
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,947
Three, two, roll in.

445
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:09,056
Good evening
from New York City.

446
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:11,463
I'm Will McAvoy
and ACN's prime time coverage

447
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:14,061
of Election Night 2012
begins right now.

448
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:18,256
I'm joined in the studio
by ACN's Sloan Sabbith and Elliot Hirsch

449
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:19,960
as well as Republican
strategist

450
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:23,065
<i>and former Romney campaign
press advisor Taylor Warren.</i>

451
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,298
Standing by in Washington
is Jane Barrow

452
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:26,834
<i>and her team
of political analysts.</i>

453
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:29,103
- <i>It's just past 7:00 P.M. in the East...</i>
- Mac.

454
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:31,670
- <i>and polls have closed in Kentucky, South Carolina...</i>
- Change it up.

455
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:34,007
...Vermont, Virginia, and Indiana.

456
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,776
In the battleground state of Virginia,
ACN is projecting

457
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:38,576
that race too close to call.

458
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:41,151
ACN can project that
the great state of Indiana

459
00:20:41,216 --> 00:20:43,785
and its 11 electoral votes
will go to Mitt Romney.

460
00:20:43,818 --> 00:20:46,554
We can also project
that Mitt Romney will be the winner

461
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:48,963
of Kentucky's
eight electoral votes.

462
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:51,329
We will not have a shutout,
as President Obama...

463
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,162
We're calling Bernie Sanders.

464
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,130
...three electoral votes,
making this

465
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:58,403
the sixth presidential election in a row
for the state to vote blue.

466
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:04,439
Look right here.
Great.

467
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,068
There's a ballot
initiative in LA County

468
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:09,604
that would require actors in adult films
to wear condoms.

469
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,910
I've never been more indifferent
to an issue in my life.

470
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:14,148
- Charlie.
- Excuse me for interrupting.

471
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:15,715
You're not. This is Denise,
Pam, and Connor.

472
00:21:15,748 --> 00:21:17,748
We went to school together.
This is Charlie Skinner.

473
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:20,346
- He's the president of ACN.
- Any predictions?

474
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:21,754
Their phones
were taken at the door.

475
00:21:21,787 --> 00:21:23,354
Obama's gonna take Virginia

476
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:27,056
and we've been looking hard
at some precincts in Ohio and Florida.

477
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:29,961
- Got a minute?
- Excuse me.

478
00:21:32,102 --> 00:21:33,933
- How you doing?
- Hi, Reese.

479
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:36,564
- You understand the suit's gonna be filed in the morning.
- Yeah.

480
00:21:36,637 --> 00:21:39,205
And you understand everyone--
and I mean everyone--

481
00:21:39,238 --> 00:21:42,543
Everyone will have a stringer
waiting at the clerk's office for the complaint.

482
00:21:42,576 --> 00:21:44,078
- Yes.
- You've read a complaint.

483
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:47,581
It's a long list of grievances that go
well beyond the scope

484
00:21:47,614 --> 00:21:50,611
- of any rational definition of relevance.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:54,117
Tomorrow's just an exercise
in public shaming.

486
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:55,789
Yeah, we're gonna be
painted with humiliation--

487
00:21:55,821 --> 00:21:57,852
Mostly you and Will and then Mac
and a little bit me.

488
00:21:57,893 --> 00:22:00,323
So you don't feel
you're foggy on the reality?

489
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:02,458
I wish I were less
aware of the reality.

490
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,690
- I'd like to be stupid right now.
- Good.

491
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:05,130
- Charlie.
- Let me finish.

492
00:22:05,163 --> 00:22:07,298
Aren't you the final arbiter
of whether a race gets called?

493
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:08,330
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't you be downstairs?

494
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:10,129
That's how important it is

495
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,434
that I convince you
to accept my resignation and Will's.

496
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:14,938
I think the election
is pretty important.

497
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:18,241
We're waiting for the next exit poll dump.
I've got a minute.

498
00:22:18,274 --> 00:22:21,041
People have been fired

499
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,114
for making much smaller
mistakes than we did.

500
00:22:23,147 --> 00:22:25,221
People have been incarcerated
for making smaller mistakes.

501
00:22:25,254 --> 00:22:28,522
So there's that, and that's bred
resentment in the industry.

502
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:30,448
- But that's nothing. Forget that.
- Okay.

503
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:34,353
Forget that everything
that's gone on inside the organization

504
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,798
will be laid out on a table
for everyone to scrutinize,

505
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:40,871
which, sure as we're standing here,
is what is going to happen.

506
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:42,008
- Forget that.
- All right.

507
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,576
If a news outlet
doesn't have credibility,

508
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:47,641
it doesn't matter what else it has.
That's a fact.

509
00:22:47,682 --> 00:22:51,986
There are people here from Jane Barrow,
Terry Smith,

510
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,219
everyone at the DC bureau
to Sloan Sabbith,

511
00:22:55,252 --> 00:22:57,059
Elliot Hirsch,
everyone on <i>Dayside</i>,

512
00:22:57,092 --> 00:23:00,595
these people don't deserve
to have a piano strapped to their back.

513
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:02,828
Their credibility
shouldn't--

514
00:23:04,197 --> 00:23:05,638
When did you arrive here?

515
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:07,738
I'm stealthy.

516
00:23:10,744 --> 00:23:13,144
I think it's commendable
and pretty shocking

517
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:15,578
that you want to do something
just because it's the right thing to do,

518
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:17,155
but it's not
the right thing to do.

519
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,851
- I know.
- What do you mean?

520
00:23:18,884 --> 00:23:21,189
I think you were responsible
for a massive fuckup.

521
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:22,990
I think Will was the face
of a massive fuckup.

522
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,062
I think firing
a mid-level producer

523
00:23:25,095 --> 00:23:26,597
appears to be an abdication
of responsibility.

524
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,829
Now we're gonna have to read about
Jim and Maggie and Don

525
00:23:28,862 --> 00:23:30,800
and Jim and Maggie and Don
and Maggie and Mac and Will

526
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:32,706
and did Sloan punch
a guy in the face?

527
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:35,379
- Yeah.
- The train, she is wrecked.

528
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:36,811
Why are you gleeful?

529
00:23:36,844 --> 00:23:39,886
I'm on the right team
for once and I get really paid.

530
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:42,855
Are you saying you agree?

531
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,127
I think your resignation
should be accepted immediately

532
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:47,223
and we should write
Dantana a check and get to the business

533
00:23:47,264 --> 00:23:49,126
of rebooting
this once respected brand.

534
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:50,966
Then why don't you?

535
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,294
My mom says I can't.

536
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:54,801
- Reese!
- I don't know how else to put it.

537
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,414
I talked to her for hours today.
I've been talking to her all night.

538
00:23:57,447 --> 00:23:59,879
I said, "Mom, you're gonna die
and I'm gonna take over a dinged-up company."

539
00:23:59,913 --> 00:24:02,013
And you know what she said?
She said, "I'm never gonna die.

540
00:24:02,046 --> 00:24:03,484
And when are you gonna
give me some grandchildren?

541
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:05,219
Are you gay?
If you're gay, that's fine. Just tell me."

542
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:06,915
- <i>I said, "I'm not gay."</i>
- Look.

543
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,052
<i>"I just haven't met
the right woman yet."</i>

544
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:09,285
She's like,
"Oh, that's bullshit.

545
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:10,653
You met the right woman
three or four times.

546
00:24:10,694 --> 00:24:12,221
You just always find
some problem."

547
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,094
And I was like,
"You're divorced."

548
00:24:14,127 --> 00:24:15,567
- And she said, "That's completely different."
- Reese.

549
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,202
I was like, "What's your obsession
with grandchildren?

550
00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:19,940
- Is it a chance for a do-over?"
- Reese!

551
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:26,809
She's not taking
your resignations.

552
00:24:26,874 --> 00:24:28,315
She's not settling the suit.

553
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:31,053
- I have to go.
- Charlie, I know.

554
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:33,683
And I tried.

555
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:35,353
You have to keep trying.

556
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:37,153
Tomorrow's too late.

557
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:44,792
It'd be a lot easier for me to convince my mother
if you agreed with me.

558
00:24:44,828 --> 00:24:46,726
- But I don't.
- Yeah.

559
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,864
- You were paying me for that whole conversation.
- I know.

560
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:52,803
It's 7:59 in the East

561
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:54,940
and we're ready
to make some calls.

562
00:24:54,972 --> 00:24:56,506
ACN is projecting
that Governor Romney

563
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:59,111
is the winner in the Mountaineer State
of West Virginia.

564
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:00,640
We can also project
at this hour

565
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:02,882
that President Obama
will win in Connecticut,

566
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:05,315
Delaware, and Washington, DC.

567
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:07,893
No surprise here.
The 20 electoral votes

568
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:09,893
from the president's
home state of Illinois

569
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,892
are safely Mr. Obama's,
while the 10 electoral votes

570
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,665
from Mitt Romney's home state
of Massachusetts

571
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:18,100
are also going
to Mr. Obama.

572
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:21,103
I apologize.
I was trapped by my own sentence structure.

573
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:22,439
In Maryland...

574
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:24,272
Six calls plus
five Senate calls.

575
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:26,679
You're gonna give me the calls,
then a quick board on which are too close to call.

576
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:29,280
45 seconds for the impact
for the Latino vote.

577
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:31,981
The jobs,
national security, the 47%.

578
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:33,645
We've got Elliot coming up
in the top half hour.

579
00:25:33,686 --> 00:25:35,686
DC, are you standing by
for the Senate calls?

580
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,455
That's if the Senate turns red.

581
00:25:37,488 --> 00:25:39,055
- Just a nonviolent coup.
- ...Obama off to a good start.

582
00:25:39,088 --> 00:25:40,928
A lot of those states
are starting to fill in blue.

583
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:41,961
We'll take care of business,

584
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:43,433
do the calls, the House races,

585
00:25:43,466 --> 00:25:47,067
and then I'll give you
two minutes for the 47% after Elliot.

586
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,403
- Where is he?
- He's up in his suite.

587
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:51,642
There's a lot of family,
all the boys, grandkids.

588
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,377
- What's the general mood?
- You know you've got a reporter here.

589
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,705
- He's busy.
- So am I.

590
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:57,073
- What's the mood?
- Really good.

591
00:25:57,114 --> 00:25:59,314
It's a party here.
They think they're gonna win Ohio

592
00:25:59,347 --> 00:26:00,914
and then run the table.
Are they?

593
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:02,480
- I don't know anything you don't know.
<i>- Bullshit.</i>

594
00:26:02,513 --> 00:26:03,751
Do you know anything
I don't know?

595
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,215
- You'd hate that, right?
- No.

596
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:06,888
I'd be really happy for you.
Why do people think that--

597
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:09,720
Hey, four quick things.
First, I'm gonna break news tonight.

598
00:26:09,753 --> 00:26:11,391
<i>Second, nah-nah-nah-nah.</i>

599
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:13,889
- Third, hey, Hallie.
- Hey, Maggie.

600
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,595
And fourth, suck it
and we're about to get a data dump.

601
00:26:17,636 --> 00:26:20,695
- I really like your hair.
- Thanks. That's sweet.

602
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,069
- Good luck tonight.
- Thanks.

603
00:26:23,102 --> 00:26:25,472
- I've got to go.
- Wait.

604
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:26,809
- What?
- What happened?

605
00:26:26,842 --> 00:26:28,241
- What do you mean?
<i>- To Maggie's hair.</i>

606
00:26:28,274 --> 00:26:30,144
She cut it, I guess,
and changed the color.

607
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:31,375
You guess
she changed the color?

608
00:26:31,408 --> 00:26:32,877
It was a different
color before.

609
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,907
Yes, it was.
Do you know what color my hair is?

610
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,576
<i>You're looking at it right now.</i>

611
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:37,775
Your hair is
the color of goodness.

612
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:39,877
- You're an idiot.
- It's hazelnut.

613
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,075
That's not a--
When did she cut her hair?

614
00:26:42,108 --> 00:26:43,579
- Last week.
- Why?

615
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:45,379
- I didn't ask.
<i>- You should.</i>

616
00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:48,283
I'll put that on the list
and I'll talk to you in a while.

617
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,516
- My hair's blonde.
- It's really nice.

618
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,115
Good-bye.

619
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:58,057
Recapping the earlier...

620
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,625
All right, you're up.

621
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:02,360
Be yourself.

622
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:05,696
You're a great guy
and the people at home really like you.

623
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:08,264
- Thank you.
- And you're handsome, too,

624
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:10,632
<i>in a droll
and expressionless way.</i>

625
00:27:10,665 --> 00:27:13,134
- Okay.
<i>- You're a welcome presence in our homes.</i>

626
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,606
It's all about locating
your inner cha

627
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:17,471
<i>and not tripping over
any cables.</i>

628
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:19,574
Do you have to be
talking right now?

629
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,174
Have you located the cha?

630
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,077
<i>So we're going to show you.</i>

631
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,444
Elliot Hirsch is standing by
in our newsroom. Elliot?

632
00:27:26,477 --> 00:27:29,252
Will, through these doors
is our decision desk,

633
00:27:29,285 --> 00:27:31,481
which is the entire brain
of the operation.

634
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:34,322
There are eight experts--

635
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,585
PhDs in statistics,

636
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,425
economics,
and political science,

637
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:41,318
and they use computer models
to combine raw votes,

638
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,758
exit polls, sample precincts,
and early voting

639
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:47,095
to project the winners
in each district and state.

640
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,166
This is Kathy Ling.

641
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:50,862
Kathy,
can you tell us anything new?

642
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,667
- No, not yet.
- This is some good television.

643
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,400
The men and women in here
are monitoring...

644
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:01,765
<i>Sprechen jedermann
hier Deutsch?</i>

645
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,500
<i>Ich tun.</i>

646
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:07,740
Not as well as you think.
Come with me.

647
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:09,604
Shit.

648
00:28:11,245 --> 00:28:13,212
The reason for the seclusion
is that we don't want them

649
00:28:13,245 --> 00:28:15,441
to be influenced by calls
that are being made by other networks.

650
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:17,973
When our team here
is ready to make a call,

651
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:21,182
they put it into
a program called iNews.

652
00:28:21,215 --> 00:28:23,445
- Anything?
- It takes a little time.

653
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:26,979
- Okay. As I said, they put the information into iNews...
- Yeah!

654
00:28:27,051 --> 00:28:29,480
...where it's picked up
by one of our producers

655
00:28:29,513 --> 00:28:32,352
at these two desks.

656
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:35,151
They've divided up
the races alphabetically

657
00:28:35,184 --> 00:28:38,159
and each is responsible
for 120 races.

658
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:41,056
After the next commercial,
we'll come back for panel.

659
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:43,760
18-29 is higher than expected,
but so is over 65.

660
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:45,528
I'd say three minutes.
You good?

661
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:47,168
Happy as a cat with kittens.

662
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:48,832
- You've been doing great.
- Thank you.

663
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:50,336
Hey, MacKenzie,
I didn't realize

664
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:52,168
that you were president
of the Oxford Union.

665
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:56,273
You had to have been
one of the first women presidents, right?

666
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:59,083
- Cambridge.
- I'm sorry?

667
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:00,851
I was president
of the Cambridge Union.

668
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:03,485
Oh. Uh-oh, sorry.
That was Wikipedia.

669
00:29:03,518 --> 00:29:05,051
Wikipedia says
I went to Oxford?

670
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:06,321
I think I'm remembering right.

671
00:29:06,355 --> 00:29:07,720
Mac.

672
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:11,562
You're pitching a perfect game.
Let this one go.

673
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:12,859
You don't think
I can let it go?

674
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:14,365
- I wasn't challenging you.
- Oh, I'll let it go.

675
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:15,965
Either way, it's a big honor.

676
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:17,564
Yes, though not either way.
Just one way.

677
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:19,865
- Right.
- Okay.

678
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:22,969
- Can I see you when you're done?
- Sure.

679
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:24,601
- Gary signed your book.
- Here's the thing.

680
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:25,874
- Yeah?
- You forgot to do it

681
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:28,178
and I was put in charge of
something for the benefit.

682
00:29:28,243 --> 00:29:29,779
And I speak a little German,
so I thought

683
00:29:29,812 --> 00:29:31,851
I'll inscribe it,
"I hope you enjoy this book."

684
00:29:31,884 --> 00:29:33,779
And I signed your name
just like you do.

685
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,818
I didn't put a heart
over the I or anything.

686
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:38,786
Wait, is there
an I in your name?

687
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:40,488
Yes.

688
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:42,319
Yes, there is.

689
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:44,486
And you inscribed it
"I hope you shred this book."

690
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,053
Neal has explained that.
What are the chances

691
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:47,621
that whoever bought
the book speaks German?

692
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,027
What are the chances
that you do?

693
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,892
Guys, can we move this
someplace else?

694
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:52,828
I don't care about the German.
I care about the fraud.

695
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:55,597
I need the name and contact information
of the person who bought the book.

696
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,070
Tonight?

697
00:29:57,103 --> 00:29:58,766
You need to hurry before
the trail gets cold.

698
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:02,271
You think the book may have
been bought by a bank robber?

699
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:03,839
- Look at my face.
- I know.

700
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,878
- Does it seem like I want to be sassed?
- It does not.

701
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:09,680
- Enjoy is <i>zerreien.</i>
- That's still shred.

702
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:12,287
We'll go back to Will McAvoy
at the anchor desk. Will?

703
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,253
We'll be back with more
of ACN's coverage

704
00:30:14,286 --> 00:30:16,758
of Election Night 2012 right after this.

705
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:19,856
<i>- Out.</i>
<i>- Two minutes back.</i>

706
00:30:19,897 --> 00:30:21,425
You wanted me?

707
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:22,864
I just wanted to
check in on the site.

708
00:30:22,897 --> 00:30:24,893
We're doing fine.
Everybody's doing fine.

709
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:28,134
Except Sloan who's flipping out because
somebody bought her book

710
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,642
at the Sandy auction on Sunday
and it wasn't really signed by her.

711
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:32,709
It's funny the things
people try to control

712
00:30:32,742 --> 00:30:34,646
when they feel like
they're not in control.

713
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:36,350
I wasn't really listening.

714
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:38,551
- I need you to change my Wikipedia page.
- Sure.

715
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:41,656
I checked and for some reason
it says I was president of the Oxford Union.

716
00:30:41,689 --> 00:30:43,290
- Weren't you?
- No.

717
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:45,596
- I went to Cambridge.
- Right. I knew that.

718
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:47,835
Do you know who else
went to Cambridge?

719
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,032
John Milton, Charles Darwin,

720
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:52,168
Jane Goodall, Alan Turing,

721
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:53,705
E.M. Forster,
Stephen Hawking,

722
00:30:53,738 --> 00:30:55,642
the King of Jordan,
Prime Minister of India,

723
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:58,982
and three signatories
to the Declaration of Independence.

724
00:30:59,015 --> 00:31:00,845
Mac, I wonder if you
can switch me off.

725
00:31:00,918 --> 00:31:02,482
You're screaming names
of smart people in my ear.

726
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:04,575
- Sorry.
- They teach you that at Oxford?

727
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:09,019
- So you'll get that fixed?
- Yeah.

728
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:12,492
- You hear anything back yet?
- No.

729
00:31:12,524 --> 00:31:14,227
It's 8:15.
They've got 15 minutes.

730
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,195
Do you really think your shower buddy
has got a story or is he stalling?

731
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:20,165
I really think he has a story.

732
00:31:20,238 --> 00:31:21,366
<i>15 seconds.</i>

733
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:23,302
All right, we're coming back
with the 47%.

734
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:25,509
You guys ready
to have some fun?

735
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:27,077
- Yeah.
- Okay.

736
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,313
No, no. Are you ready
to have some fun?!

737
00:31:32,155 --> 00:31:34,049
- What the hell is wrong with--
- I don't know.

738
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:36,487
In three, two, roll in.

739
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:41,364
Welcome back to ACN's
continuing coverage

740
00:31:41,393 --> 00:31:42,897
of Election Night 2012.

741
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,662
Let's check in with Florida,
where it's still too close to call.

742
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,365
We have 62% of the vote counted

743
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:50,430
and you can see the president
has an advantage

744
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:52,430
in that very important
battleground state

745
00:31:52,471 --> 00:31:54,703
of roughly 100,000 votes.

746
00:31:54,736 --> 00:31:57,174
Florida, once again,
too close to call at the moment.

747
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,310
Taylor Warren,
what effect, if any,

748
00:31:59,343 --> 00:32:01,912
did the 47% tape have
on the Romney campaign

749
00:32:01,945 --> 00:32:03,513
and on the electorate?

750
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,481
The biggest effect it had
was on the media.

751
00:32:05,554 --> 00:32:06,848
Now we're talking.

752
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,163
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.

753
00:32:15,196 --> 00:32:17,564
I was just leaving you
a note that I need a minute.

754
00:32:18,965 --> 00:32:20,971
- Am I being sued again?
- Yeah.

755
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:23,708
Okay, well, what?

756
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,008
You're going to be
a named defendant

757
00:32:26,048 --> 00:32:28,914
in a separate suit filed tomorrow morning
by Jerry Dantana.

758
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,156
<i>He's seeking
an additional $20 million</i>

759
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:33,252
<i>for tortious interference.</i>

760
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:38,166
What's happening?

761
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,294
Shortly after Jerry left ACN,

762
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,334
he applied for a job
at Kickstarter.

763
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:43,998
I'm sure he was advised
to demonstrate

764
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,172
that due to his wrongful
termination here,

765
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:48,339
it's now impossible for him
to get work elsewhere.

766
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:52,107
A man named Goldman,
Ezra Goldman, called you

767
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,571
about a reference for Jerry?

768
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:55,211
- Mm-hmm.
- And what did you say?

769
00:32:55,245 --> 00:32:58,011
I said, "Ezra, this is the call
I've been waiting my whole life for."

770
00:32:58,084 --> 00:32:59,547
- What else?
- I told him the story.

771
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,948
I told him Jerry knowingly
put a false story on the air

772
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:04,119
about Marines murdering
civilians with sarin gas.

773
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,559
- Anything else?
- Probably.

774
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:08,063
Think.

775
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,030
I said, "If your company needs a very
hardworking sociopath, then Jerry's your man."

776
00:33:11,063 --> 00:33:13,165
- Right there.
- No, he's a hardworking guy.

777
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,933
Under New York state law,
tortious interference results

778
00:33:15,998 --> 00:33:18,502
if you intentionally interfere
with a potential business relationship

779
00:33:18,535 --> 00:33:20,175
by acting solely out of malice

780
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,841
or through improper
or dishonest means.

781
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:24,282
- Wait.
- Sure.

782
00:33:24,312 --> 00:33:26,509
He's suing me for giving him
a bad job recommendation?

783
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:28,148
For saying something
that wasn't true.

784
00:33:28,213 --> 00:33:29,515
It's not a dispute
he doctored the tape.

785
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:31,645
And if all you said was that,
you'd be fine.

786
00:33:31,686 --> 00:33:33,183
But you called him a sociopath.

787
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:35,919
- He is.
- Sociopath is a clinical term.

788
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,557
How much training
as a psychiatric diagnostician

789
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,926
did you get at
the Columbia School of Journalism?

790
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:43,065
- Not that much.
- Yeah.

791
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:46,034
So, you see, you've got to talk to me
before you say things.

792
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,802
It was plainly not--

793
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,074
I didn't say he's a sociopath.

794
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:53,507
- What did you say?
- I said, you know--

795
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:55,579
I said,
"Ezra, he's a sociopath."

796
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,114
- Yeah.
- Why in the world-- in the world

797
00:33:57,147 --> 00:33:58,649
would he put me down
as a reference?

798
00:33:58,683 --> 00:34:01,016
So that this would happen.

799
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,456
Is this a joke?
You making one of your funny jokes?

800
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:07,657
If I was joking, you'd be laughing.
Are you laughing?

801
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,722
- No.
- Then there you have it.

802
00:34:09,795 --> 00:34:11,763
- I just answered the phone.
- It's just strategy.

803
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:13,933
- They want the company to settle.
- How much is this gonna cost?

804
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:15,732
Well, if you lose, $20 million.

805
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:17,467
If you win, only a couple
of hundred thousand.

806
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,899
I don't have a couple
of hundred thousand.

807
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,541
- Do you own your apartment or rent?
- I own it.

808
00:34:21,574 --> 00:34:23,649
Second mortgage.
Problem solved.

809
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:29,517
You are a member of a godless,
soulless race of extortionists.

810
00:34:31,253 --> 00:34:33,750
That's fair.

811
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:38,261
Okay.

812
00:34:38,294 --> 00:34:41,556
The liberal media bias is so clear
that it's not worth arguing about.

813
00:34:41,597 --> 00:34:43,692
What I'd like
to focus on instead--

814
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:46,627
Hang on just a second 'cause I don't think
I can let you float an allegation

815
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,932
like that and then pretend
it's so well agreed upon that it's past debate.

816
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:53,406
The media overwhelmingly voted
for and is voting for Obama.

817
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:55,408
I have a hunch this isn't
gonna be the last time

818
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:58,216
I ask you this tonight,
but any evidence for that?

819
00:34:58,249 --> 00:35:02,088
Yes. A survey conducted
by the American Society of Newspaper Editors

820
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:05,255
showed 61% stated
that they were members of

821
00:35:05,288 --> 00:35:07,189
or shared the beliefs
of the Democratic Party

822
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:11,758
while 15% said that their beliefs
were best supported by the Republican Party.

823
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,464
Can I raise what I think

824
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,329
- is an interesting example of something?
- Sure.

825
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,094
In a race for the Kansas
State Legislature...

826
00:35:17,135 --> 00:35:19,668
- Oh, seriously?
- ...the Democrat is an anti-gay,

827
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,733
- anti-abortion train conductor.
- Nope.

828
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:24,239
Pardon me. The Republican is
a train conductor and gay.

829
00:35:24,272 --> 00:35:25,913
- No.
- Guys.

830
00:35:25,944 --> 00:35:27,509
Somebody's a train conductor,

831
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,674
<i>somebody's gay and somebody's father
is in the Klan.</i>

832
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:32,107
And what's that an example of?

833
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:33,812
Elliot?

834
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:37,115
Nothing.
So, Taylor, back to your point

835
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:40,019
<i>and your
15-year-old survey.</i>

836
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:42,790
- Jim.
- Yeah?

837
00:35:42,823 --> 00:35:45,023
They want you
at the decision desk.

838
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:52,197
Somebody need me?

839
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,869
Will called the Michigan
first for Dan Benishek?

840
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,206
If you called it, he called it.

841
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,102
We didn't call it
and he called it.

842
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,605
What are you talking about?

843
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,308
In the scroll, you've got
Michigan one going red

844
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:02,569
and we haven't called
Michigan one.

845
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:04,240
Hang on.

846
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:08,313
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

847
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:10,250
You remember a few minutes ago when
my iNews was overloaded

848
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:12,080
and I wrote down some calls
on a legal pad?

849
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:14,582
- It's right here.
- What did I say?

850
00:36:14,616 --> 00:36:16,647
New Hampshire one,
North Carolina three,

851
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:18,319
Ohio seven, Michigan one.

852
00:36:18,352 --> 00:36:20,554
Can I see that?

853
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:25,062
That's supposed
to be Mississippi.

854
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,155
- It's MI.
- Yeah.

855
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:30,164
MI is Michigan.

856
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:32,196
Martin, can you get
Kathy Ling out here?

857
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,397
- You have to go in there.
- I can't have this particular conversation in there.

858
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:35,668
- What happened?
- Can you get her?

859
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:38,600
- She's not allowed out--
- Blindfold her.

860
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:45,103
Just very quickly,
my fault or your fault?

861
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:46,742
- Assigning blame isn't the productive--
- Good.

862
00:36:46,775 --> 00:36:48,670
- I meant Mississippi.
- That's MISS.

863
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:50,038
- It certainly is.
- Michigan's MI.

864
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,312
That's why I gave them Michigan.
MI one red.

865
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:54,450
Come on.

866
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:55,849
<i>Careful.</i>

867
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:57,686
- So, Kathy.
- Yes.

868
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,514
Over here.
We made a small mistake.

869
00:37:00,547 --> 00:37:02,983
We called Michigan
when we meant Mississippi.

870
00:37:03,016 --> 00:37:05,351
- You have to retract it.
- I wonder...

871
00:37:05,384 --> 00:37:08,750
- It's not ready to call.
- I wonder if maybe it's not necessary to retract.

872
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:11,725
It's both too close and too early to call.
You have to retract it.

873
00:37:11,758 --> 00:37:14,189
Let me ask you something
just out of curiosity.

874
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:16,861
What does your data say
about the Michigan first?

875
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:20,133
- Republican incumbent--
- Over here.

876
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:23,104
- Republican incumbent--
- You can just take that off.

877
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:25,609
Don't look at the monitors.

878
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,208
Dan Benishek
will keep his seat.

879
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:28,576
- You're confident of that?
- Yes.

880
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:31,009
- Scale of one to 10.
- 10.

881
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:34,046
Well, then, you know,
we called it.

882
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:36,446
- Are you kidding?
- You're confident he's going to win?

883
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:37,782
- Yes.
- Then why haven't you called it?

884
00:37:37,815 --> 00:37:39,783
It's both too close
and too early to call.

885
00:37:39,856 --> 00:37:41,992
- But you're confident Benishek is gonna win?
- Benishek is going to win.

886
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:43,455
- You're confident?
- He's already won.

887
00:37:43,488 --> 00:37:44,926
- But we can't call it?
- Too close and too early.

888
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:47,158
I appreciate that science
has a very high bar

889
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,830
for what it's willing
to call a fact, but--

890
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:51,295
Benishek is going
to win 51-49.

891
00:37:51,332 --> 00:37:53,567
- 51-49.
- That's not as close as--

892
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,334
- It's exactly as close as it sounds.
- Okay.

893
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:59,641
Okay. You can go back.
Thanks.

894
00:37:59,706 --> 00:38:02,380
- You'll retract the call?
- We will get to that, yes.

895
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,953
- We shouldn't--
- So we called it a little early.

896
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:11,853
We have Joey take it off the scroll
and make sure

897
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:14,257
that nobody mentions it again
until the desk gives the green light.

898
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,554
- Who's going to notice?
- Benishek.

899
00:38:15,595 --> 00:38:17,122
His campaign manager.
The Internet.

900
00:38:17,163 --> 00:38:19,459
- I can steer this.
- Just have Mac have Will retract the call.

901
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,761
This is the written test
you have to take and pass

902
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,801
to work for the New York
City Department of Sanitation.

903
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:29,674
And it goes to the first person
who eats it tonight.

904
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:31,671
But so far, so good.

905
00:38:35,976 --> 00:38:38,913
- We can't retract the call.
- Yeah, I really think we can't retract.

906
00:38:38,978 --> 00:38:40,650
It doesn't seem to me
that conservatives

907
00:38:40,683 --> 00:38:43,051
are having trouble gaining
access to the airwaves.

908
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:46,521
And the fact that the <i>New York Times</i>
editorial board endorsed

909
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:48,688
the president
and not Governor Romney

910
00:38:48,721 --> 00:38:51,021
isn't of itself a sign of bias.

911
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:53,156
When the governor said,
"I like to fire people,"

912
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:56,425
not only did you know exactly what he meant,
but you agreed.

913
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,658
And when the president said,
"You didn't build that,"

914
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:00,330
not only did you know
exactly what he meant,

915
00:39:00,363 --> 00:39:01,826
you knew that's not
what he said.

Eastwood at the convention.

918
00:39:06,104 --> 00:39:08,312
- Okay.
- And while we're on the subject,

919
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:11,007
ACN's star anchor
is a Republican

920
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:12,907
<i>who spends an awful
lot of airtime</i>

921
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,674
reporting stories about
crazy Republicans being crazy.

922
00:39:15,715 --> 00:39:19,082
In fairness, he did anchor a report
about a Democratic president

923
00:39:19,115 --> 00:39:22,185
committing war crimes,
and that wasn't even true.

924
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:24,121
Elephant in the room.

925
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:28,724

He doesn't have much time.

930
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:41,066
Did you ever think you'd be trying to convince
someone to let you resign?

931
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:43,906
No.

932
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:47,183
Will's not gonna fire you, Mac.
There's no way.

933
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:50,585
And it would look like we were
scapegoating you just like Jerry.

934
00:39:50,618 --> 00:39:52,854
- I know.
- You good?

935
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:54,623
- Yeah.
<i>- Mac.</i>

936

937
00:39:56,857 --> 00:39:58,762
- Did you change it?
- I did.

938
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:00,563
- Thank you.
- And they changed it back.

939
00:40:00,596 --> 00:40:02,238
What do you mean
they changed it back?

940
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:03,774
The original creator,
the page administrator,

941
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:05,502
- reviewed and denied the changes.
- Why?

942
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:07,310
- Because-- Because--
- Why? Why did they do that?

943
00:40:07,343 --> 00:40:10,480
Well, I e-mailed him and explained who I was,
that you were my boss

944
00:40:10,513 --> 00:40:13,752
and that you have an expert understanding
of where you did and didn't go to school,

945
00:40:13,785 --> 00:40:15,287
- and I got a very quick reply.
- Saying?

946
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,622
It's Wikipedia's policy
not to use information

947
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:20,149
that comes directly from
the source of the article.

948
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,158
- Say that again?
- It's Wikipedia's--

949
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:25,426
- Can't anyone edit a page?
- Yes. Except you.

950
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:27,297
- So they won't allow firsthand information?
- No.

951
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,337
Seems sort of counterintuitive,
doesn't it?

952
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,244
- I know how you feel.
- I don't think you do.

953
00:40:34,277 --> 00:40:36,910
Because no one's out there

954
00:40:36,943 --> 00:40:39,646
saying you were president
of the Oxford Union

955
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,350
when you were president
of the Cambridge Union,

of the fucking kingdom.

957
00:40:43,856 --> 00:40:46,593
- And that kingdom's been around a long time.
- Don't I know it.

958
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:48,794
I don't even know
if that was a sarcastic

959
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:50,896
geopolitical reference
to colonialism or not.

960
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:52,493
- It wasn't.
- Good.

961
00:40:52,526 --> 00:40:54,366
Good, 'cause, Neal, this is it.

962
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:57,567
We're gonna get this right.
And I'll tell you why.

963
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,799
Because.

964
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:02,777
Mac, I get it.

965
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,412
And I'm gonna get it fixed.

966
00:41:04,477 --> 00:41:06,350
Thank you.
Ruling India was wrong.

967
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:08,984

968
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:11,359

But right now,
the story is in Ohio

972
00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:20,798
where the president
has a 16-point lead over Mr. Romney

<i>with just about a quarter
of the votes counted.</i>

974
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:25,871
But to be very clear,
that race is still too early to call,

975
00:41:25,904 --> 00:41:27,975
<i>meaning that the experts

Even as it was coming out of my mouth,

your personal politics into it.

991
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,808
Yeah, it's okay.
But I'd appreciate it if you kept me out of it.

992
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:02,808

No.

You should enjoy it.

1020
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,688
In the old days,
didn't they offer you the option

1021
00:43:27,753 --> 00:43:29,320
of a shot of whiskey
and a pistol?

1022
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:32,823
- How old?
- Like...

1023
00:43:32,856 --> 00:43:35,326
- the Holy Roman Empire.
- With whiskey and pistols?

1024
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,801
It wouldn't necessarily
look like scapegoating.

1025
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,404
- Mac.
- It would look like you and Charlie

1026
00:43:40,437 --> 00:43:42,174
took the necessary
and appropriate steps

1027

to address the mistake.

1028
00:43:45,444 --> 00:43:46,673
- Can I tell you something?
- Fire me.

1029
00:43:46,706 --> 00:43:48,335
You're the only one
who can do it.

1030
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,114
I was a really good boyfriend.

1031
00:43:56,548 --> 00:43:58,650
I know that.
I never said you weren't.

1032
00:43:58,683 --> 00:44:00,449
- You sort of did.
- That's wrong.

1033
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,823
You think--

1034
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:05,024
you think I'm not firing you

1035
00:44:05,057 --> 00:44:07,193
because it would
make me look bad?

1036
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:09,096
That crossed your mind?

1037
00:44:09,128 --> 00:44:10,463
Give me a break, Billy.

1038
00:44:10,496 --> 00:44:12,200
It's not like you're
indifferent to your image.

1039
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,899
You think it's--
my image?

1040
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,974
What have I ever done
to deserve that?

1041
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:19,709
How big a dick
do you think I am

1042
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:21,642
and how long
have you thought it?

1043
00:44:27,548 --> 00:44:29,683

1054
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:05,158
- Brody in California condemned Todd Akin.
- Yeah?

1055
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:07,557
Taylor Warren pointed me
to a speech he made in 1990

1056
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:10,160
to a student group where he said the exact
same thing, only worse.

1057
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:12,370
I called his chief of staff for a comment--
a guy named John Webb.

1058
00:45:12,403 --> 00:45:14,571
- Webb and I know each other.
- They're in love.

1059
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:16,937
Just--
he asked me for time

1060
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,037
because he said he needed permission
to trade me a story he promised was much bigger.

1061
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,206
- Did you set a deadline?
- Yes.

1062
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,439
- For when?
- For now. He just called.

1063
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:23,879
And this is where you came in.

1064
00:45:23,912 --> 00:45:25,744
If we agree to hold off
reporting the 1990 speech,

1065
00:45:25,777 --> 00:45:27,983
he'll give us two
on-the-record sources.

1066
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,045
As long as it's
not a potentially libelous story

1067
00:45:30,078 --> 00:45:33,054
about misconduct in the armed forces,
I'm listening.

1068
00:45:35,595 --> 00:45:38,333
David Patraeus is about to resign over
an extramarital affair

1069
00:45:38,366 --> 00:45:40,627
with his biographer,
a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve.

1070
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:49,743
And the commander
of US forces in Afghanistan

1071
00:45:49,776 --> 00:45:52,416
will be investigated
with regard to a relationship

1072
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,215
with a Florida socialite
who was receiving

1073
00:45:54,248 --> 00:45:57,246
harassing e-mails from
General Patraeus's mistress.

1074
00:46:08,128 --> 00:46:10,830
I mean, what the fuck?!

1075
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:28,180
Three minutes for the calls,
then a 90 whip-around.

1076
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:30,747
And we'll go to Jane
to look at the Senate.

1077
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,787
Remember what I said before
about my personal politics?

1078
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,583
- Sure.
- Forget it.

1079
00:46:35,648 --> 00:46:37,047
Take me apart.
