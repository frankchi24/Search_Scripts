1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:03,839
I'm gonna pull you from
the 9/11 anniversary coverage.

2
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:06,108
Let me know who to put
on the Romney bus for a couple of weeks.

3
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:08,711
I was thinking we could
go back to the way things were.

4
00:00:08,746 --> 00:00:10,814
I don't want to go back
to the way things were.

5
00:00:10,848 --> 00:00:12,115
- I'll go.
- Where?

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,752
- New Hampshire.
- Say hello to Jerry Dantana.

7
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:16,688
Jerry's up from DC
to cover for Jim.

8
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:18,423
Are you very sure
you want to pitch this?

9
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:21,493
11 weeks ago, the domain name
Occupy Wall Street was registered.

10
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:23,930
And is there a list of incoherent
and unrealistic demands?

11
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:26,633
Your cousin sent me an e-mail
with a link to a YouTube video.

12
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:28,869
- Please let me explain.
- I spent this whole time

13
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,105
thinking I was a bad guy
for not being in love with you.

14
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,074
I don't think there's an immoral way
to kill terrorists.

15
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:35,344
- There's an illegal way and we're doing it.
- I don't care.

16
00:00:35,378 --> 00:00:37,480
Because you were taken off
the 9/11 anniversary coverage?

17
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:40,250
Yes!
I'm flipping out!

18
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:42,719
- I'm gonna give you a story now.
- What kind of story?

19
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:45,122
The kind that makes careers
and ends presidencies.

20

<i>This president
is on track to lose more jobs</i>

22
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:06,114
<i>than any other president

23
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:08,817
<i>We simply have to have
an administration</i>

24
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:11,720
<i>which has as its leader a person

<i>affect the creation of jobs.</i>

28
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,699
- Hey, Cameron.
- Good morning, sir.

29
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:25,235
Come on, man,
you can't keep me off the bus again.

30
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:26,837
According to Taliban law,
I think I'm allowed

31
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:29,272
to run over your face with the bus
while making your sister drink Clorox.

32
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:31,675
- Let's leave sisters out of this.
- You're right about that.

33
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,177
- I can go on the bus?
- No, sir.

34
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:34,645
You guys are running
for president.

35
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:36,247
You're gonna have to
get used to bad press.

36
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,982
As a Republican campaign,

37
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,617
what kind of experience
would we have with bad press?

38
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:42,052
- Yeah...
- How would we build up that part of our immune system?

39
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:44,388
Cameron, straight up,
the story I file today

40
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:45,822
will be about how the governor

41
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:47,791
wouldn't let an ACN reporter
on the press bus.

42
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:50,360
And he'll experience
a five-point bump in the polls.

43
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:51,861
- Cameron?
- Yeah?

44
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:53,797
Let him on the bus.

45
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:55,432
Go ahead.

46
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,535
Thank you.

47
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:15,886
Thanks.

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,655
Just want to get going.

49
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,324
I'm Jim Harper, ACN.

50
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:23,093
How's Ben's ankle?

51
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:25,061
It's broken.

52
00:03:32,336 --> 00:03:33,870
- The reporters were freed in Libya.
<i>- We're reading it.</i>

53
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:35,672
<i>- It's in the </i>Guardian<i>.</i>
- We've all got it.

54
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:37,340
</i>Headline:
"Journalists freed from Rixos Hotel</i>

55
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,642
<i>after being held
by Gaddafi gunmen."</i>

56
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,843
<i>Stillman, we're all reading it.</i>

57
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:41,211
"The group were freed
shortly after they--"

58
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:42,612
Seriously, Stillman!

59
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:44,314
<i>We're reading the exact
same thing you are saying.</i>

60
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,749

64
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,561
<i>So, great news,
as far as we're concerned.</i>

65
00:03:57,595 --> 00:03:59,763
<i>But the battle
for Tripoli and...</i>

66
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:02,131
- It's me.
<i>- Are you all right?</i>

67
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,534
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

68
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:05,836
Yes, totally.

69
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,739
- Did you sleep here?
- I came in early this morning.

70
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:11,507
It's 6:00 AM.

71
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:16,145
I'm moving back in with Lisa.

72
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,347
I didn't really want
anyone to see the bags.

73
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:21,150
So would it be all right if I kept them here
till the end of the day?

74
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,551
What happened?

75
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:24,019
Don and I split up.

76
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:25,787
Did he kick you out
in the middle--

77
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:27,489
No. No.

78
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:28,957
He went to a hotel.

79
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:30,892
Then I couldn't sleep,
so I just packed some stuff and came in.

80
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:32,927
- You should call him. Take the--
- I've called him.

81
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:35,263
I've called him a lot.
He's not taking my calls.

82
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:37,299
It's 6:00 AM.
He could be sleeping.

83
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,700
If it goes to voice mail
after two rings,

84
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:40,502
they saw your name
and sent you to voice mail.

85
00:04:40,536 --> 00:04:42,537
- Really?
- Four rings, they're not there.

86
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:44,673
Two rings,
they don't want to talk to you.

87
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:46,742
All right,
I have to retrace my entire life now.

88
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:48,277
But, you know,
you and Don--

89
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:50,245
It was all me.
It was me.

90
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:53,782
Is it okay if we don't
talk about it?

91
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:55,050
Yeah.

92
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:56,986
I'm going down to the gym.
You wanna come?

93
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,587
- Uh, no.
- Yeah.

94
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,089
Come take a shower
and we'll get breakfast.

95
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:01,824
The reporters are free,
the ones from CNN--

96
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,392
Yeah, I saw.
Come on.

97
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,135
Yeah?

98
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:13,636
I need to tell you a story

99
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:15,772
Cyrus West told me
last night after the panel.

100
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:17,240
Cyrus West question mark?

101
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:19,142
- Hmm, ellipses.
- I booked a bad guest.

102
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,311
How long do you guys
give people shit in New York?

103
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:25,182
Ask A-Rod. What story did Cyrus West
tell you after the panel?

104
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:28,051
Have you ever heard anything
about a black op called Genoa?

105
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:30,421
- <i>Operation Genoa?</i>
- Like the salami?

106
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,457
Yeah, except it's named
for a kind of sail on a boat.

107
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:37,561
- No.
- All right, well, uh, this is gonna sound--

108
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:40,064
I get that this
is gonna sound crazy,

109
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:43,800
but West says about a year ago,
there was a MARSOC extraction

110
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:45,402
just across the border
in Pakistan.

111
00:05:45,436 --> 00:05:47,471
Two of our guys
were being held in a village

112
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:49,706
along with civilians,
including women and children.

113
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,276
And he says we used sarin gas.

114
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,112
What made you think
that was gonna sound crazy?

115
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,947
- I know that it's probably--
- Sarin gas?

116
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,315
- <i>On civilians?</i>
- During an extraction.

117
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,084
The first team of MARSOCs
were overrun by Taliban fighters

118
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,386
and a second wave of Marines
came in on a helicopter

119
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:04,888
a minute later and dropped gas.

120
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,691
- Sarin gas?!
- Shh!

121
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:12,463
What you're describing
would have involved about 50 people.

122
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,432
15 on the first wave,
15 on the second wave,

123
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:17,301
a ground crew to load
the gas on the helos.

124
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,136
What 50 people
could keep that secret?

125
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,904
- You know the name of the shooter in Abbottabad?
<i>- No.</i>

126
00:06:20,938 --> 00:06:22,472
Those 50 people, to start with.

127
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,508
<i>You think SEALs are better at
keeping a secret than MARSOCs?</i>

128
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,610
They're protecting the shooter's safety;
they didn't use nerve gas.

129
00:06:26,644 --> 00:06:28,278
I can't believe we're
talking about nerve gas.

130
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:29,947
- <i>Do I have to go on?</i>
- Mind if I ask you something?

131
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:32,215
- <i>No.</i>
- If I was Jim, would you be paying attention?

132
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:35,185
I am paying attention.

133
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,388
J.D., you don't have to feel
competitive with Jim.

134
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:40,091
Good, 'cause I was asked
to come fill in for him.

135
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,194
I really don't want
to get calls from our DOD sources

136
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,229
asking why we're pursuing
a libelous story.

137
00:06:45,264 --> 00:06:46,797
Can you assume
that I'm good at this?

138
00:06:46,832 --> 00:06:48,199
Can you assume
the D.C. Bureau

139
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:50,000
didn't hire a senior producer
who's an idiot?

140
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,135
- I never said--
- Can you do that?

141
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:58,975
- Make your calls.
- Thank you.

142
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,512
'Cause on the off chance
it turns out to be true--

143
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:04,414
I'll be there to see you
accept your Peabody.

144
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:07,016
- That wasn't even close to what I was gonna say.
- Lighten up, man.

145
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,751
On the off chance
it turns out to be true,

146
00:07:08,786 --> 00:07:10,220
people are gonna
have to resign.

147
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:13,890
Jerry, you're talking
about a massive war crime.

148
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:16,058
<i>On the off chance
it turns out to be true,</i>

149
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:18,194
people would have
to go to prison.

150
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:22,731
Will asked me to come get you.

151
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:24,733
What was it supposed
to be called again?

152
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:29,037
You can say whatever you want
in front of anyone who works here.

153
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:31,072
- That's why they work here.
- Genoa.

154
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:33,608
- Like the city.
- Like the headsail on a boat.

155
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:37,545
- Cool. Anything else?
- Nope.

156
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:42,784
- Why's your hair all wet?
- They don't have blow dryers in the gym.

157
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:45,487
Do you have a minute today
when Gary and I could pitch you Africa?

158
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:47,289
You can't pitch me Africa.
It's a huge place.

159
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:50,192
You've got to be specific.
That's what's wrong with your pitches.

160
00:07:50,226 --> 00:07:52,461
- Good morning.
- Oh, I'm really glad you're here.

161
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:54,462
Elliot and Sloan
have been talking about closets for--

162
00:07:54,497 --> 00:07:56,298
We're well into
our sixth minute now.

163
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:58,801
My wife has always dreamed
of having a walk-in closet,

164
00:07:58,835 --> 00:08:00,636
so I've hired a contractor
and I'm building her one.

165
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,670
- Have you ever built an extension on your house?
- Never had a house.

166
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:05,139
- It's like Vietnam-- You can't get out.
- Is it going to be great?

167
00:08:05,174 --> 00:08:06,407
- The closet?
- Yeah.

168
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:08,075
On paper, in theory, yeah.

169
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,313
It's supposed to have
a whole shoe emporium and a vanity

170
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:12,781
and a little step stool
and a sunken, uh--

171
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:14,750
- Minute seven.
- Don't stop.

172
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:16,986
See, this is what I'm talking about--
Women and closets.

173
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,655
What about men and showers?

174
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,257
I've got an awesome shower.
I love my shower.

175
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,892
Where is she keeping her clothes
in the meantime?

176
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:23,761
- My closet.
- And where are you keeping your clothes?

177
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,396
- The shower.
- Oh, dude.

178
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,998
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

179
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:28,533
Do you want to do this or me?

180
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:29,800
- Go ahead.
- Will's been--

181
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:31,235
- I should tell 'em.
- What's going on?

182
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:32,570
The two of you
are going to anchor

183
00:08:32,604 --> 00:08:35,406
the 9/11 anniversary coverage.
I've been taken off.

184
00:08:36,374 --> 00:08:37,575
What are you talking about?

185
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,511
- Oh, fuck that!
- No way.

186
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:41,946
- Hang on.
- Reese took you off?

187
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,881
It wasn't Reese
and it wasn't Leona.

188
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:45,782
It was me.
It was my decision.

189
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,784
Then we'll sit here until
we've talked you out of it.

190
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,553
- Nobody leaves.
- That sounds like something I'd enjoy, but--

191
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:52,856
- Why?
- In about an hour, I'm going to be

192
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,658
officially condemned
on the floor of the House.

193
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:56,993
We. <i>We're</i> going to be
officially condemned.

194
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:58,929
- We all did the broadcast.
- We know about that.

195
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:00,497
There are boycotts
and protestors,

196
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,232
and Reese got kicked out
of a SOPA meeting,

197
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:05,369
and mostly there are 9/11 widows
and widowers and first responders--

198
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:07,304
What, like,
seven first responders out of hundreds?

199
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,573
- If all it is is one--
- There's always gonna be one.

200
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,608
I'm bad news right now.

201
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:13,677
When I called the Tea Party
the American Taliban,

202
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:16,647
there were people who thought
I was being reductive about the Taliban,

203
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,148
and the 9/11
anniversary isn't--

204
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,750
How were you being reductive
about the Taliban?

205
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,751
The Tea Party doesn't
throw acid at people.

206
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:23,620
- <i>But that's not the point.</i>
- What is the point?

207
00:09:23,655 --> 00:09:26,356
The point is I'm not
who I used to be right now.

208
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:30,895
It's not right that
I inflict myself on a profound...

209
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:32,396
- Jesus.
- national day of mourning.

210
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,532
So on the 9th or 10th,
I'm going to get the flu,

211
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,901
and you guys
are gonna take my desk.

212
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,438
That's it.
It's not a big deal.

213
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:41,939
All right?

214
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:45,009
I'll give you any help you need,
but you'll nail it.

215
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:48,479
- Anything else?
- No.

216
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:57,287
It wasn't your decision,
it was Charlie's.

217
00:09:57,321 --> 00:09:59,789
- I know, I was just saving--
- Charlie doesn't need you to protect him from--

218
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,491
- I wasn't protecting Charlie.
- Why didn't you just tell them?

219
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,626
It's embarrassing.

220
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,698
Right.

221
00:10:18,877 --> 00:10:20,544
<i>Excuse me.</i>

222
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,813
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name before.
- Hallie.

223
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,648
Would you mind
just framing me up?

224
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:26,083
Sure.

225
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:35,292
- Am I good?
- Yeah, go ahead.

226
00:10:36,561 --> 00:10:39,029
Governor Romney began
a 36-hour campaign swing

227
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:41,265
through the Granite State
here at the Rec Center

228
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,966
in Keene, New Hampshire,
where questions

229
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:44,769
ranging from
Mr. Romney's health care--

230
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:46,770
that camera is pointed
nowhere near my face, right?

231
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:48,739
We're competitors.

232
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:03,421
Troy Davis.

233
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,456
I think he's going
to get clemency.

234
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,924
- <i>I don't.</i>
- Why?

235
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,127
He's a black guy accused of
killing a white cop in Georgia.

236
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,762
That hardly ever goes well
for the black guy.

237
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,330
He's not accused,
he's convicted.

238
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:14,166
And it didn't turn out great
for the white cop, either.

239
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,900
- He spent 20 years in a cell--
- I know.

240
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:17,269
- Seven of the nine witnesses...
- I know.

241
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,503
have recanted their testimony,

242
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:20,005
- <i>and of the two left, one of them...</i>
- Don.

243
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,373
is the primary
alternate suspect.

244
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,041
I've been covering the story,
just like you.

245
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,843
- Not just like me.
- You're right.

246
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:26,144
I've been covering it
for nine years.

247
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,312
I go down there
every six months.

248
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:29,414
We write letters.
I know the man.

249
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:30,649
There's reasonable doubt
all over the place,

250
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:31,983
and in three weeks,
we're gonna kill him.

251
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:34,419
- Unless he gets clemency.
- Unless he gets clemency.

252
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:35,988
So can I suggest something?

253
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:37,723
- More coverage?
- Different coverage.

254
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:39,758
As a former prosecutor,
you can walk us

255
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,960
through the trial and the appellate process
like nobody else.

256
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,962
- <i>The pressure that was put on the DA's office...</i>
- Listen.

257
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:46,464
for an indictment,
how that can motivate them to take the path--

258
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,133
No.

259
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,304
- Just no?
- He had a trial and the jury reached a verdict.

260
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,139
Half of those jurors say
they've changed their minds.

261
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,974
He was granted an appeal
and the upper court decided--

262
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:58,543
- Burden of proof on appeal is set so high...
<i>- I know.</i>

263
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:00,579
that seven of the nine witnesses
recanting didn't matter.

264
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:02,048
And now he gets
a clemency hearing,

265
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,783
and then he can try his luck
with the Supreme Court.

266
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:06,252
He's received, and is receiving,
due process.

267
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:07,720
It's not right for me
to re-litigate the case.

268
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:09,922
That's a thin argument
when a guy's life is on the line.

269
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:11,890
No, it's not.
20 years have passed.

270
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:13,625
Witnesses get fuzzy.
They feel bad.

271
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,594
They're hounded by
reporters and activists

272
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:17,596
and "What if I fucked up?"
nightmares.

273
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,798
And as a former prosecutor,
I'd be pissed as hell

274
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:21,800
if some guy with an anchor desk
and an audience

275
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:23,535
started
second-guessing my--

276
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:27,973
Can you imagine how little I give a shit
about the prosecutor's feelings?

277
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:29,675
With the presumption
of innocence,

278
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:31,944
a jury of his peers
reached a verdict

279
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:33,779
and found him guilty.

280
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:35,314
And then they
looked him in the eye

281
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:36,948
and sentenced him to death.

282
00:12:36,983 --> 00:12:38,684
Did Troy have
the best possible legal counsel?

283
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:41,086
- No, but on appeal--
- On appeal he was represented

284
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,988
by the Georgia Resource Center,

285
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:44,790
which stated in an affidavit

286
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:47,859
that the work that they were doing
on his behalf was akin to triage.

287
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:50,262
"We were simply trying
to avert total disaster

288
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:54,533
rather than provide any kind of effective
or active representation."

289
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,437
In your file,
you have a commendation

290
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:00,839
from Judge Bernard Sittenfeld
of the Brooklyn Criminal Court.

291
00:13:00,873 --> 00:13:02,941
- Mm-hmm.
- You approached the bench and you said, "Your Honor,

292
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:05,477
I can win this case,
but only because I can beat the public defender.

293
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:08,079
I'm no longer convinced that the accused is guilty,
and I'm making a motion--"

294
00:13:08,114 --> 00:13:09,881
It was my case and my decision.

295
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:13,350
Look, I get that you want a pro-death penalty
crime fighter making noise,

296
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:15,519
but there's a difference
between reporting a story

297
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:17,154
and advocating
for a cop killer.

298
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:19,256
- Alleged.
- Not alleged, convicted.

299
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,591
- Do you see any reasonable doubt?
- I don't get a vote.

300
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,560
- I'm just asking if you see any reasonable--
- Of course I do.

301
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,238
Okay.

302
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:49,452
- Wanna see some company history?
- What is it?

303
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:51,755
Will at the anchor desk
on 9/11.

304
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,391
- His first time in the chair.
- He picked a hell of a day.

305
00:13:54,426 --> 00:13:55,759
He didn't pick it.

306
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,461
Dan Marsh was grounded
in Chicago

307
00:13:57,495 --> 00:13:58,996
- and the other guy, Ed--
- Ed Wyatt.

308
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,264
Wyatt couldn't cross a bridge.

309
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,032
Julie Chen, Maria Herrera,

310
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:04,168
Ryan Crosby--
The bench was pretty thin.

311
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:05,769
What was Will,
the weekend anchor?

312
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,272
- Legal correspondent.
- Shit.

313
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,940
Here it is.

314
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,442
What is it?
It's almost midnight.

315
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,378
He's been on the air
for 16 hours.

316
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:15,979
Probably hadn't had 10 words
with Charlie Skinner

317
00:14:16,014 --> 00:14:19,149
- in his life until this day.
- Is there sound?

318
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:20,918
That's coffee.

319
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:23,654
- I didn't know how you like it.
- I'm sure it's fine.

320
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:31,295
It can be lonely in here.

321
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:35,500
I've been learning
a little bit about you.

322
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:38,069
You're the oldest son?

323
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:39,637
Yeah.

324
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:43,374
You had to protect your sisters
and your brother and your mom

325
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:46,478
from a pretty violent father,
it sounds like.

326
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:51,149
Do it again.

327
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,651
<i>I've got faith in you.</i>

328
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:56,854
Why?

329
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:59,156
I'm out of options.

330
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,626
You're back in five, four...

331
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:17,440
He froze?

332
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:25,182
I've been searching
for biblical quotes.

333
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:27,118
None of them...

334
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:32,289
We don't know
how many are dead.

335
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,991
<i>It's gonna be a lot.</i>

336
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:36,059
<i>It's gonna be thousands.</i>

337
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:37,660
<i>We don't know who attacked us.</i>

338
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:40,763
We don't know
what's coming tomorrow.

339
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:43,566
And I don't know
what I'm doing.

340
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:47,336
But I'll make you this promise:

341
00:15:51,273 --> 00:15:53,308
I'm gonna be with you
all night.

342
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:54,909
I'm not going anywhere.

343
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:57,912
<i>I'll be right here.</i>

344
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:02,783
<i>John Chase is at the Pentagon.</i>

345
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:05,987
<i>Will, the smoke
is still billowing</i>

346
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:08,356
<i>out of the western side
of the Pentagon,</i>

347
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,591
<i>where at 9:37
this morning,</i>

348
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,226
<i>it was struck
by American Airlines...</i>

349
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,794
Finally, in the first
national poll

350
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:16,796
released after Rick Perry
officially announced...

351
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:19,632
- Come in.
- I think if I slip out now before the show's over--

352
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,434
Let me help you carry your stuff to a cab.

353
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:24,170
No, I'm good.

354
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:26,206
I appreciate you
not asking too many...

355
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,474
- What the hell happened?
- questions.

356
00:16:30,276 --> 00:16:33,212
I shouted at
a <i>Sex and the City</i> tour bus

357
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:35,581
that my roommate and I were
both into the same guy.

358
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:38,751
<i>Someone on the bus taped the whole thing
and posted it on YouTube.</i>

359
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:41,087
Someone Don knows
sent him a link.

360
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:43,289
- Shit.
- And Jim was on the bus.

361
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:45,357
Jim was on
a <i>Sex and the City</i> tour bus?

362
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:46,792
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Why?

363
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:48,427
I'm just lucky, I guess.

364
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:51,597
- How many views does it have?
- 1,118 as of a half hour ago.

365
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:53,899
- And Don's one of them?
- It's a Labor Day miracle.

366
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:56,802
- <i>Has Lisa seen it?</i>
- No.

367
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:59,905
I sent an e-mail trying to get it
taken down under their privacy policy,

368
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:01,673
but I got an auto-response
saying it takes five days.

369
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,777
<i>Then I tried getting it taken down
under their copyright policy--</i>

370
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:07,380
The <i>Sex and the City</i>
music and logo can be heard and seen.

371
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:09,215
- And?
- Five days.

372
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,417
I can't think
of anything else to try.

373
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:13,787
- What about--
- Foursquare!

374
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:16,357
- She's gonna be on Foursquare.
- It was a tour bus.

375
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:18,225
You really think
the poster lives in New York?

376
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,695
The video's called
"Another New Yorker Loses It."

377
00:17:20,729 --> 00:17:21,996
"<i>Another</i> New Yorker."

378
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,098
Somebody from Maryland
could say the same thing

379
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:26,567
- without the emphasis on the first word.
- Right here.

380
00:17:26,635 --> 00:17:28,869
Oh, she just posted
three minutes ago.

381
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:31,038
"My underwear
is on gentle cycle

382
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,841
while my love life
is being scraped against a rock."

383
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,909
And she's at a Laundromat
in Astoria.

384
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:38,679
If she just put clothes
in the gentle cycle three minutes ago,

385
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:41,515
she's got another 42 minutes,
plus 50 minutes in the dryer.

386
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:44,418
I can take the 7 to Queensboro Plaza,
transfer to the N.

387
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:45,887
I can make it.

388
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,822
- I'm coming with you.
- No, I'm good.

389
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:49,223
I'm not letting you go
to Queens to negotiate

390
00:17:49,257 --> 00:17:51,892
with Sylvia Plath by yourself.

391
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:54,328
Come on.

392
00:17:54,363 --> 00:17:55,663
Thanks.

393
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,799
- Ron Paul trails...
<i>- And just like that,</i>

394
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,301
- Perry's up 12 points over Romney.
- We can see.

395
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:02,837
And only two-thirds of Republican voters
know who Perry is,

396
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:05,773
which means that four in 10 who do know
who he is have him as their first choice.

397
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,108
We are looking at
the same thing you are.

398
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:08,609
Perry's gonna
come back to earth.

399
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:10,845
He's a legitimate conservative
with a ton of money.

400
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:12,513
Eventually,
he's gonna have to speak.

401
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,583
- Jim Harper.
- Stillman.

402
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,184
Not your phone.

403
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:20,653
<i>- Jim?</i>
- Yeah. Hi.

404
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:22,755
Hang on a second.

405
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,160
- Hey. How are you doing?
- I'm fine, thanks.

406
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:29,728
But I need to
tell you something.

407
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:34,699
There's a YouTube video of me
shouting at the bus.

408
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:36,568
I'm sorry,
it's kind of loud in here.

409
00:18:36,602 --> 00:18:39,871
- I can't really shout right now.
- Okay, hang on.

410
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:46,011
- Are you still there?
- Yeah, but I'm getting on the elevator now.

411
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:50,549
- What were you saying?
- There's a YouTube video of me shouting at the bus.

412
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,751
<i>The whole thing.</i>

413
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,355
<i>Are you there?</i>

414
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:57,390
Yeah.

415
00:18:57,425 --> 00:18:59,660
<i>You remember what I said,
right?</i>

416
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:01,395
- Yeah.
- I'm taking care of it.

417
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,965
I'm going to get it taken down.
I just wanted you to know.

418
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:05,333
Has Lisa seen it?

419
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,268
- <i>No.</i>
- Has Don?

420
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,838
- Ahem...
- Maggie?

421
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:12,140
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Has Don seen it?

422
00:19:12,174 --> 00:19:14,175
Yeah.

423
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:17,611
- Are you guys all right?
- I'm moving back in with Lisa.

424
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:19,446
- Shit.
<i>- I gotta go.</i>

425
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,316
- I should call Don.
- I wouldn't do that. I think it'd just--

426
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,117
And he's having a hard time
with Troy Davis, so--

427
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:25,752
He is a really good guy
and I screwed him--

428
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:28,088
- I've got it all covered, okay?
<i>- Maggie...</i>

429
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:30,557
I screwed him.
You were on a bus.

430
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:03,294
<i>Excuse me.</i>

431
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:06,197
Are you Erica?

432
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:07,966
- Yeah.
- Do you recognize me?

433
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,335
W-what are you doing?
What's going on?

434
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:12,938
No, it's okay.
You don't have to be scared.

435
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:15,441
- Why would you even say that?
- Sorry, that was stupid.

436
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:16,976
I'm Maggie Jordan.

437
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,644
I was the one
who screamed at the bus

438
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:20,213
like a lunatic that night.

439
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:22,681
That's my friend Sloan.

440
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:25,051
Okay, but I'm feeling
a little ambushed.

441
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:26,319
You're not.

442
00:20:26,353 --> 00:20:27,787
How did you find me?

443
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:29,689
We haven't been
following you or anything.

444
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:32,459
- Why would you say that?
- I found you on Foursquare.

445
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:34,728
- I'm not dangerous.
- Okay.

446
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:37,664
I just need to ask you a favor.

447
00:20:37,698 --> 00:20:39,900
I really need you to take down
your YouTube post.

448
00:20:39,934 --> 00:20:42,703
- It would mean a lot to me.
- This is crazy.

449
00:20:42,737 --> 00:20:45,106
- Yeah.
- I can't believe I'm talking to you.

450
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,808
- Well, like I said--
- I'm really curious.

451
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:48,743
- Did you and your best friend make up?
- I'm sorry?

452
00:20:48,778 --> 00:20:50,445
You said,
"I just spent my last $7

453
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,047
having a fight
with my best friend."

454
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:54,116
Yeah. We did.
We did make up.

455
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,718
And I said something
in the video

456
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:57,520
that would really hurt her
if she saw it.

457
00:20:57,554 --> 00:20:59,822
That you like her boyfriend.

458
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:04,026
- This is so weird.
- Yeah, it is.

459
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,795
It's like I'm in this now.

460
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,396
<i>Believe me,
you don't wanna be in it.</i>

461
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,698
<i>And was the guy
who jumped off the bus,</i>

462
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:10,099
was that the guy
you were talking about?

463
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,868
- It doesn't matter.
- Was it?

464
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,403
I'd rather not get
other people involved.

465
00:21:13,437 --> 00:21:15,471
You didn't know he was on the bus
when you shouted--

466
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:17,573
- No. No, I didn't.
- What happened when he ran after you?

467
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,409
It doesn't matter.
I just need the video taken down--

468
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:21,277
- Are you guys together now?
- She said it doesn't matter, Erica.

469
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:23,280
How far up her ass do you need to crawl
before you get--

470
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:24,548
It's all right.

471
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,317
That was really rude.

472
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,285
She works a long day.
We're all right.

473
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,720
'Cause I don't respond
to things like that.

474
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:32,590
Me neither.
I have a hunch we're a lot alike.

475
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,191
You don't even know me.

476
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,528
That's the thing, I feel like I do,
from reading your blog.

477
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,331
She writes this <i>Sex and the City</i>
fan fiction, except--

478
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,032
- It's not fan fiction!
- That's what I was about to say.

479
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,667
- It's not fan fiction.
- I take experiences from my life

480
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,803
and I write them
in the voice of the characters.

481
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,774
- Will you take down the video?
- This is the most views I've ever had,

482
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,611
- and it links to my blog.
- I'm asking as a personal favor.

483
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,380
- I don't know.
- How many Twitter followers do you have?

484
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,549
- I have over 300.
- I have more than that.

485
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,851
I'm gonna give you something to tweet,
and I'll retweet it,

486
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:02,886
and in exchange
you'll take down the video.

487
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,655
- How many do you have?
- More than 300.

488
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:06,190
How many?

489
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,192
450,000.

490
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:12,363
- You do not have 450,000.
- She does.

491
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,400
Are you famous?

492
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,435
She's very well-known and
respected in certain circles.

493
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,672
- What are you famous for?
- Making other people rich.

494
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:20,906
Tweet this--

495
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,041
"As China's reliance
on oil increases,

496
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:24,276
investors would be
well-tipped

497
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,480
to look toward Nigeria
for the next supply boom."

498
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,082
That doesn't
really do anything for my blog.

499
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:31,217
It's not--

500
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,721
Okay.

501
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,289

- "A real-life Carrie Bradshaw."
- Can I say Charlotte?

505
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:50,137
You know what?
You cannot say Charlotte.

506
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,905
- You can say Charlotte.
- I like Charlotte.

507
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,173
Seriously?

508
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:57,845
Say Charlotte.

509
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:08,689
- Cameron?
- Yeah?

510
00:23:08,724 --> 00:23:10,658
Any chance I can get 30 minutes
with the candidate today?

511
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:12,293
No.

512
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:17,566
Governor Romney continued
his campaign swing

513
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:20,469
through the Granite State with
a town hall-style event at the VFW Hall...

514
00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:22,572
For Atlantis Cable News,
I'm Jim Harper

515
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,407
with the Romney campaign
in Alexandria, New Hampshire.

516
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:25,942
...in Sutton, New Hampshire...

517
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:27,711
For Atlantis Cable News,
I'm Jim Harper

518
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:29,713
with the Romney campaign
in Gilbert.

519
00:23:29,748 --> 00:23:32,483
I was hoping you'd run a name
through your VA database for me.

520
00:23:32,517 --> 00:23:34,451
Gunnery Sergeant Eric Sweeney.

521
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:36,420
- Maggie.
- Yeah, it's a very common name.

522
00:23:36,454 --> 00:23:39,155
I'll take anyone who was deployed
in the last 10 years.

523
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,357
Satellite Sentinel Project
just released a report

524
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:43,125
that they have evidence
that the Sudanese government

525
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,361
is building mass civilian graves
in the Nuba Mountains.

526
00:23:45,395 --> 00:23:46,562
- Can I get the report?
- The whole thing?

527
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:47,796
The whole thing.

528
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:49,465
8:30 we start
with a business roundtable

529
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:50,967
where the governor will be
talking about

530
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:52,769
<i>how to fix Obama's
stalled economy.</i>

531
00:23:52,803 --> 00:23:55,971
<i>Then we go to Claremont
for an 11:00 AM Freedom Forum</i>

532
00:23:56,006 --> 00:23:58,807
<i>where he'll talk about Obama's
stalled economy and how to fix it.</i>

533
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:00,542
Lunch is turkey sandwiches.

534
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:02,544
And then at 3:00 PM
town hall meeting

535
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:05,113
where Governor Romney
will be taking questions from voters

536
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:07,081
about how he's gonna
fix the economy.

537
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,183
- And Jim has a question already.
- Yes.

538
00:24:09,218 --> 00:24:10,451
How's the governor
gonna fix the economy?

539
00:24:10,486 --> 00:24:12,186
<i>He will be talking
about that today.</i>

540
00:24:12,221 --> 00:24:14,522
- Any chance I can get 30 minutes?
- No. But keep asking.

541
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:15,856
I will.

542
00:24:27,985 --> 00:24:30,791
_

543
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,942
A Christian group armed with knives,
machetes, and guns

544
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:38,077
- attacked Muslims in Nigeria.
- Give me everything.

545
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:40,580
Lieutenant Riley,
my name is Jerry Dantana.

546
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:42,849
I'm with ACN,
and I'm trying to track down

547
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:44,985
a retired Marine
gunnery sergeant

548
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,153
named Eric Sweeney,
likely Special Ops.

549
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:48,622
Eric Sweeney?

550
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:50,590
They were armed with knives,
machetes, and bows

551
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,759
and attacked Muslims praying
during Ramadan.

552
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:55,929
- <i>21 people are dead.</i>
- Did any of them live here?

553
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,997
No.

554
00:24:58,032 --> 00:25:00,233
In an historic address
to a joint session of Congress,

555
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:03,802
the president implored lawmakers
to pass the American Jobs Act.

556
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,905
The president used the phrase,
"Pass this jobs bill"

557
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,641
18 times during his address.

558
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,910
Pass this jobs bill
and we can put people to work

559
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:13,845
<i>rebuilding America.</i>

560
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,414
<i>Everyone here knows
we have badly decaying</i>

561
00:25:16,449 --> 00:25:18,950
<i>roads and bridges
all over the country.</i>

562
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,119
<i>Our highways are clogged
with traffic,</i>

563
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,688
<i>our skies are the most
congested in the world...</i>

564
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,224
<i>Pass this jobs bill,</i>

565
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,560
and companies will get
extra tax credits

566
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:30,194
<i>if they hire American veterans.</i>

567
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,468
Jim Harper.

568
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,102
She says I need to be
more specific

569
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:39,737
and that it has to have
something to do with us.

570
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,406
- <i>Give me advice.</i>
- Be specific and have it have

571
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,576
- <i>something to do with us.</i>
- Okay.

572
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,882
So I should probably
get back to work.

573
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,317
- Jim?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

574
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:54,886
I just want things to be back to normal,
you know?

575
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,555
- I'm normal.
<i>- It doesn't sound like it.</i>

576
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,191
And I don't know what the hell
you're doing in New Hampshire

577
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,592
when you're a senior producer.

578
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,360
I'm waiting for Ben Furusho's
ankle to heal.

579
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,329
- You're lost.
- Hey, you know what? Look who's talking.

580
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:10,634
- All right.
- All right.

581
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:12,802
Well, have a good night.

582
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:14,671
<i>You too.</i>

583
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,846
She wants things to be normal?

584
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:25,981
Um...

585
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:30,085
yeah.

586
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,520
Why don't you?

587
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,689
I didn't like normal.

588
00:26:36,827 --> 00:26:38,694
She's someone in my newsroom.

589
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:41,998
- I didn't ask.
- Okay.

590
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,770
<i>- Three Es.
S-W-E-E-N-E-Y.</i>

591
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:49,039
I'll hold.

592
00:26:50,274 --> 00:26:52,375
You all right?

593
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:55,778
Yeah.

594
00:26:55,813 --> 00:26:57,814
Can you think
of anything about Africa

595
00:26:57,848 --> 00:26:59,782
that's relevant to Americans?

596
00:26:59,816 --> 00:27:02,985
It's the next place
US soldiers are gonna go to die.

597
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,921
Yeah, he was
a gunnery sergeant.

598
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:40,656
<i>They took down the Towers,
hit the Pentagon,</i>

the Capitol.

601
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,099
In the decade since,
the world's become a different place.

602
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,601
<i>Our country's become

<i>We've gone to war in Iraq

5,000 troops to our enemies.</i>

605

Whatcha got?

606
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,581
Netflix is gonna separate

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,817
the DVD-by-mail plan
from the online.

608
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:07,152
I saw it.
Bring it up again at 2:00.

609
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,754
Ron Paul won
the California straw poll

610
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,322
and got Barry Manilow's
endorsement.

611
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:14,327
I'm looking down at my papers
'cause there are things here that interest me,

612
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,162
and not so I don't laugh
at what Martin just said.

613
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,398
Um, speaking of laughing...

614
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:20,233
- Neal.
- Yeah.

615
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:22,803
Neal went to cover a protest
rally over the weekend.

616
00:28:22,837 --> 00:28:24,972
- "Flip 'n' Fry Wall Street"?
- Occupy.

617
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:26,440
20,000 protestors
were promised.

618
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:28,009
- Did they get 20,000?
- No.

619
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,577
- 15?
<i>- No.</i>

620
00:28:29,612 --> 00:28:32,680
How many people came
to "Fluff 'n' Fold Wall Street"?

621
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:35,783
Police estimate there were 300 people
in Zuccotti Park.

622
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:37,318
<i>Ooh!</i>

623
00:28:37,352 --> 00:28:39,186
You guys have to check out
the e-mail blast.

624
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:42,056
<i>- Please don't.</i>
- This is what got Neal's attention.

625
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:45,159
<i>Hello, Citizens of the Internet.</i>

626
00:28:45,193 --> 00:28:46,494
<i>We are Anonymous.</i>

627
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:48,061
- Seriously?
<i>- On September 17th,</i>

628
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:50,698
<i>Anonymous will flood
into lower Manhattan,</i>

629
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:53,534
<i>set up tents, kitchens,
peaceful barricades...</i>

630
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:55,135
Oh.
It's a Salvador Dali mask.

631
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,437
- <i>Guy Fawkes.</i>
- What's that?

632
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:59,374
The masks--
Guy Fawkes.

633
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:00,709
<i>one simple demand</i>

634
00:29:00,743 --> 00:29:02,944
<i>in a plurality of voices--
We want freedom.</i>

635
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:06,148
<i>Join us. We are Anonymous.</i>

636
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:09,384
<i>We are Legion.
Wall Street, expect us.</i>

637
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,219
This film is not yet rated.

638
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,391
They're cheering for you!

639
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:16,992
They're ironically
cheering for a video

640
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:18,527
that had me chase a nonstory.

641
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:20,496
- Well, next best thing.
- Good morning.

642
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,164
- Good morning!
- Don, listen to this.

643
00:29:22,198 --> 00:29:25,167
No, already you're
making it sound bad.

644
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:27,936
Don, listen to this.

645
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:30,805
I just saw a convincing
presentation

646
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,074
from the guys
at B.A. Strategies.

647
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:36,011
The subject--
Audience retention.

648
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:38,079
<i>Not in the sense
of retaining your lead-in,</i>

649
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:40,048
but actual retention.

650
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:42,017
<i>Holding on to
the information you got.</i>

651
00:29:42,051 --> 00:29:44,686
- Retention in the sense of--
- I'm begging you.

652
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,855
18% more viewers stay watching

653
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,190
past the first quarter
of a show

654
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:50,625
- if that show features...
- No.

655
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:53,795
- Yes.
- an engaged Twitter audience.

656
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:58,333
<i>You want me to do a whole show</i>

657
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,135
with a bunch of little messages
flashing underneath me?

658
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:02,403
<i>They wouldn't be flashing,
it'll be a scroll.</i>

659
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:03,805
You can't turn your arm clockwise

660
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,473
and turn your leg counterclockwise
at the same time.

661
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:06,975
Try. You can't do it.
Go ahead.

662
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:09,210
Well, obviously,
I'm not going to do that.

663
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:13,281
It encourages a highly engaged audience,
and that's an ad sales point.

664
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:15,316
They why not do it
on Will's show?

665
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:18,520
- Mac would never allow it.
- Don would never allow it if he were in the room.

666
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:20,922
- Charlie.
- Don's back.

667
00:30:20,956 --> 00:30:23,224
I've got an off-the-record
source and no second confirmation

668
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:25,427
that there's been outside lobbying
on the Georgia Parole Board.

669
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:28,896
- Real lobbyists or--
- Yeah, lobbyists. Professional lobbyists.

670
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:31,365
That's not illegal for the parole board,
just for the lobbyists.

671
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:32,800
- Which way?
- Against.

672
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,568
Three-two
against clemency.

673
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,070
Gwen's on the air
for another 23 minutes.

674
00:30:36,104 --> 00:30:37,471
I want to have her
break in right now.

675
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:39,139
- How good's the source?
- It's--

676
00:30:39,174 --> 00:30:40,974
<i>Are they saying
money changed hands?</i>

677
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,877
No, just they made phone calls.

678
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:44,979
The pope's made
phone calls for this.

679
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:47,248
- Well, my swing vote--
- The guy you <i>think</i> is the swing vote.

680
00:30:47,282 --> 00:30:49,183
<i>Know</i> is the swing vote,

681
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:51,151
didn't listen to the pope,
he listened to lobbyists.

682
00:30:51,186 --> 00:30:53,420
So I'd like to go over to dayside
and have them report

683
00:30:53,455 --> 00:30:55,723
- <i>that there's been a development in the story.</i>
<i>- No way.</i>

684
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:58,559
Get someone on the record,
get confirmation, and we'll--

685
00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:00,128
We'll keep trying,
but in the meantime,

686
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:01,629
- I want to break in.
- Go with the story that--

687
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:03,498
You don't have the story
to break in with.

688
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:05,166
- The clock is ticking.
- Same rule.

689
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,002
Call him. Say you've heard a report
and you want confirmation.

690
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:10,505
When he denies it,
then I really won't be able to run it.

691
00:31:10,606 --> 00:31:12,140
You can't run it now.

692
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:14,175
Why don't I just
call him and tell him--

693
00:31:14,209 --> 00:31:16,110
I can just call him.

694
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:17,811
<i>I could call him and say,
"I know your name.</i>

695
00:31:17,846 --> 00:31:20,247
I know your name,
and if Troy Davis dies,

696
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:21,782
I'm reporting that you were
the swing vote.

697
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:24,184
I'm reporting your name,
your address,

698
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:26,587
and I'm gonna throw
a Google Earth image of your house

699
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:28,255
up on the screen
so we have a record

700
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,557
of what it looked like
before it was set on fire."

701
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:36,696
You could put a picture
of his kids up on the screen,

702
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,665
say where they go to school.

703
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:47,139
Seven of nine witnesses,
and one of the two is a suspect.

704
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:51,477
What could the lobbyist
have said to the parole board member

705
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:54,814
that could possibly have been better than
what the <i>pope</i> said?

706
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:00,953
Do you have anyone
inside the police unions?

707
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,889
<i>Nobody who'll tell me this.</i>

708
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,991
Then you'll just have to wait
for the Supreme Court.

709
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,826
Yeah.

710
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:08,895
Okay.

711
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,364
Don...

712
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:14,200
I've never really talked to you
about the YouTube,

713
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:15,734
the whole, you know...

714
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:17,002
No. Yeah, man.

715
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:19,604
Uh, I appreciate it.
Just...

716
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:21,072
just not this minute, okay?

717
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,441
Yeah. No. Cool.

718
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,510
All right?

719
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,645
All right.

720
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,915
You know something
about Troy Davis?

721
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,886
How did you hear that?

722
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,593
We're competitors.

723
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,568
- Hey.
- Hmm?

724
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,704
Nothing, I was...

725
00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:58,374
I heard something was going on
with the parole board.

726
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:01,410
I have a source saying
the swing vote was lobbied,

727
00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:03,712
- and it's 3-2 against.
- It's against the law for lobbyists--

728
00:33:03,746 --> 00:33:05,881
I know it is.

729
00:33:06,949 --> 00:33:08,216
It's not like I'm indifferent.

730
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,651
It never occurred
to me that you were.

731
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:12,820
- All right.
- I can give you cover.

732
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:15,123
If you're worried about coming out
for a guy accused--

733
00:33:15,157 --> 00:33:17,224
I don't need cover.

734
00:33:20,362 --> 00:33:22,563
One of the witnesses
said Davis confessed to him in jail.

735
00:33:22,597 --> 00:33:24,799
- Kevin McQueen.
- Then McQueen said he made it all up.

736
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,601
The court said the recantation
didn't mean much

737
00:33:26,635 --> 00:33:28,136
because McQueen
was so obviously lying

738
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,771
that the jurors
couldn't have attached much weight

739
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:31,440
to his testimony
in the first place.

740
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:33,642
It was clear that he was lying,
so it didn't matter that he was lying?

741
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:34,909
That was the ruling
of the US Court

742
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:36,611
for the Southern District
of Georgia, yeah.

743
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:38,112
The recanting witness
who said he was coerced?

744
00:33:38,147 --> 00:33:39,681
Jeffrey Sapp.
The court said his testimony

745
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:41,315
wasn't damaging
enough to Davis,

746
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,817
that if he'd really
been coerced, his--

747
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:44,352
Testimony would have
been more damaging.

748
00:33:44,386 --> 00:33:46,387
Another recanting witness said
she saw the alternate suspect

749
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:48,022
- pull the trigger.
- Harriet Murray.

750
00:33:48,057 --> 00:33:49,357
Why didn't she testify
at the hearing?

751
00:33:49,391 --> 00:33:51,492
She's dead.

752
00:33:51,527 --> 00:33:53,161
The court won't give
any weight to her claim.

753
00:33:53,195 --> 00:33:54,529
That's 'cause she wasn't
cross-examined.

754
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:56,131
- When did the burden shift?
- When he was convicted.

755
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:57,933
- He shot a police officer.
- No, he didn't.

756
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,735
The jury said he did.
The district court said he did.

757
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:01,470
I can only report what I know.

758
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:03,406
I'm not allowed
to get involved in advocacy,

759
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,907
and neither are you.

760
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,943
And from what I hear,
I'm sure you were just joking

761
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,713
about threatening
the swing vote with exposure.

762
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,582
I'm sure I was.

763
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,367
- Hey.
- How you doin'?

764
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:03,768
Good.
How was your day?

765
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:05,837
It was good.
You want a hug?

766
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,405
What?

767
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,241
You want me to give you a hug?

768
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,677
What's going on?

769
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:13,579
Come here.

770
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:19,886
You're so full of shit, Maggie.

771
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:23,189
What?

772
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,598
No, you didn't!

773
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:33,867
I'm the typical
single woman in New York...

774
00:35:33,902 --> 00:35:36,302
I got it taken down.
It was taken down.

775
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:37,804
I went to a
Laundromat in Queens

776
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:39,372
to make sure you
didn't have to see it--

777
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:41,273
Erica blogged all about
her brush with celebrity.

778
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,676
She didn't think Sloan was very nice,
so she reposted it.

779
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,244
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- You think it's adorable

780
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:47,012
that you're victimized
by your own life, don't you?

781
00:35:47,047 --> 00:35:48,781
<i>Like you're
Holly Go-Fuckin'-Lightly.</i>

782
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,449
- Okay...
- Don't misunderstand, I was moved

783
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:51,817
that your first instinct
was to impress upon me

784
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:53,051
how hard you tried to lie.

785
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:54,720
<i>But Maggie just can't
get the breaks.</i>

786
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:56,522
- That wasn't what--
- A minute ago, I was kind of furious.

787
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:58,290
But now that I know you went
all the way to Queens

788
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:01,160
to try to lie to me, well,
I just can't stay mad at you.

789
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:02,861
- Please let me speak.
- Right here.

790
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:05,497
...where you fall for a guy
and he's going out with your best friend!

791
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:09,635
It doesn't work out!
Things get really bad!

792
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,072
Get really bad for who?

793
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:15,408
<i>Who do things get bad for?</i>

794
00:36:15,443 --> 00:36:17,477
You were talking
about you, right?

795
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,146
Fuck Don, fuck Lisa.

796
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,916
<i>We hear Jim's voice,
and then he jumps off the bus and chases you.</i>

797
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,017
- <i>What happened next?</i>
- It doesn't matter.

798
00:36:23,051 --> 00:36:24,852
- The whole thing--
- It matters to me.

799
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:27,489
- The whole thing--
- What happened next?

800
00:36:27,523 --> 00:36:29,624
He came after me and we talked.

801
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,860
What else did you do?

802
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:35,097
"Don't you dare lie to me,
Big Mike."

803
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,935
- We kissed.
- Yeah.

804
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:41,070
And then I went back to Don,
and Jim went back to you.

805
00:36:41,104 --> 00:36:42,438
And the last few weeks,
when I'd say

806
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:43,673
Jim sounded weird on the phone,

807
00:36:43,707 --> 00:36:44,774
you said it was
"all in my head"

808
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:46,042
and I should
"stop acting crazy."

809
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:48,845
- I was wrong.
- Let's not rush to judgment.

810
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,815
Why did Jim
go to New Hampshire?

811
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:54,251
To cover for an embed who broke his ankle.
That's legitimate.

812
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:57,021
Is it common for someone with Jim's job
to take that assignment?

813
00:36:57,055 --> 00:36:58,656
No.

814
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,793
He left 'cause he didn't want to be
around Don and me.

815
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,196
- Last question.
- Lise...

816
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,999
- Why did you fix me up with Jim?
- I didn't. Don did.

817
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:09,134
And in fairness,
I'd been telling you about my feelings--

818
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:11,203
"In fairness"? In fairness,
you then turned into eHarmony

819
00:37:11,237 --> 00:37:13,305
<i>and told me over and over
that you didn't have feelings.</i>

820
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:14,973
- Yeah.
- I mean, after all the breaking up

821
00:37:15,008 --> 00:37:17,543
and getting back together,
and you're telling me over a year of this,

822
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:19,578
you didn't want him
to pick you,

823
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,647
you wanted him to pick you
instead of me.

824
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:24,916
- Hold it right there.
- Right?

825
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,619
- A little?
- You can't possibly think that.

826
00:37:27,653 --> 00:37:29,320
No, I can.
You're seeing me do it right now.

827
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:30,822
Okay, can we back up?
Because one of us

828
00:37:30,856 --> 00:37:32,223
is gonna say something
we can't walk back.

829
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:34,392
I think it's gonna be me.
What do you think?

830
00:37:34,426 --> 00:37:36,061
- I did one thing wrong.
- Hmm?

831
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:37,429
I did one thing wrong.

832
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,331
I told you I didn't have feelings
for Jim when I did.

833
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:41,166
You parked Jim with me
until you and Don were done for good,

834
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:42,568
which you knew was inevitable.

835
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:44,169
You parked him with me
because you thought that was safe.

836
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:47,306
- No...
- That Jim would never get serious with someone like me.

837
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:49,609
I don't know what
"someone like you" means.

838
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,511
- I don't meet a lot of guys' parents.
- That's because of the guys.

839
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:53,480
I'm used to being
humiliated by guys.

840
00:37:53,514 --> 00:37:55,749
I'm not used to being humiliated
by my best friend.

841
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:58,352
- I didn't set out to do that!
- But it was a pretty good perk!

842
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:01,822
Neither one of us
can afford to live alone.

843
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:03,724
I'm your landlord.
You're my tenant--

844
00:38:03,758 --> 00:38:05,326
- that's our relationship.
- Lisa...

845
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,427
There's nothing more to say.
I'm just going to e-mail the link to Jim,

846
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:10,731
save myself a phone call.

847
00:38:33,722 --> 00:38:35,422
But I just spent my last $7

848
00:38:35,457 --> 00:38:37,257
<i>having a fight
with my best friend,</i>

849
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,393
<i>who, by the way,
isn't available</i>

850
00:38:39,427 --> 00:38:40,861
<i>at 3:00 PM
on a Wednesday</i>

851
00:38:40,962 --> 00:38:44,832
<i>to console me about some guy
because she, too, has a job!</i>

852
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:06,186
Does anyone know
who Anwar Al-Awlaki is?

853
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:09,055
He became a radical imam
and organized violence against the US.

854
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,690
<i>- Where is he from?</i>
<i>- That's the thing.</i>

855
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:11,858
- What?
- He's American.

856
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:13,359
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

857
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:14,627
He's a US citizen.

858
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:16,996
Another American,
Samir Khan, was also killed,

859
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,831
but it was collateral.
He wasn't targeted.

860
00:39:18,865 --> 00:39:20,933
Wait, wait.
Al-Awlaki was targ--

861
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,568
His father was
a Fulbright Scholar

862
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:24,469
and got a PhD
at your alma mater.

863
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:27,005
Anwar studied engineering
at Colorado State

864
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,774
and education
at San Diego State.

865
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:32,343
An American
was on the kill list?

866
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,889
<i>Are you on the sidewalk?</i>

867
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:44,424
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm right over here.</i>

868
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,560
Wait, I think I see you.
Wave your arms.

869
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:49,296
All right, stay right there.

870
00:39:50,665 --> 00:39:52,065
You made it.

871
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,636
You said there was a rumor
that Radiohead was gonna be here.

872
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:58,271
Is Radiohead here
and those are their roadies?

873
00:39:58,306 --> 00:40:00,974
- That was a legitimate rumor.
- What the hell is a legitimate rumor?

874
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:03,677
- Now that I've got you here...
- You know how much shit I'm taking at work?

875
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:05,212
Congratulations
on having a job.

876
00:40:05,246 --> 00:40:06,613
There's nothing
I can do for you.

877
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:09,215
I run <i>News Night</i>'s website.
That's it.

878
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,718
And if there's anyone who wants this
to be a story, it's me,

879
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:14,454
but this is just
a dwindling local protest

880
00:40:14,488 --> 00:40:16,923
with a rambling list
of unfocused demands

881
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:20,259
that is more rambling and less focused
than when I met you four weeks ago.

882
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:22,595
- Something's going on up there.
<i>- Yeah, something's going on.</i>

883
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,697
<i>All day, all week,</i>

884
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:26,632
<i>occupying Wall Street.</i>

885
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:28,534
All day, all week...

886
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:32,104
Hang on. Mac?

887
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,106
We publically demand
the administration

888
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,841
release the memorandum
authorizing the killing.

889
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:37,108
By we, you mean me.

890
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,411
He's got Fifth and Sixth
Amendment protection.

891
00:40:39,445 --> 00:40:42,080
Look, I'm trying real hard to care
that Al-Awlaki is dead--

892
00:40:42,115 --> 00:40:44,249
I don't care that he's dead.
I care that we killed him.

893
00:40:44,283 --> 00:40:47,085
Without a trial or anything
resembling due process.

894
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,287
You can't switch teams,
declare your intention

895
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:51,256
to kill as many Americans
as possible

896
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,124
and not expect to be treated
as an enemy of the state.

897
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:55,827
And you can't be found to be an enemy
of the state without a trial.

898
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:59,430
John Dillinger said the problem
with living outside the law

899
00:40:59,465 --> 00:41:01,232
is that you no longer
have the protection of it.

900
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:02,666
That doesn't sound
like Dillinger.

901
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:04,202
Yeah, it may have been
someone else.

902
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:05,770
Federal agents
tried to arrest Dillinger

903
00:41:05,804 --> 00:41:07,137
coming out of a movie theater.

904
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,639
And when he pulled a gun,
they shot him.

905
00:41:08,673 --> 00:41:10,741
They didn't hit the theater
with a rocket.

906
00:41:10,775 --> 00:41:13,210
Al-Awlaki was the head of AQAP.
He doesn't get read Miranda.

907
00:41:13,244 --> 00:41:15,346
- I don't give a shit what his passport says.
- You don't?

908
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,282
And you know all those times the two of you
ask me why I'm a Republican

909
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:20,284
as if that's something
that needs an explanation?

910
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,587
- I don't know what the hell you're on about.
- I never heard either of you

911
00:41:22,621 --> 00:41:25,423
ask anyone why they're a Democrat.
Well, it's right here.

912
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,926
The purposeful suspension
of common sense.

913
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:30,563
Treason is a crime.
You have to be found guilty of it before--

914
00:41:30,597 --> 00:41:32,765
The White House Counsel.
The DOJ.

915
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,234
There is a legal analysis.
There's a memorandum

916
00:41:35,302 --> 00:41:36,836
that allows the president
to do this.

917
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,771
Great.
Can we see it?

918
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:41,507
Does it have a name
or is that secret, too?

919
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,009
What's our role here, guys?

920
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,744
Demand the memorandum
be made public.

921
00:41:44,778 --> 00:41:46,512
You think it's gonna
make our lives easier

922
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,482
if I appear to be defending a leader
of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula?

923
00:41:49,516 --> 00:41:51,751
Who cares about
our lives being easier?

924
00:41:51,785 --> 00:41:53,719
I do!
And you do, too,

925
00:41:53,754 --> 00:41:56,422
or there wouldn't be tweets
scrolling through Elliot's show tonight.

926
00:41:56,456 --> 00:42:00,126
Listen to me.
When I took you off the anniversary coverage,

927
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,894
I wasn't telling you
to change your clothes.

928
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:05,631
It was about that particular day
and this particular moment.

929
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:08,100
- They didn't know.
- What?

930
00:42:08,135 --> 00:42:10,636
We told the staff
he took himself off the anniversary.

931
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,838
Did anybody believe you?

932
00:42:12,872 --> 00:42:14,006
Everybody.

933
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,841
- No.
- Nobody.

934
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:18,177
- Excuse me.
<i>- Give us just a second.</i>

935
00:42:18,211 --> 00:42:20,646
Neal was arrested.
He's calling from the First Precinct.

936
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:25,217
- Put him on speaker, Maggie.
- You're on speaker.

937
00:42:25,285 --> 00:42:26,953
What happened, Neal?

938
00:42:26,987 --> 00:42:29,521
<i>I went to an Occupy rally.
I did it on my lunch hour.</i>

939
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,857
<i>The police started arresting
people who were wearing masks.</i>

940
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:35,294
<i>There's a law in the books in New York
that dates back to 1845.</i>

941
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:37,330
<i>Groups of people
can't wear masks in public.</i>

942
00:42:37,364 --> 00:42:38,898
- Were you wearing a mask?
<i>- No.</i>

943
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,633
Did you identify yourself
as a reporter?

944
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:42,368
<i>I did and I got
some good footage</i>

945
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:44,637
<i>until the officer confiscated
and destroyed my phone.</i>

946
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:46,906
- Are you kidding me?
- He still got the footage.

947
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,942
- How?
<i>- Maggie, open up Ustream.</i>

948
00:42:48,976 --> 00:42:51,378
Shout out your name
if you're getting arrested.

949
00:42:51,412 --> 00:42:54,080
<i>I picked up local Wi-Fi
to stream the video back to my computer.</i>

950
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,049
- <i>Do you see it?</i>
- We're watching it.

951
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:59,653
- Everybody get back and clear the sidewalk right now.
- No, stop!

952
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:01,288
Good job, man.

953
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:03,323
- I'm gonna come bail you out.
- I'm doing it.

954
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:05,659
- No.
- Send the film to my phone.

955
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:16,871
- Can I help you?
- You've got a dis con here named Neal Sampat.

956
00:43:16,939 --> 00:43:18,840
I need you to void the arrest.

957
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:21,276
- You his lawyer?
- Yes.

958
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,444
- I'm sorry, but aren't you--
- Yes.

959
00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:25,981
- Mr. Sampat works for me.
- Okay, well, Mr.--

960
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:28,450
It's gonna end in an ROR
or an ACD anyway, so...

961
00:43:28,484 --> 00:43:30,318
As I understand it,
he was creating a hazardous

962
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:33,121
or physically offensive condition
by an act which serves no purpose.

963
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:35,223
You're quoting 240-2-7,

964
00:43:35,257 --> 00:43:36,692
and it's
"no legitimate purpose."

965
00:43:36,726 --> 00:43:39,594
He was reporting on a protest.
That's a legitimate purpose.

966
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:41,229
- Here's how this works.
- I know how it works.

967
00:43:41,297 --> 00:43:43,698
Do you know the arresting officer?
Is he a friend of yours?

968
00:43:43,732 --> 00:43:46,667
- He is.
- Has he ever been the subject of a 1983 action?

969
00:43:46,702 --> 00:43:48,769
If you're not sure,
then he hasn't,

970
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:50,904
because it's a charge
for civil rights violations

971
00:43:50,939 --> 00:43:52,406
that never doesn't end
with badges

972
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,575
and service revolvers
being tossed on desks.

973
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:56,477
I'm sure it was
a by-the-book arrest.

974
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:58,579
Anwar Al-Awlaki
was killed today.

975
00:43:58,613 --> 00:44:01,181
It wasn't an accident.
There was no warrant, no arrest,

976
00:44:01,215 --> 00:44:04,184
no arraignment, no judge,
no jury, and no appeal.

977
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,487
- How do you spell--
- Not here.

978
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:09,823
A US citizen was targeted.

979
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:13,260
Another's on death row for the crime of
not being able to afford a good lawyer.

980
00:44:13,294 --> 00:44:17,231
And a bunch more have been
locked up for wearing Halloween masks.

981
00:44:17,265 --> 00:44:21,535
So obviously what I'm doing
is dealing with the easiest one.

982
00:44:25,774 --> 00:44:29,343
Sir, are you feeling all right?

983
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:38,653
Yeah, I--

984
00:44:38,687 --> 00:44:41,221
I just had the flu for a while.

985
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:45,392
<i>Everybody get back
and clear the sidewalk right now.</i>

986
00:44:45,426 --> 00:44:47,494
<i>Officer,
I'm Neal Sampat with ACN.</i>

987
00:44:47,528 --> 00:44:49,763
<i>Why are these people being arrested?
The street isn't really blocked.</i>

988
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:51,598
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get the hell out of here.

989
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,734
<i>This is a public sidewalk
and I'm reporting for ACN.</i>

990
00:44:53,768 --> 00:44:55,235
You want to fuck around, huh?

991
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,871
Which one of those two guys
would you rather be right now?

992
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,177
Void the arrest
on Mr. Sampat.

993
00:45:09,419 --> 00:45:12,755
I've got it--
The reason to cover Africa.

994
00:45:12,789 --> 00:45:14,623
National security.

995
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:16,859
Want to try not to shout
the words "national security"?

996
00:45:16,893 --> 00:45:18,961
Jerry said Africa
is the next place

997
00:45:18,995 --> 00:45:21,130
American soldiers are gonna
go to die and he's right.

998
00:45:21,164 --> 00:45:23,098
Do you ever think Will
might just be a douchebag?

999
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:26,501
- Oh, boy.
- And a little bit of a coward?

1000
00:45:26,536 --> 00:45:27,836
I don't know.

1001
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,305
There's a whole continent
of news about to happen.

1002
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:31,973
There are 54 countries
on that continent.

1003
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:34,642
- I need you to be specific.
- I'm about to be specific.

1004
00:45:34,677 --> 00:45:36,544
The war on terror
is shifting to Africa.

1005
00:45:36,578 --> 00:45:38,646
Can you tell me three differences
between a Sunni and a Shi'a?

1006
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,482
I can tell you more than three differences.
I was shot at by both of them.

1007
00:45:41,516 --> 00:45:43,818
- And could you before 9/11?
- No.

1008
00:45:43,852 --> 00:45:45,553
- Could anybody?
- No.

1009
00:45:45,587 --> 00:45:47,655
And was that good for us?

1010
00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:49,657
What is it with you and Africa?

1011
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,862
I want to be the go-to person
on something around here.

1012
00:45:54,896 --> 00:45:56,597
You've got Martin on politics,

1013
00:45:56,631 --> 00:45:58,766
Tess and Tamara on the Hill,
Sloan on economics,

1014
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,768
Kendra can book anyone
in 10 minutes.

1015
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:03,504
If you had to start
a news team with five people,

1016
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:05,439
I wouldn't be one of them.

1017
00:46:05,473 --> 00:46:07,107
Gary and I want
to go to Kampala

1018
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:09,509
and interview the officer in charge
of the Joint Task Force

1019
00:46:09,544 --> 00:46:11,278
and get a full tour
of Camp Kasenyi,

1020
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:13,814
<i>then come home and interview
the right counterterrorism experts.</i>

1021
00:46:13,848 --> 00:46:15,115
You'd need to get
the permission--

1022
00:46:15,149 --> 00:46:16,683
I already have clearance
from the DOJ,

1023
00:46:16,718 --> 00:46:19,353
the Pentagon
and both embassies.

1024
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:21,488
You're green
and it's dangerous.

1025
00:46:21,523 --> 00:46:23,924
I've been seeing wire reports
for weeks about fighting--

1026
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:26,260
In the Sudan,
nowhere near where we're going.

1027
00:46:26,294 --> 00:46:28,562
And I'm not green
and neither is Gary.

1028
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:34,234
- Who's the president of Uganda?
- Yoweri Museveni.

1029
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:36,069
- Who's the US ambassador?
- Jerry Lanier.

1030
00:46:36,103 --> 00:46:37,704
- What's the currency?
- The shilling.

1031
00:46:37,738 --> 00:46:39,539
- Local customs?
- The main religion is Christianity.

1032
00:46:39,573 --> 00:46:42,742
Women dress conservatively
and their independence day is October 9.

1033
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:45,245
We'll get yellow fever vaccinations
and malaria pills.

1034
00:46:45,279 --> 00:46:46,880
When you're kidnapped,
your government--

1035
00:46:46,914 --> 00:46:48,515
My government
won't acknowledge it

1036
00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:50,984
and my company won't set
precedent by paying ransom.

1037
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,088
This is not a dangerous area.

1038
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:02,162
Book your travel.

1039
00:47:02,196 --> 00:47:04,330
Yes!

1040
00:47:16,443 --> 00:47:18,444
We're going.

1041
00:47:18,478 --> 00:47:20,880
We just got a wire report.

1042
00:47:20,915 --> 00:47:22,649
Did you hear what I said?

1043
00:47:22,683 --> 00:47:25,852
Five dead and 150 injured
in a protest.

1044
00:47:25,887 --> 00:47:27,654
How close to Kampala?

1045
00:47:27,689 --> 00:47:29,990
In Kampala.

1046
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,628
Are you still up for this?

1047
00:47:33,662 --> 00:47:35,430
Yeah.

1048
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:39,300
Then don't show this to Mac.

1049
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:41,235
We're going.

1050
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:54,916
Prison really changes a man.

1051
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:57,051
You get a lot of thinking done.

1052
00:47:58,354 --> 00:48:00,321
- How long were you in there?
- About an hour.

1053
00:48:00,356 --> 00:48:01,689
Hour and 15 minutes.

1054
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:05,460
It's slow time.

1055
00:48:05,528 --> 00:48:07,262
To Neal.

1056
00:48:07,296 --> 00:48:09,964
Cheers.

1057
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:27,245
- Use your words.
- Isn't it enough that they love you?

1058
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,681
- They'd walk into fire for you.

<i>roughly 10 minutes ago

1097
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,875
The Supreme Court
in private reviews

1098
00:50:34,909 --> 00:50:36,476
denied Mr. Davis's
request for a stay.

1099
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:39,846
<i>The family of slain police officer
Mark MacPhail was present,</i>

1100
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:42,783
<i>and, with his last words,
Mr. Davis maintained his innocence.</i>

1101
00:50:42,817 --> 00:50:45,385
Mr. Davis
was 42 years old.

1102

<i>Troy Davis was convicted
