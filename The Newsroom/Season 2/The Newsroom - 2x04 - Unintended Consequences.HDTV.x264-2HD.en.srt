You can't possibly
believe this story.

2
00:00:02,226 --> 00:00:03,793
At what point do we
have to take it seriously?

3
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:05,395
We'll never find that out.

4

<i>Find me an informed
representative of the pajama party</i>

5

five minutes

00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:14,037
of national prime time
air with Will McAvoy.

7
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:16,829
- Hallie, ask the question.
- Don't let Jim egg you on.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,852
Don't change the fucking subject.
Which is it?

9
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:23,757
We can force them to answer our questions
if we do it together.

10
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,693
Who's with me?

11
00:00:28,063 --> 00:00:31,029
You and Gary are going to
an orphanage in north Uganda

12
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,198
that shelters kids whose parents
have been killed in the wars.

13
00:00:33,232 --> 00:00:35,300
- I'm going.
- You're going.

14
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,169
- What's Willie Pete?
- It's white phosphorus.

15
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:40,938
Hamni8. Americans.
White smoke.

16
00:00:40,972 --> 00:00:42,872
Hamni8. Burning.

17
00:00:42,907 --> 00:00:44,805
He's describing Genoa.

- Do you like the East Side?
- Yeah.

47
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:05,103
I don't know.
I always thought the best thing about it

48
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:06,638
was you got to look
at the West Side.

49
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm on the third floor.

50
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:10,375
My window faces another window.

51
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,377
I just got shown
a place on 5th Avenue.

52
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:14,679
High floor, wraparound terrace.

53
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:16,148
It was listed at 17 million,

54
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:17,549
but the broker thinks
it's gonna go

55
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,584
as low as 14.5.
They're very motivated.

with General
Stanislaus Stomtonovich.

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,595
- Am I pronouncing the name correctly?
- Yes.

61
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,198
- Those Dutch don't make it easy, do they?
- It's Polish.

62
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:33,766
I know, but I just have
a thing about the Dutch.

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,869
The interview was
conducted at his home

64
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,104
- in Silver Spring, Maryland?
- Yes.

65
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,441
Every four years, we give these guys
a gold medal in flukentot

66
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:43,676
when they grew up having
to flukentot to school.

67
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:45,011
- Who?
- The Dutch.

68
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:46,846
- I'm Dutch.
- Well, then fuck you.

69
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,452
Look, it's not like I don't know
what this is gonna be about

70
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:53,921
and I also understand
the strategy

71
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:55,757
of trying to rattle someone
before an interview.

72
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,291
That's not what I'm doing.

73
00:03:57,326 --> 00:03:59,126
I'm trying to see
if you laugh anymore.

74
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:03,264
I make these guys laugh
all the time.

75
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:04,966
Don't I?

76
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:07,702
I crack these guys up.

77
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:10,372
I am known as a funny lawyer.
You should check me out.

78
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:11,941
I have checked you out,
Rebecca,

79
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:13,776
and you don't handle
wrongful termination suits.

80
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,711
- You're a First Amendment lawyer.
- I am.

81
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,879
And I haven't read the other ones yet,
but they're on the list.

82
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,848
Well, I'd like to
once and for all

83
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:22,484
abudiate the notion
that I am messed up.

84
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:24,686
- Once and for all.
- I understand.

85
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,955
- Thank you.
- But I'm gonna challenge you on abudiate.

86
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,425
- Yeah, there's no such word.
- Then why'd you use it?

87
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,761
Because I am funny, too.

88
00:04:31,795 --> 00:04:35,999
We are going to expel
or dismiss or expunge

89
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,035
the notion that I am damaged.

90
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,238
I'm hardly the only person in my newsroom
who's ever seen a dead guy.

91
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:43,208
And that part of this case
would be hanging on my--

92
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,545
- I don't know what to call it.
- State of mind.

93
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:49,485
Seriously, that part of this case
would be hanging on my state of mind

94
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,655
six months later, by the way,
when we interviewed Stomtonovich...

95
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,590
- Dutch son of a bitch.
- ...is insane.

96
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:56,392
- I'm not kidding.
<i>- I know.</i>

97
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:57,860
I'm here to help you abudiate.

98
00:04:57,895 --> 00:04:59,929
- That's what we're doing this morning.
- Okay.

99
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:02,065
So you're gonna
have to tell me about Africa.

100
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:03,967
The fact that you're even asking
implies that it's relevant.

101
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:07,271
The fact that it's in Jerry Dantana's affidavit
implies it is relevant.

102
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:11,008
He says that you were on prescription medications
when you came back from Africa,

103
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:12,944
probably a series of SSRis,

104
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:15,013
- serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
- I wasn't.

105
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:16,948
And that you're in no position

106
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:19,884
- to say whether Stomtonovich said...
- It happened.

107
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,552
- ...it happened.
- He didn't say it.

108
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:24,588
What I would do if I were them
is I would put you in front of a jury

109
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:26,590
and I would make you
tell the Africa story

110
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,093
and I would be good and sure
that you broke down while you were telling it.

111
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,661
They're free to try.

112
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:33,296
Well, I'd like to get a first look at
how it's gonna go.

113
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,066
Gary Cooper and I
flew to Uganda.

114
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,568
Is his name really Gary Cooper?

115
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:40,804
Yes.

116
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,574
Oh, I laugh
every time I read that.

117
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:46,710
I can't wait to meet him.

118
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:48,412
Why did you fly to Uganda?

119
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:50,981
I pitched a story about
the hundred US combat troops

120
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:52,816
that were sent to hunt
for Joseph Kony,

121
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,651
<i>who's the leader of
the Lord's Resistance Army.</i>

122
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:56,453
In exchange for access
to Camp Kasenyi,

123
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:58,755
which is our forward
operating base out of Kampala,

124
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:01,925
the Pentagon's Public Affairs people
wanted us to shoot some film

125
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,160
of soldiers building
an addition onto an orphanage.

126
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:06,296
That's a sad project
when you think about it.

127
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,297
Yeah, I could fall apart
any second.

128
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:10,599
I wasn't baiting you.

129
00:06:10,634 --> 00:06:13,102
When did you and Gary leave?

130
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:15,304
A year ago September.
The night of September 30.

131
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:17,373
How do you get to Uganda?

132
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:18,708
Practice.

133
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:22,011
You fly to Dubai
and get a connecting flight to Entebbe.

134
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:24,581
We left straight
from the newsroom right before--

135
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:29,419
Right before-- God,

136
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,688
right before Will

137
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:35,225
just murderlized
this woman from OWS.

138
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:37,193
Gary and I watched it
in the cab.

139
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:39,963
The new Fox News poll has the former
Massachusetts governor

140
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:42,465
back in the lead
with 23% of Republicans,

141
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,901
<i>followed by Rick Perry with 19%</i>

142
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:46,670
<i>and 17% for Herman Cain,</i>

143
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:50,807
<i>reflecting a big boost
for the former Godfather's Pizza CEO.</i>

144
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:54,077
On the other side of the break,
I'll have one of the early organizers

145
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:55,545
of the Occupy Wall Street
movement.

146
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,414
- <i>We'll be right back.</i>
<i>- Three minutes back.</i>

147
00:06:57,448 --> 00:07:00,117
- We're leaving.
- Souvenirs, let's go. Shout them out.

148
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:01,719
I would like any traditional
tribal weapon--

149
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,921
Short spears, hooks,
sticks, bows.

150
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:06,223
They're not gonna let them pass security
with short spears.

151
00:07:06,258 --> 00:07:08,492
And I'll have an intern
get you local sticks.

152
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:10,194
- Who's next?
- A silk kaznu.

153
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:12,462
- That's a colorful wrap dress.
- Yeah.

154
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:13,963
Got about
two and a half minutes.

155
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,166
I got a lot of friends
who think this is a bad idea.

156
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,801
- How many?
- I don't know, a lot.

157
00:07:17,835 --> 00:07:19,236
It's just that
it's a unit of measurement

158
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,037
I hear invoked more and more.
"A lot of my friends."

159
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:24,007
Mainstream media's been making us
look like idiots since this thing started.

160
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,776
Don't refer to the mainstream
media out there.

161
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,245
It always sounds like a losing team
complaining about the ref.

162
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,247
'Cause that's what
you always make it sound like.

163
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:34,284
Excuse me one second.

164
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:38,821
<i>Two minutes.</i>

165
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:40,556
We've spidered
every social networking site

166
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:42,391
and public board
looking for Hamni8.

167
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:45,161
We've sent an e-mail to Hamni8
at every public domain,

168
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:47,464
including the ISPs
most likely to service that region.

169
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:49,599
We've got some bounce backs,
but no responses.

170
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:51,435
We're out of here.

171
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:53,203
What's going on?

172
00:07:53,237 --> 00:07:55,072
Late Wednesday night,
they found a tweet

173
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:56,974
from a user in the area,
Hamni8.

174
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,609
A fast series of tweets
where he describes Genoa.

175
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:01,044
- We think he's describing Genoa.
<i>- He is describing it.</i>

176
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,646
- Jesus.
- He's dead.

177
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,781
- We don't know that.
- What's the other option?

178
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:07,316
- That he can't afford his cell plan anymore.
- Come on--

179
00:08:07,351 --> 00:08:10,019
In most of the developing world,
phones and plans are extremely expensive

180
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:12,856
relative to income, and almost all are prepaid.
This was two years ago.

181
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,993
He's standing there describing gas
being dropped on a village.

182
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:18,396
Then the tweets stop and you think
it's because his cell plan ran out?

183
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,631
Maybe they stopped then because
we were jamming their frequency.

184
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,767
- I'm saying it's years later.
- Fuck!

185
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,740
- It's just gone.
- I need to get Shelly.

186
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,908
It's time.

187
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,343
What do we do now?

188
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,779
Something's got to fall
into our lap.

189
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:37,015
<i>Something's got to fall out of the sky
and right into our lap.</i>

190
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,384
A preposterous stroke of luck
has to occur.

191
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,853
Neal, I meant to tell you.

192
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,188
A guy down at OWS
was telling a campfire story

193
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:46,124
about working for an NGO
and getting the NGO shut down

194
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,260
by the Pakistani government
because he wrote a report

195
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,729
saying US troops
used chemical weapons on civilians.

196
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,097
You should talk to him.

197
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,833
You can just follow me, okay?

198
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,570
- Wait, what?
- Did that just--

199
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,840
Shelly, wait!
Stop!

200
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,376
- What did you say?
- The Pakistani shut down the NGO.

201
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,612
- She needs to be in the studio.
- No. What was the reason?

202
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,615
He wrote a report that said US troops
were using chemical weapons.

203
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,150
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

204
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,384
Does he tend to hang out
in the same place

205
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,719
- in Zucotti Park every night?
- We are not hanging out.

206
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:15,920
- Neal.
- I understand.

207
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,322
Yes, he's in the same place
every night.

208
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,124
- Yes, I can take you there.
- Take her to the studio.

209
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,926
This way.

210
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,464
Okay. Okay.

211
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,001
<i>30 seconds back.</i>

212
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,403
And here comes dinner.

213
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,472
<i>- How you doing?</i>
- Good, thank you.

214
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,674
- Yeah, I got it.
- I'm sorry?

215
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,743
I was talking to my producer.

216
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,244
- How do I look?
- Good.

217
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,146
No, producer again.

218
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,349
- Is he just screwing with her?
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:46,718
- Come on.
<i>- In three, two...</i>

220
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,721
It's been two weeks
since a group of protesters

221
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,724
began camping out
in Zucotti Park here in New York City.

222
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,594
<i>The Occupy Wall Street movement
has turned to social media</i>

223
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,730
and held marches through the streets of
the financial district.

224
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,033
Here in the studio today
is one of the leaders

225
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,868
of Occupy Wall Street,
Shelly Wexler.

226
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,703
- Don't take the bait.
<i>- Shelly, thanks for being with us.</i>

227
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,406
It's good to be here,
but I am not one of the leaders of OWS.

228
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,675
- <i>We don't have leaders.</i>
<i>- Is that a good idea?</i>

229
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:12,112
- Not having leaders?
- Yeah.

230
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:14,648
Yes, because this way,
everyone's sure to have a voice.

231
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,683
Sounds like a lot of people
talking at once.

232
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:19,518
But tell us in a few words
what OWS is protesting.

233
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,654
We are protesting
a variety of issues--

234
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:23,690
The co-opting of the government
by the rich,

235
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,524
the lack of any prosecution
for the crimes

236
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,760
that led to
the collapse of 2008,

237
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,895
Citizens United,
social inequality.

238
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,263
So not any particular thing?

239
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,166
Not one particular thing.

240
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,134
<i>You're protesting
against lots of things?</i>

241
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,737
<i>The list of things
we're protesting against</i>

242
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,106
<i>is as varied
as the protesters themselves.</i>

243
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,509
I've seen protesters holding signs that say,
"We are the 99%."

244
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:45,545
- Yes.
- I am the 1%.

245
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,247
Some people would say I'm overpaid,
but I'm not.

246
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,183
I'm paid exactly
what the market will bear,

247
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,851
which means I'm paid
what I'm worth.

248
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,687
So which system would you
replace capitalism with?

249
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,792
We wouldn't--
<i>I</i> wouldn't replace it with any system.

250
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,327
I would make the system fairer.

251
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,895
- By passing new laws?
<i>- Yes.</i>

252
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,965
- It's Congress who does that.
- Yes.

253
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,402
It's legislation like Dodd-Frank
that the banks really fear, right?

254
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,470
Yes.

255
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,272
If your congressman
or your senator

256
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,808
or the Chairman of the House
Financial Services Committee

257
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,077
or the Speaker of the House
wanted to hear the demands

258
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:19,679
<i>of OWS,
who would they meet with?</i>

259
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:21,615
We're not looking
for a meeting.

260
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:24,484
- <i>They wouldn't be able to meet with anyone, right?</i>
- Look--

261
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:27,521
I'm trying to find the virtue
of a leaderless movement

262
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,223
where everyone's
voices are heard.

263
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:30,991
<i>That isn't the point.</i>

264
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,926
We want everyone to look
at Occupy Wall Street

265
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:35,529
and ask themselves the question,
"Why is this happening?"

266
00:11:35,563 --> 00:11:37,397
I think that's
been taken care of.

267
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:40,334
<i>But what happens after
people ask themselves that?</i>

268
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,069
- Change, we hope.
- How?

269
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:44,421
The same way change
has always happened.

270
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:47,341
What is your best-case scenario
for how this ends?

271
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,978
- That it doesn't end.
- Oh, God.

272
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:52,546
- That it doesn't end?
<i>- That's right.</i>

273
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,682
Even if you put the heads
of the banks in jail,

274
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:56,784
<i>overturn a Supreme
Court decision,</i>

275
00:11:56,818 --> 00:11:59,386
ensure greater social equality
and give everybody money,

276
00:11:59,421 --> 00:12:01,822
you're still going to be
sleeping in Zucotti Park?

277
00:12:01,857 --> 00:12:05,260
Like most of the media,
I don't think you're taking this seriously.

278
00:12:05,294 --> 00:12:07,862
Is there any chance
that's because <i>you're</i> not?

279
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:12,233
- Hey, it didn't go that badly.
- Fuck off!

280
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:14,669
- Come on.
- I am humiliated and in shock.

281
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:15,970
This whole thing is messed up

282
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,039
and he's a fucking asshole,
by the way.

283
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:21,075
- He's not.
- Trying to be funny at the expense of the guest.

284
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,343
I don't think it was
as bad as you think.

285
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:23,744
Which way do I go
to get out of here?

286
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,646
- You need to take me to the guy.
- What?

287
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:28,616
- The guy in the park.
- You think I'm disposed to doing you a favor?

288
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,384
No, Shelly.
Shelly, we need to meet this guy.

289
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,253
- We need to read the report he wrote.
- No.

290
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:33,287
- Shelly.
- Forget it.

291
00:12:33,322 --> 00:12:34,689
No, I can't tell you
what this is about,

292
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:36,457
but it's way too important
to use as a payback--

293
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:38,692
I could have gone anywhere.
I did this as a favor to you.

294
00:12:38,727 --> 00:12:40,627
I need you to take me
to this guy.

295
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:42,095
Then we're both
having a bad night.

296
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,598
He didn't do anything to you.
You tanked.

297
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,577
She's gone.

298
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,154
Good evening.
Welcome to the Radisson Concord.

299
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:42,289
Good evening.
We're with the Romney Press Corps.

300
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:44,658
Three rooms under James Harper,

301
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,360
Hallie Shea and...

302
00:13:46,394 --> 00:13:48,762
You know what?
I don't know your first name.

303
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,497
- I'm sorry.
- Stillman's my first name.

304
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:52,533
- Stillman's your first name?
- Yeah.

305
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:53,834
- What's your last name?
- Frank.

306
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:55,436
You sure it's not
the other way around?

307
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,970
It's three rooms.
Harper, Frank, and Shea.

308
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:59,106
I'm sorry,
I'm not seeing anything.

309
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,708
You said you were
with the Romney bus?

310
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:01,909
Yeah.

311
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:04,011
The Romney Press Corps
is all checked in.

312
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:07,248
Mm-hmm.
I understand what's happened.

313
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:09,917
- We got off the Romney bus.
- Oh, 'cause you said you were--

314
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:12,253
Yeah, we're still covering the campaign,
we're just--

315
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:15,456
It's not--
We're staging a protest.

316
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,658
I don't want to bore you
with the details.

317
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:20,794
It has to do with accountability
and access and just--

318
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:23,998
So we got off the bus

319
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:26,434
and now I understand
that the campaign

320
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:29,170
isn't going to be arranging our hotel.
Does that make sense?

321
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:31,072
- No, you should explain it some more.
- So we'll need three rooms.

322
00:14:31,107 --> 00:14:34,575
I'm sorry.
We're very full with the campaign staff

323
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,910
and the press.

324
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:38,413
I'm showing I have one room.

325
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:40,581
That was a predictable plot twist,
don't you think?

326
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:43,785
Hey, guys.
What do you say, Slim Jim?

327
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,454
- Checking in.
- I thought you said the press was checked in.

328
00:14:46,488 --> 00:14:48,957
The press that's on the bus,
the press we're responsible for.

329
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:51,993
- Ah, not the freedom riders.
- We have a room.

330
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:54,196
- I have seven rooms.
- Of course.

331
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:57,365
Six of which I'm willing to rent out
to anyone who says, "Romney rocks."

332
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:00,535
I'll say "Romney rocks" if you give me
30 minutes with the candidate.

333
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:02,570
Why do you keep asking when you know
the answer is going to be no?

334
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:03,971
So I can say I kept asking.

335
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,974
I hate the press in ways
you can't even comprehend.

336
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:09,109
<i>- I can comprehend the ways.
- And hating the press</i>

337
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,111
is an excellent credential
for a press officer.

338
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:14,614
We'll be in the bar
or on our half-empty floor.

339
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,082
Two queen beds?

340
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,317
- Can we get a cot?
- Absolutely.

341
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,618
- And some walls?
- It's one night.

342
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,186
- I call the cot.
- Got it.

343
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,288
These things aren't supposed to happen to me.
I went to Vassar.

344
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,356
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

345
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,857
And Vassar versa, I'm sure.

346
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:26,893
How long you been keeping
that one in your pocket?

347
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,322
A while.

348
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,400
_

349
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:34,768
My friend's plane is about
to take off for Uganda.

350
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:36,503
Why is she going to Africa?

351
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:39,373
He. A guy named
Gary Cooper.

352
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,544
<i>New York to Dubai to Entebbe.</i>

353
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:45,412
- Yeah.
- Emirates first class.

354
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:46,947
It's like flying
in the Bellagio.

355
00:15:46,981 --> 00:15:50,184
So you have a comprehensive
understanding of our operating budget.

356
00:15:50,218 --> 00:15:52,853
- I'm just saying.
- Talent and EPs fly first class,

357
00:15:52,888 --> 00:15:54,355
senior producers fly business,

358
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,657
and Gary and I get
duct-taped to the wing.

359
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:58,826
What time did you
land in Entebbe?

360
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,994
Around 8:00 A.M.
local time.

361
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:02,330
We were picked up
by a fixer named Ronald.

362
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:03,431
He works for ACN?

363
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,133
We don't have
a bureau in Africa.

364
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:06,435
He's freelance.

365
00:16:06,469 --> 00:16:08,671
He works for National
Geographic Channel,

366
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:10,306
<i>The Amazing Race</i>,
that kind of thing.

367
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,207
<i>The Army doesn't trust us much,</i>

368
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:14,676
so before we could go to the base in Kasenyi,
we had to go to the orphanage,

369
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:17,813
which was in the Nakapiripirit District
in the Karamoja region.

370
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:20,282
Excuse me,
how do you spell Nakapiripirit?

371
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:21,584
<i>Two As and four Is.</i>

372
00:16:21,618 --> 00:16:23,152
It's a four-to-nine
hour drive

373
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:25,154
depending on the condition
of the roads.

374
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,356
What condition
could the roads possibly be

375
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,625
that the drive time
fluctuates four to nine hours?

376
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,395
Sometimes there's mud.
Sometimes there's a genocide.

377
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,030
But there wasn't much
of either that day,

378
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,900
so we got there
by early afternoon.

379
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:49,148
<i>Gary rode in back for 100 miles</i>

380
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:52,284
'cause Ronald told him
he was gonna see drug lords.

381
00:17:26,553 --> 00:17:27,920
Drug lords?

382
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:30,322
You're an idiot.

383
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:31,957
There were no drug lords.

384
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:34,559
And I didn't see one animal
I haven't seen in my apartment.

385
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:36,895
We were met
by Lt. Bill Casey,

386
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,065
the Community Relations Coordinator
for the 490th Civil Affairs Battalion.

387
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,002
Bill Casey.
I'm the Community Relations Coordinator

388
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:45,937
- for the 490th Civil Affairs Battalion.
- Maggie Jordan.

389
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:47,572
Gary Cooper.
Nice to meet you, Lieutenant.

390
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:50,107
Is your name really Gary Cooper?

391
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:52,109
You'd think I'd have gotten
tired of that by now.

392
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:53,711
<i>We didn't have that much time.</i>

393
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:55,746
We just wanted
to get it over with,

394
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,882
so Gary started getting
B-roll of the soldiers.

395
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,750
Kids here have either
lost their families

396
00:17:59,784 --> 00:18:02,319
to regional conflicts,
HIV/AIDS, malaria.

397
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:05,021
This project lets us give
the kids medical checkups,

398
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:06,890
books, textbooks.

399
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:07,857
Right now
they've got two rooms--

400
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:09,525
A classroom
and a living quarters.

401
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,793
We're building another
two rooms here today.

402
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:13,328
One of the things
they have there are cattle raiders.

403
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:15,330
- Cattle raiders?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

404
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:18,333
They're heavily armed,
usually with AK-47s,

405
00:18:18,368 --> 00:18:20,836
and they come
and steal your cattle.

406
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,938
And then rape and kill people.

407
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:26,941
After we'd gotten enough film on the soldiers,
we went inside.

408
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:29,144
- Asia!
<i>- Good.</i>

409
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:32,181
- South America!
- Good.

410
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:35,651
- North America!
<i>- Excellent!</i>

411
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:38,287
Antarctica!

412
00:18:42,225 --> 00:18:44,125
That's where I'm from.

413
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,629
I'm Pastor Moses.
You must be Maggie Jordan.

414
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:50,399
- Yes, sir.
- The children are learning geography.

415
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:53,269
Don't let me stop you.

416
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,307
- No. No, no, no!
- They think the camera's a gun.

417
00:18:58,342 --> 00:19:00,710
- Put the camera down.
- Children.

418
00:19:00,744 --> 00:19:03,046
It's okay. Shh, it's okay.

419
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:06,884
And they thought
you were cattle raiders?

420
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,256
Yeah.

421
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:14,492
And that's it?
That's what happened?

422
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:51,863
- I'm sorry?
- That's what happened?

423
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:55,133
No.

424
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:01,872
- What?
- Friday night, the woman from OWS--

425
00:20:01,907 --> 00:20:04,108
- Shelly Wexler.
- She said there's a guy at Zucotti Park

426
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:06,277
who wrote a report
for an NGO in Pakistan

427
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:08,813
that got the NGO shut down
by the Pakistani government.

428
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:11,149
The report was about
the US using chemical weapons.

429
00:20:11,183 --> 00:20:12,917
You didn't get the name of the guy
who wrote the report?

430
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:16,253
She doesn't know the name of the guy,
only where he hangs out in the park.

431
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:17,788
You should have got her to
take you there after she was done.

432
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:20,391
Well, that was the idea,
but then after the interview with Will,

433
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:22,092
she was angry and bolted.

434
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:24,662
- How angry?
- She punched me in the stomach.

435
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:26,363
She's probably
calmed down by now.

436
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:27,931
I called her all weekend
and she's willing to negotiate.

437
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:29,766
- We're not paying her.
- She doesn't want money.

438
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,468
- She wants an apology.
- Apologize.

439
00:20:31,503 --> 00:20:33,770
First of all, I did.
Second, she doesn't want the apology from me.

440
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:36,973
And third, she punched me
in the stomach really hard.

441
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,241
Who does she want
the apology from?

442
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:40,109
- Will.
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

443
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:42,612
- <i>On air.</i>
- She wants an on-air apology from Will?

444
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:43,980
- Yeah.
- That's insane.

445
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:46,515
- She found him smug.
- Me, too.

446
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,917
- He wouldn't have to mean it or anything.
- Forget it.

447
00:20:48,952 --> 00:20:51,220
This is it.
The trail is cold after this.

448
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:53,289
Couldn't you maybe convince him
to take one for the team?

449
00:20:53,323 --> 00:20:55,124
Will is not aware of Genoa.

450
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:56,959
Do you mind if I ask why not?

451
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:58,727
- <i>Because.</i>
- Because?

452
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:03,231
Because I might need him
for the red team.

453
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,303
- So you believe it?
- No, I--

454
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:09,338
No, it's just--

455
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:12,208
Look, it's a completely
unbelievable story,

456
00:21:12,242 --> 00:21:13,610
but I can't ignore evidence.

457
00:21:13,644 --> 00:21:15,178
It's not like I'm in Congress.

458
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:17,646
If you believe it enough
to be thinking about a red team,

459
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:19,181
you believe it enough.

460
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:20,917
You have to talk to Will.

461
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:34,198
How'd you lose a bus, Jim?

462
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,134
<i>It's a bus.</i>

463
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:40,171
It's big and it's slow.

464
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:43,174
And it's a bus.

465
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:45,744
You let a big bus get away.

466
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:48,514
- This is a nice picture of her.
- Who?

467
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,216
Maggie.

468
00:22:10,013 --> 00:22:11,580
I shouldn't have
turned around to look.

469
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:13,515
- Mm-hmm.
- Everybody all right?

470
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,483
I'm good.

471
00:22:18,453 --> 00:22:19,720
That's me.

472
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:21,321
You paired your phone
to the car?

473
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:23,756
I got here first.

474
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:35,966
- Hello?
<i>- Hallie, what the hell is going on?</i>

475
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,101
<i>Why is everybody but us
writing about the job speech</i>

476
00:22:38,135 --> 00:22:39,669
<i>Romney's gonna give
in Las Vegas?</i>

477
00:22:39,704 --> 00:22:41,571
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, Evan.

478
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:43,740
The rest of the press corps
got an advanced copy.

479
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:45,775
- <i>Why didn't you?</i>
- I wasn't on the bus.

480
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,676
<i>You said this stunt wasn't
gonna fuck anything up.</i>

481
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:49,378
- It won't.
<i>- It just did.</i>

482
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:50,679
I'm at all the campaign stops

483
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:52,013
and I'll be in Vegas
for the speech.

484
00:22:52,048 --> 00:22:53,681
<i>But everybody else
got an advanced copy</i>

485
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:55,183
<i>and they're writing about it.</i>

486
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:56,451
<i>We look like we're
doing this from home.</i>

487
00:22:56,485 --> 00:22:57,985
We've got something they don't.

488
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,953
- <i>What?</i>
- Guts.

489
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:02,722
<i>I couldn't be less in the mood
for you to be a wiseass, Hallie.</i>

490
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,757
<i>I'm giving you $500
a week plus expenses.</i>

491
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,560
To be fair, you're not giving it to me.
You're paying it to me.

492
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,995
<i>No, if I don't get something back,
I'm giving it to you.</i>

493
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,631
<i>So unless you want to put on heels
and fuck me for an hour,</i>

494
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,967
<i>you need to stop being
a little bitch.</i>

495
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:19,037
- Yeah.
<i>- Tell me if you can't do this</i>

496
00:23:19,071 --> 00:23:21,772
- <i>so I can find someone who can.</i>
- No.

497
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,108
No, I can do this.

498
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:29,979
You left <i>The Denver Post</i>
for that?

499
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:31,847
Feel free to be superior.

500
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:34,283
He doesn't set
the bar very high.

501
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:39,887
The world's first fat tax
was announced in Denmark.

502
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:41,089
- That's mean.
- How?

503
00:23:41,123 --> 00:23:42,823
Taxing people
who are overweight?

504
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:45,125
No, imbecile.
It's not a tax on people.

505
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,660
It's a tax on saturated fat.

506
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:48,529
But you're right,
that would have been mean.

507
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:50,697
<i>About an hour ago
on </i>Fox and Friends<i>,</i>

508
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:53,032
Hank Williams Jr. compared Boehner
and Obama playing golf

509
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:55,101
to Hitler and Netanyahu
playing golf.

510
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:57,270
Tell me something
and tell it to me straight.

511
00:23:57,304 --> 00:23:59,238
Who is Hank Williams Jr.?

512
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,273
He was a country music star
until about an hour ago.

513
00:24:01,308 --> 00:24:04,844
"Pentagon has decided military chaplains
may now perform oral sex."

514
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,846
What?

515
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,649
Give me my real rundown.

516
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:11,852
Idiots.

517
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:13,820
"The Pentagon has decided
military chaplains

518
00:24:13,855 --> 00:24:15,922
may now perform
same-sex marriages."

519
00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:19,092
And, Kendra, I apologize,
but the <i>Washington Post</i>

520
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:20,894
reported last night
that Rick Perry

521
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:23,397
leases a hunting ranch
called Niggerhead.

522
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:24,698
I accept your apology on behalf

523
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,200
of all the black people
in the room.

524
00:24:26,234 --> 00:24:29,002
- I get that that was a thinly veiled--
- It wasn't veiled.

525
00:24:29,036 --> 00:24:31,705
Okay. "Obama defends loan to Solyndra,
calling it a good--"

526
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:34,440
Stop doing that!

527
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:36,509
Good morning.

528
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,415
What happened with
the tweet from Hamni8?

529
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,285
They can't find Hamni8.
But something else happened.

530
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,621
The woman from OWS
who was on Friday night--

531
00:24:47,656 --> 00:24:49,290
- Has murdered Will?
- She's not happy.

532
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:51,926
And that's relevant
because she says that a guy

533
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:54,128
who hangs out in her area
at Zucotti Park

534
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:57,031
has mentioned a report he wrote
for an NGO in Pakistan

535
00:24:57,066 --> 00:24:59,100
about us using
chemical weapons.

536
00:24:59,135 --> 00:25:02,637
She was gonna lead Neal and Jerry there
after the show, but then--

537
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:04,172
- She met Will.
- Yeah.

538
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:06,875
- Well, fix that.
- How?

539
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:08,710
You put a help wanted ad
in the paper

540
00:25:08,744 --> 00:25:12,614
- for someone who can do your job.
- Good. Anything else?

541
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:15,650
- I just want to know that it didn't happen.
- That's not easy to do.

542
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:18,954
You should include in the ad that applicants
need to able to do hard things.

543
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:21,957
- Got it.
- When's Jim coming back from New Hampshire?

544
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:24,826
- Soon.
- He gets paid way too much for an embed.

545
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,462
Do you know what we pay embeds?
Some weeks it's in coupons.

546
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:29,631
I'll see you later.

547
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:35,670
Kendra, run the meeting.
I'll be back in a minute.

548
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:37,171
Okay.

549
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:38,839
Good morning.

550
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:41,275
- Hi.
<i>- So, great news.</i>

551
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:43,510
Let me tell you
something about liberals.

552
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:45,379
He didn't paint
the word on the rock.

553
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,548
His father didn't paint
the word on the rock.

554
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:50,417
And the word was painted over
after his family leased the ranch.

555
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:52,320
You're absolutely right
and that's a good point.

556
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:55,090
But I wanted to talk to you about--
What does that have to do with liberals?

557
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:57,462
You all should be asking yourselves
if you're condemning him

558
00:25:57,496 --> 00:25:59,606
because he's from the South
and this is a good way

559
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,948
to distance yourselves
from our shared heritage.

560
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,890
Let's talk for a second about
unintended consequences.

561
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:09,393
- Sure.
- The woman we had on Friday night,

562
00:26:09,427 --> 00:26:12,129
- from OWS, Shelly Wexler...
- Yeah.

563
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:13,998
Would you be willing
to apologize to her?

564
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,132
- Sure.
- On air?

565
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,801
- Absolutely.
- So no?

566
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:18,836
What were the consequences?

567
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:20,471
Jerry's been chasing a story
for a few weeks

568
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:22,608
- and I'm not gonna tell you what it is.
- Why?

569
00:26:22,642 --> 00:26:25,111
If I tell you the reason,
you'll be more curious about the story.

570
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:27,212
But now I'm more curious
about the reason.

571
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:30,984
There's some evidence
to suggest

572
00:26:31,018 --> 00:26:33,920
that the Army is thinking about having
different uniforms

573
00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:35,488
for home and away games.

574
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:38,458
I don't believe
that's really the story.

575
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:40,527
At some point,
I might need you for the red team.

576
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:42,695
You could have just said that.
I understand that.

577
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,163
- I'm not a child.
- Okay.

578
00:26:44,198 --> 00:26:45,732
- You have to tell me what the story is.
- No!

579
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:48,501
At least tell me how it relates to
the woman from OWS.

580
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:51,103
She can lead us to someone
who might be able to help,

581
00:26:51,138 --> 00:26:53,673
but she won't
unless you apologize.

582
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:55,608
Her movement is idiotic
and she's unprepared.

583
00:26:55,675 --> 00:26:57,676
So as a courtesy,
I was dismissive.

584
00:26:57,711 --> 00:26:59,478
What does she want
an apology for?

585
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:02,648
- Being smug.
- That-- Really?

586
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:05,417
I know. I've never heard anybody
say that about you before

587
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:07,619
and I certainly can't
identify personally.

588
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:09,821
You're just chock-full of beans today,
aren't you?

589
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:11,622
So that's a hard no
on apologizing?

590
00:27:14,138 --> 00:27:16,560
I was asked to ask.

591
00:27:19,864 --> 00:27:21,765
Come in.

592
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:25,235
- Hey, how was your weekend?
- It was good.

593
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,471
It was good and then
I saw <i>Titanic</i> for the first time.

594
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:29,206
You'd never seen it before?

595
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,474
You know how I am
about sad movies

596
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:32,510
and the title suggested
it wasn't gonna end well.

597
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:34,746
But I still
didn't see it coming.

598
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,149
Mac, what is more important
than the people you--

599
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:39,585
Kodak is dropping
like a sack of flour.

600
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:41,687
I'll never let go, Kodak.
I'll never let go.

601
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:44,223
But people should really sell their stock
in Kodak because by this afternoon--

602
00:27:44,258 --> 00:27:46,993
- I need you.
- That's all you ever have to say.

603
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,628
- Get it together.
- Yeah, all right.

604
00:27:48,662 --> 00:27:50,263
<i>The woman we had on
from OWS Friday night</i>

605
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:52,432
- <i>thought she was mistreated.</i>
- She was.

606
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,568
And it's possible that she can
lead us to information

607
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:56,804
that can help with a story
I can't tell you about yet.

608
00:27:56,872 --> 00:27:58,472
But to do that,
we have to make her happy.

609
00:27:58,506 --> 00:28:01,074
- How can I help?
- Neal's gonna set up a meeting.

610
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:03,777
And you're gonna--
You're just gonna make her feel

611
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:06,279
like she's being heard
by a financial expert.

612
00:28:06,314 --> 00:28:09,249
You're Sloan Sabbith
and you went to meet her.

613
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:11,217
- Just lather it on.
- Got it.

614
00:28:11,252 --> 00:28:13,520
Whatever she says,
you couldn't agree with more.

615
00:28:13,554 --> 00:28:15,555
I'm gonna lather up just to
honor the memory of Jack Dawson.

616
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:16,723
- From the boat?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

617
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:18,859
Okay, but it's not lather up,
it's--

618
00:28:18,893 --> 00:28:21,328
Don't worry about it.
Talk to Neal.

619
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,400
<i>Will McAvoy is an asshole.</i>

620
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:27,769
<i>I know how you feel.</i>

621
00:28:27,803 --> 00:28:29,971
But the thing is, he's not.

622
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:31,873
<i>You had a rough time.
That's okay.</i>

623
00:28:31,908 --> 00:28:34,376
You've got information
that you don't realize

624
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,879
could help Neal and his team
with a story I'm certain--

625
00:28:36,913 --> 00:28:39,581
<i>Certain</i> you'd want told.

626
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:43,451
- What's the story?
- I shouldn't have said that,

627
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:45,286
because I don't have
the first idea what the story is.

628
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:46,788
What the fuck
is with you people?

629
00:28:46,822 --> 00:28:48,523
She doesn't know
what the story is by design.

630
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:50,525
On a big story, you want to bring in
some people at the end

631
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,662
and run everything by fresh eyes
and let them try to punch holes in it.

632
00:28:53,696 --> 00:28:55,463
They're called the red team.

633
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:56,965
When's your story
supposed to air?

634
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,169
This?
Probably never.

635
00:29:00,203 --> 00:29:02,838
You know,
I teach three classes on Mondays.

636
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:04,807
I came up here.
I'm supposed to be impressed?

637
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:06,942
- No one's trying to impress you.
- Yes, you are.

638
00:29:06,977 --> 00:29:08,177
Because here's what happened.

639
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:09,678
This woman's here
at Shake Shack

640
00:29:09,712 --> 00:29:12,914
because someone asked
Will to apologize and Will said no.

641
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:15,417
Do you see how things are worse
than they were before?

642
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:20,655
'Cause before you could assume
that no one ever asked Will,

643
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:22,290
and now it's pretty clear

644
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:24,592
that because of the story,
he was asked.

645
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:27,094
- You guys didn't think this through.
- No.

646
00:29:27,128 --> 00:29:28,795
This is exactly
why we need a red team.

647
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,566
Shelly, can we just say
that we're honestly very sorry

648
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,768
- that appearing on ACN was an unpleasant experience?
- Please, no.

649
00:29:34,803 --> 00:29:37,071
Your apology,
which was meaningless in the first place,

650
00:29:37,105 --> 00:29:39,039
is now just a symbol
of the other guy's refusal to apologize.

651
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:40,507
This is getting a little nutty.

652
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:42,443
Shelly, can you just tell Neal
what he needs to know?

653
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:44,444
And I am supposed
to be impressed

654
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,446
'cause here comes your money honey
all solicitous.

655
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,148
- Hey! I can hear you.
- Like I'm a fucking rube

656
00:29:48,182 --> 00:29:50,550
who's never seen a TV star before
or who would even care.

657
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:52,285
- <i>Listen. Wait.</i>
- I teach college.

658
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,787
Hang on. Let me ask you something
and I'd like an honest answer.

659
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,424
Sure.

660
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,659
- Do you really think I'm a TV star?
- You know...

661
00:30:00,693 --> 00:30:03,795
You called me a money honey
and I made a self-deprecating joke.

662
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,899
I didn't do it in front of a million and a half people
and this isn't a joke to me.

663
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,801
I've got to leave.
You guys are condescending.

664
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:10,770
Really?
'Cause I'm pretty sure I wasn't just the one

665
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:13,973
who distinguished myself from rubes by saying,
"I teach college."

666
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:17,143
Did Will say no
when someone said,

667
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,278
"We need you to apologize
to Shelly Wexler.

668
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:21,146
We badly need you
to apologize"?

669
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:24,483
I wasn't in the room,
but I'm sure he said,

670
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:27,252
"Hell, no, and who the fuck
is Shelly Wexler?"

671
00:30:27,287 --> 00:30:30,756
Well, now you know
how much of a prick he is.

672
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:38,163
Yeah.

673
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:40,966
No.
Sloan was smug.

674
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:45,170
So there was this kid
named Daniel

675
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:47,873
who was by himself
the whole time.

676
00:30:54,147 --> 00:30:56,081
Who's he?

677
00:30:57,217 --> 00:30:59,052
That's Daniel.

678
00:30:59,086 --> 00:31:01,421
His parents are both alive.

679
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:03,590
I'm a family friend.

680
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:05,659
His father has a lot of cattle

681
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:09,196
and there have been some clashes
with Pokot raiders from Kenya.

682
00:31:10,866 --> 00:31:13,969
<i>So Daniel's here
to be safe for a few days.</i>

683
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,872
I started talking to him.

684
00:31:16,906 --> 00:31:19,474
Do you want me to read
that book to you?

685
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:22,979
I'm not gonna take it.

686
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:25,948
You can hold it and be the page-turner
and I'll just read it.

687
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:32,521
Come on.
Scoot over.

688
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:47,669
"This is the house.

689
00:31:47,704 --> 00:31:50,172
The house on East 88th Street.

690
00:31:50,206 --> 00:31:53,141
Mr. and Mrs. Primm
and their son Joshua

691
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:54,676
live in the house
on East 88th Street."

692
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:58,947
I read it to him maybe
three times.

693
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:03,585
- Again.
- Okay.

694
00:32:06,623 --> 00:32:09,124
- Three times.
<i>- Again.</i>

695
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,360
We've read it seven times now.

696
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:17,433
That's a lot of trust, Daniel.

697
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:20,302
All right, one more.

698
00:32:20,337 --> 00:32:24,473
"But if Lyle was happy,
he was making someone else unhappy.

699
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:25,874
Perfectly miserable, in fact.

700
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,110
That someone else
was Loretta."

701
00:32:28,144 --> 00:32:30,145
"The house
on East 88th Street."

702
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,347
"...the voice called out.
Lyle recognized the voice."

703
00:32:32,382 --> 00:32:34,182
"Have you seen
a crocodile going past?

704
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:35,951
He was wearing
a red scarf."

705
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:38,120
"If Lyle was happy,
he was making someone else unhappy."

706
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:41,190
"I have no information
about a crocodile wearing a red..."

707
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:43,059
Scarf.

708
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,728
"There was little they could do,
at least for the moment,

709
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:48,865
to prevent Mr. Grumps
from putting Lyle in the zoo."

710
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:50,700
He's never seen
hair like yours.

711
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:53,737
That color's called blonde,
Daniel,

712
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,239
and it's nothing but trouble.

713
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,574
<i>Maggie.</i>

714
00:33:00,944 --> 00:33:02,946
Ronald.

715
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,915
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Time to go.

716
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,350
No, we can't drive
these roads at night.

717
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:10,287
- It's not night.
- It will be.

718
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,724
When were you gonna tell us
we couldn't drive back?

719
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,559
I just did.

720
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:21,532
- Lt. Casey.
<i>- Yes, ma'am?</i>

721
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,803
Could we possibly get a ride back
with you guys?

722
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,872
- We're flying out.
- Even better.

723
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:28,207
We're going to Djibouti.

724
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:30,309
Is that near where we're going?

725
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:32,211
No.

726
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:35,748
You're not a great fixer,
you know that?

727
00:33:35,782 --> 00:33:39,518
I don't know how <i>The Amazing Race</i>
is as amazing as it is.

728
00:33:44,592 --> 00:33:45,925
Again.

729
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:04,178
<i>I don't really
understand your reasons</i>

730
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:06,714
<i>for not being on the campaign,
but I'm going to have to insist</i>

731
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:08,282
that you at least be near
the campaign.

732
00:34:08,317 --> 00:34:11,052
I am. Everybody's here.
I'm making all the stops,

733
00:34:11,086 --> 00:34:12,620
<i>or at least the ones
I can MapQuest.</i>

734
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:13,954
You can't just follow the bus?

735
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,589
They're making
really fast buses now.

736
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:17,558
Do me a favor.

737
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:19,460
- Romney gave a statement.
- Yeah?

738
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:21,128
He called the name
of the ranch offensive.

739
00:34:21,163 --> 00:34:22,663
He should be asked
about the church.

740
00:34:22,698 --> 00:34:23,764
Can you get a comment
from someone?

741
00:34:23,799 --> 00:34:25,332
On that?
I doubt it.

742
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:29,070
Try hard. Charlie doesn't know
what you're doing there.

743
00:34:29,104 --> 00:34:30,705
All right.

744
00:34:39,181 --> 00:34:41,449
- Taylor.
- Jim.

745
00:34:41,484 --> 00:34:42,851
- I need to ask--
- How was your day?

746
00:34:42,885 --> 00:34:44,586
Fine, thanks.
I need to ask

747
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,554
about the governor's response
to Rick Perry's ranch.

748
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:48,256
There was a statement
in this morning's e-mail,

749
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,558
which you don't get,
so you're free to watch TV.

750
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:52,127
I know he said he thought
it was offensive.

751
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:55,064
He does and that is the official comment
of the Romney campaign.

752
00:34:55,098 --> 00:34:56,799
And now we are going
back to business,

753
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,134
which for me
is a glass of red wine right now.

754
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:01,971
He was a leader in his church
in 1977, right?

755
00:35:02,005 --> 00:35:04,006
Do you think I'm gonna talk about
the Mormon Church?

756
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,808
By commenting on the Perry ranch
you already have

757
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:08,778
because it wasn't until 1978
that Mormons allowed Mormons to be black.

758
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:11,280
People of faith
are also people of free will

759
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:14,483
and they are able to disagree
with their church on a number of issues.

760
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:16,118
The governor was one
of the leaders of his church.

761
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:17,887
- Did he ever object--
- And Joe Biden is Catholic.

762
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:20,122
Catholics don't allow
women to be priests.

763
00:35:20,157 --> 00:35:22,191
Is Joe fighting a war on women?

764
00:35:22,225 --> 00:35:23,826
Is that the official comment
of the Romney campaign?

765
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,527
You know,
go fuck yourself, Jim.

766
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:27,530
That is the official comment
of the Romney campaign.

767
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:37,774
All right.

768
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:41,344
All right,
just tell me what you need

769
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:44,247
to forget I said that.

770
00:35:53,257 --> 00:35:55,625
You're gonna have
a 30-minute one-on-one

771
00:35:55,693 --> 00:35:58,261
with the governor
tonight at 10:00.

772
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,468
Thanks.

773
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:17,579
I, too, believe Will and Sloan
can be a little smug

774
00:36:17,614 --> 00:36:19,014
and I think you guys are
showing a lot of wisdom

775
00:36:19,048 --> 00:36:20,815
by having me
be the one to fix it.

776
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,617
You were really
the only one left.

777
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:25,119
- The only guy for the job.
- The only one left.

778
00:36:25,154 --> 00:36:28,055
- The only one who can get it done.
- There was nobody else.

779
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,391
- Nobody but me.
- Left in the office.

780
00:36:30,425 --> 00:36:32,226
- One man--
- There she is. Hey, Shell.

781
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,128
I have another class
from 8:00 to 10:00

782
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,430
and this is my only break and I don't want to
spend that much of it with you,

783
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:38,132
so let's get this over with.

784
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:39,466
This is Don Keefer.

785
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:41,535
I'm the executive producer
of our 10:00 hour

786
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,971
<i>Right Now With Elliot Hirsch</i>
and I'll give you a segment.

787
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:45,505
It'll be a much
gentler interview.

788
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,040
And if I came on
Elliot Hirsch's show,

789
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:48,575
would I be able to talk
about my treatment?

790
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,144
The treatment OWS got
during the first interview?

791
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:53,513
You'd be able
to talk about OWS,

792
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:56,316
but I can't produce your revenge fantasy
if that's what you're asking.

793
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,486
- Please stop arranging meetings.
- Just listen to what--

794
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,821
- It's a very important story.
- Do you know what the story is?

795
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:03,723
- <i>I don't, but I know it's important.</i>
- How?

796
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:06,226
- Because Neal says it is.
<i>- And when you say it's important,</i>

797
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,961
what you really mean is that
it's more important than OWS.

798
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:11,164
- We apologize for anything--
- "We" don't apologize.

799
00:37:11,198 --> 00:37:12,766
- Many of us do.
- Bye.

800
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,003
Oh, Shelly, please take Neal to see
the guy in Zucotti Park.

801
00:37:16,037 --> 00:37:19,273
Let this serve as
electroshock therapy.

802
00:37:19,308 --> 00:37:21,142
Every time you want
to look down your nose at someone--

803
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:23,177
Maybe we're not the ones
who need therapy.

804
00:37:23,244 --> 00:37:25,079
Maybe your debilitating
persecution complex could be,

805
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:28,816
if not cured, then put in remission by
a team of Viennese specialists.

806
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,718
Anything else?

807
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,555
- Nope.
- Wait.

808
00:37:34,723 --> 00:37:36,691
I shouldn't have said
that last thing.

809
00:37:40,629 --> 00:37:42,930
Psst.

810
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:45,433
- Me?
- I'm killing it.

811
00:37:45,468 --> 00:37:47,468
You know why?

812
00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:50,571
Vassar.
Kaboom.

813
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:53,708
Sorry.

814
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:56,678
Can you make it fast?
'Cause I'm a little on fire.

815
00:37:56,713 --> 00:37:59,448
There's no signal
in the hallway.

816
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:01,116
Hey, Mac.

817
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,218
Just one second.
They're stepping out.

818
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:06,122
Taylor just called me.
Did you give away an interview with Romney?

819
00:38:08,492 --> 00:38:11,394
If you could give me just a second.
I don't have the room yet.

820
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:14,197
<i>You know exactly
how fucked up it is that you gave it away.</i>

821
00:38:14,232 --> 00:38:16,500
And that you gave it
to a girl you like.

822
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:18,902
It's not exactly like that,
but it was definitely wrong

823
00:38:18,936 --> 00:38:21,037
and I apologize
and I'll call Will.

824
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:22,739
- Don't call Will.
- If he finds out another way--

825
00:38:22,774 --> 00:38:25,509
I'll take that chance.
I don't know how to predict his behavior anymore.

826
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:26,977
Or yours.

827
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:29,045
And now I've got
to pull you off.

828
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,114
I understand.

829
00:38:31,148 --> 00:38:32,682
Well, you know, I don't.

830
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:35,285
Her boss--

831
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,934
Here are my notes.
You write it.

832
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:56,272
I caught Taylor in
an on-the-record moment I could trade

833
00:38:56,306 --> 00:38:58,173
and you were in trouble
with your boss.

834
00:38:58,208 --> 00:38:59,741
And, frankly,
I didn't like him.

835
00:38:59,776 --> 00:39:01,143
It must save you
a lot of time to be able

836
00:39:01,177 --> 00:39:03,344
- to reach that conclusion in 15 seconds.
- It does.

837
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:05,246
- But he happens to be a genius.
- Okay.

838
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:06,814
And either you don't know
or don't care

839
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:08,582
how insulting
your favor was to me,

840
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:10,284
but it's either
one or the other.

841
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:11,719
I'm experienced at this, Jim.

842
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:13,620
More experienced than you.

843
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,155
I got you on the bus.

844
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,123
And then, unbelievably,

845
00:39:17,158 --> 00:39:18,892
- you got us off the bus.
- Yeah.

846
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:21,594
Yeah, and since you don't know what the hell
you're talking about anyway,

847
00:39:21,629 --> 00:39:24,231
you shouldn't make
a giant assumption that is totally wrong

848
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:26,600
about my personal life
or my professional life.

849
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:28,235
Every-- Both of them.

850
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,003
It was the second one.
It was that I didn't care.

851
00:39:30,038 --> 00:39:31,371
- How insulting it was?
- Yeah.

852
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:33,273
'Cause but for a couple things
that I didn't foresee,

853
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:34,975
you wouldn't have found out.

854
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:36,276
What the hell?

855
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:38,746
Am I suddenly
a fucking receptacle

856
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,648
for every woman
who's pissed at a guy?

857
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:42,883
I did a fast calculation
and it was unlikely

858
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:45,252
he was gonna break news
or be interviewed on camera,

859
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:47,188
so I didn't think I was
robbing my network of much.

860
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:48,489
You didn't need it and I did?

861
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:50,257
In that call from your boss,
your--

862
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:52,059
- I don't know what to call him.
- Evan.

863
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,994
I've always--
I hate that name.

864
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:55,996
I did it because I wanted to.

865
00:39:56,031 --> 00:39:57,865
Everything about it felt right.

866
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:00,301
But if it was insulting,
I still don't care.

867
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:01,969
I'm going downstairs.

868
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,579
Yeah, I always hated
the name Evan, too.

869
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:21,456
<i>I'm talking about a plan.</i>

870
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:23,458
<i>This plan has come to symbolize</i>

871
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:25,794
<i>the struggle
for justice in India.</i>

872
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:29,298
Proponents claim
that it is urgently needed development.

873
00:40:29,332 --> 00:40:31,700
And opponents claim
that it will disrupt

874
00:40:31,735 --> 00:40:34,770
underprivileged communities
and service the wealthy few.

875
00:40:34,804 --> 00:40:37,105
What plan am I talking about?

876
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:40,809
<i>Narmada Dams!</i>

877
00:40:40,843 --> 00:40:43,011
Excuse me.

878
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:47,549
I'm right.
It's the Narmada Dams.

879
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:50,686
I can't believe what it takes
to get you to apologize.

880
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,288
I have absolutely no intention
of apologizing.

881
00:40:53,323 --> 00:40:54,823
<i>But you should enjoy me
while I'm here,</i>

882
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:57,059
'cause as soon as I leave,
so does the attention.

883
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:58,827
Your movement sucks, Shelly.

884
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:00,763
I'm sure it looks that way
from the outside.

885
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:02,665
And right there is your problem,
'cause who the fuck cares

886
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:04,233
what it looks like
from the inside?

887
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:07,202
Slavery, suffrage,
civil rights, Vietnam--

888
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:09,438
What all those things have in common
is there were leaders.

889
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:11,873
And the only thing the leaders cared about
was getting it done.

890
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:14,642
And if you guys had leaders
who could find a map with a fuckin' map,

891
00:41:14,676 --> 00:41:17,911
they'd tell you the thing about capitalism is
it's politically accountable.

892
00:41:17,946 --> 00:41:19,379
Did you watch my show tonight?

893
00:41:19,414 --> 00:41:21,582
Did you see anybody
courting the OWS vote?

894
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:23,984
'Cause all eight candidates
for the Republican nomination

895
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,453
said the words
"Tea Party" today

896
00:41:25,487 --> 00:41:27,555
in a bite they knew
would get picked up.

897
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:29,624
We're not trying
to get anyone elected.

898
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:32,426
We're just trying to point
so that people will look.

899
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:35,129
And you're looking at us
and not what we're pointing at.

900
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,335
I was terrible on the show.

901
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:43,104
I was embarrassed
in front of my friends

902
00:41:43,138 --> 00:41:45,206
and my students

903
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,442
and the people in my area
at Zucotti Park.

904
00:41:47,476 --> 00:41:50,878
If you had to slap me around,
couldn't we at least have talked about corruption,

905
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:52,914
financial crimes,

906
00:41:52,948 --> 00:41:54,916
predatory lending,
unlimited campaign donations?

907
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,184
You're not qualified
to talk about those things on our show.

908
00:41:57,219 --> 00:42:01,155
But, yes, I could talk about
those things more on our show.

909
00:42:02,724 --> 00:42:06,527
I slapped you around
to burnish my reputation as a moderate.

910
00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:09,630
You were a handy prop
and I'm sorry I embarrassed you.

911
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:12,833
I'm not smug.

912
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:15,536
I'm having a crisis
of confidence.

913
00:42:17,105 --> 00:42:19,706
That's a pretty
startling admission.

914
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:21,575
I don't have that many
people to talk to.

915
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:23,176
- That's ironic.
- I know.

916
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,811
- You're not married?
- No.

917
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,946
- Girlfriend?
- Well...

918
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:28,581
No.

919
00:42:28,616 --> 00:42:30,116
What was the "well"?

920
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,118
Hmm.

921
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:35,121
I'll take Neal to where
the guy usually is.

922
00:42:35,155 --> 00:42:37,290
- We found him already. We tracked him down.
- Are you for real?

923
00:42:37,324 --> 00:42:41,861
The interview was fun for me
and it shouldn't have been.

924
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:46,699
Well, you know what
my mother would say?

925
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:48,334
I absolutely do not.

926
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:50,336
Who are you really mad at?

927
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:52,038
You really want to tug
at that thread?

928
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:55,642
I wouldn't be surprised
if it has something to do with the "well."

929
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:00,047
Can I audit the rest
of your class?

930
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:03,150
- It's almost over.
- Perfect.

931
00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:04,919
<i>...as she sought exoneration</i>

932
00:43:04,953 --> 00:43:06,821
<i>in the murder of her college
roommate in Italy.</i>

933
00:43:06,856 --> 00:43:10,525
And tomorrow morning,
nearly four years after her initial detainment,

934
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:13,495
Amanda Knox will fly back
to her hometown of Seattle.

935
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:15,297
- Go.
- 77 up.

936
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:17,065
- Got that locked.
<i>- Ready 77.</i>

937
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,301
<i>...as the </i>Washington Post
<i>reported over the weekend</i>

938
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:22,003
<i>that Perry's family ranch,
where the presidential hopeful</i>

939
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:23,772
has hunted with his family
and friends

940
00:43:23,806 --> 00:43:26,375
and to which he has invited lawmakers,
has a name,

941
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:28,944
and that name is Niggerhead.

942
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:30,012
What the hell, fellas?!

943
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:31,613
- You want to take it?
- No.

944
00:43:31,648 --> 00:43:34,449
- All right, well, Elliot wrote the copy.
- Oh, fuck you.

945
00:43:34,484 --> 00:43:35,984
- You approved the copy.
- And I approved.

946
00:43:36,018 --> 00:43:38,019
I don't know how to tell the story
without saying the name.

947
00:43:38,086 --> 00:43:39,420
Bullshit.
You say the N-word.

948
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:41,322
N-wordhead Ranch?

949
00:43:41,356 --> 00:43:42,890
Something like that.
What did everybody else do?

950
00:43:42,924 --> 00:43:44,525
- They bit around it.
- Don Lemon said it.

951
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,027
- Don Lemon's black.
- Yeah, I don't know these rules.

952
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:48,995
The story is about the word
and we decided not to play

953
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,597
a game of Hangman
with the audience.

954
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:52,165
N-head Ranch?
Is there a G?

955
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:53,266
Shut up.

956
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:54,901
What if it said
Motherfucker on the rock?

957
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:56,569
It would be
a much different story

958
00:43:56,603 --> 00:43:58,371
and one a lot harder to
get to the bottom of.

959
00:43:58,405 --> 00:43:59,906
<i>Would you wait for me a minute?</i>

960
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,074
<i>Because that's how long
it's gonna take</i>

961
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:03,810
before Reese calls
saying that the Family Foundation

962
00:44:03,845 --> 00:44:05,445
for the Foundation of Families

963
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,314
is threatening to boycott
our advertisers

964
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:09,983
unless Elliot stops
being Jewish or something.

965
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:11,585
- Can I ask?
- What?

966
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:13,086
Other than that,
was it a good show?

967
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:15,055
- Get out.
- All right.

968
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:17,825
"Upon which was painted
a derogatory epithet for an African-American."

969
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:20,227
- I'm sorry, I nodded off while you were saying that.
- Get out!

970
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:26,401
- His name is Leon Deit.
- Deit?

971
00:44:26,435 --> 00:44:27,870
Rhymes with beet.

972
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:30,372
We've been interviewing
him for about an hour and 20 minutes

973
00:44:30,407 --> 00:44:32,107
and we're the first ones
who've spoken to him, though.

974
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:33,709
He doesn't know why we are.

975
00:44:33,744 --> 00:44:36,546
He was working for the Commission for Human
Rights in Conflict Zones

976
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,849
out of Islamabad
and they sent him to interview

977
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:41,451
<i>some people in Waziristan
who said they'd survived a raid</i>

978
00:44:41,485 --> 00:44:44,821
of what they say
were US military forces.

979
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:46,122
<i>He wrote this report.</i>

980
00:44:46,157 --> 00:44:49,092
He believes that as a result
of this report,

981
00:44:49,126 --> 00:44:51,027
his NGO was shut down.

982
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:54,063
Have you read it?

983
00:44:54,097 --> 00:44:57,866
Name some signs a person
would exhibit if they'd been exposed to sarin gas.

984
00:44:57,901 --> 00:45:00,603
Vomiting,
severe muscle twitches,

985
00:45:00,637 --> 00:45:03,139
and then death by choking
on their own vomit.

986
00:45:03,173 --> 00:45:06,142
Read what I've highlighted
on the third page.

987
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:10,847
"Villagers report
that many of the dead

988
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:14,652
seem to have aspirated
into their mouths...

989
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:19,223
and had been asphyxiated
by their own vomit."

990
00:45:44,113 --> 00:45:47,616
Was it absolutely necessary
for you to tell my boss?

991
00:45:48,752 --> 00:45:52,054
I wouldn't say
it was necessary,

992
00:45:52,088 --> 00:45:54,790
but it was what anyone
would do in my job.

993
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:57,226
And the reason
you don't know that

994
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,462
is because you've never
done this before.

995
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:03,466
You know,
we're doing this thing, Jim.

996
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,467
We're running for president.

997
00:46:05,502 --> 00:46:07,770
It's on.

998
00:46:07,804 --> 00:46:10,739
And it's a big, hard thing

999
00:46:10,774 --> 00:46:12,775
and we understand

1000
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:14,710
that we're gonna have to do it

1001
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:17,480
during a relentless onslaught

1002
00:46:17,514 --> 00:46:21,184
of absurd bullshit
from you and your friends.

1003
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:23,420
It was just my way
of saying that

1004
00:46:23,454 --> 00:46:25,956
we're gonna be around
for a while.

1005
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:28,525
Perry's done.

1006
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:30,961
It's not the ranch
that's gonna get him.

1007
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,631
It's his intellect.

1008
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,466
Not the world's worst reason

1009
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,835
for a Republican
candidate to lose.

1010
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,104
I wonder if anyone's
gonna notice that.

1011
00:46:42,474 --> 00:46:45,777
I know I'm gonna see you
somewhere again before November.

1012
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:48,246
Take it easy.

1013
00:46:50,082 --> 00:46:51,883
Take it easy, Taylor.

1014
00:46:56,822 --> 00:46:59,991
You were lying before.

1015
00:47:01,327 --> 00:47:03,762
About the fast
calculation you did.

1016
00:47:05,231 --> 00:47:07,265
It was a big deal.

1017
00:47:09,736 --> 00:47:11,937
I think you got in trouble.

1018
00:47:16,943 --> 00:47:19,111
You have to go back
to New York.

1019
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:24,350
Yeah.

1020
00:47:27,086 --> 00:47:30,022
Well,

1021
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,458
I don't like that.

1022
00:47:37,164 --> 00:47:39,332
It's all right
'cause I--

1023
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:49,210
I'm the rebound.

1024
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:51,412
And I went to Vassar.

1025
00:47:53,182 --> 00:47:56,218
I think that Vassar has
a really strong hold on you

1026
00:47:56,252 --> 00:47:59,555
'cause you seem to
have a lot of anxiety about living up--

1027
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,235
What-- I should have
asked this an hour ago--

1028
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,936
Are we counting as messed up?

1029
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:18,806
<i>What do I--
Here's what I'm asking.</i>

1030
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,509
What do I have to look like
for my testimony

1031
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:25,746
about the interview with General Stomtonovich
to not be discounted?

1032
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,381
The way you look right now.

1033
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:29,383
Just the facts, ma'am.

1034
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,854
We slept over at the orphanage.

1035
00:48:33,889 --> 00:48:36,690
Sometime--
I didn't look at my watch,

1036
00:48:36,724 --> 00:48:39,793
but the police report
said it was sometime after midnight--

1037
00:48:39,828 --> 00:48:42,863
- We heard some--
- I heard. Don't say we.

1038
00:48:44,165 --> 00:48:47,068
I heard a popping sound
in the distance.

1039
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:49,437
Maybe 100 yards away.

1040
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:51,506
Pop, pop.

1041
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,494
Pop, pop.

1042
00:49:26,912 --> 00:49:28,946
What are they saying?

1043
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:30,815
It's Lugisu.

1044
00:49:33,752 --> 00:49:35,319
There were gunshots.

1045
00:49:37,823 --> 00:49:39,590
Do you know Lugisu?

1046
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:41,559
No.

1047
00:49:43,762 --> 00:49:45,930
Not in front of the kids.

1048
00:50:16,461 --> 00:50:18,761
Pastor Moses's wife Kissa

1049
00:50:18,796 --> 00:50:21,798
started quietly waking the kids
and keeping them calm,

1050
00:50:21,832 --> 00:50:23,633
making sure they didn't scream.

1051
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:26,202
But then we heard another

1052
00:50:26,237 --> 00:50:28,939
pop, pop, pop.

1053
00:50:28,973 --> 00:50:30,874
Shh.

1054
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:32,776
<i>What is happening?</i>

1055
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,046
<i>It's okay, child.</i>

1056
00:50:37,415 --> 00:50:39,983
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1057
00:51:00,772 --> 00:51:03,974
Ronald was trying to tell them
that this was an orphanage

1058
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,242
and there wasn't any cattle.

1059
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:07,711
But he was doing it in Luganda.

1060
00:51:21,688 --> 00:51:23,828
Ronald and Gary
flew back inside.

1061
00:51:23,863 --> 00:51:25,530
Get the children
on the bus right now.

1062
00:51:25,564 --> 00:51:29,100
<i>Out the back on the bus,
head below the windows.</i>

1063
00:51:29,135 --> 00:51:31,703
Where are we going?

1064
00:51:33,405 --> 00:51:36,774
We got the kids out the back door
and on the bus.

1065
00:51:36,808 --> 00:51:38,643
Seven, eight, nine,

1066
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:41,513
10, 11,

1067
00:51:41,547 --> 00:51:44,382
12...

1068
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,984
13, 14...

1069
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:49,220
And Pastor Moses
did a head count.

1070
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:51,957
Daniel?

1071
00:51:53,392 --> 00:51:55,527
Daniel?

1072
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,700
What...

1073
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:04,103
He was under my bed.

1074
00:52:04,137 --> 00:52:06,072
Daniel.

1075
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:09,241
Come on.
We've got to go to the bus.

1076
00:52:09,275 --> 00:52:10,776
Daniel, please.

1077
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:13,345
Come on, Daniel.
Please, come on.

1078
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,149
The frame was maybe
six inches off the ground.

1079
00:52:16,183 --> 00:52:18,118
<i>I don't know how
he got under there.</i>

1080
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:21,687
It's bolted to the floor.

1081
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:24,490
<i>Daniel, come on.</i>

1082
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:29,229
No, not the front.

1083
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:32,933
Daniel.

1084
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:37,804
Come on, Daniel.

1085
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,842
Get back.

1086
00:52:41,876 --> 00:52:43,243
Be careful.

1087
00:52:51,285 --> 00:52:53,253
<i>Come on, Daniel.
Come on.</i>

1088
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:55,655
Come on.
Come on, Daniel.

1089
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,624
Come on.

1090
00:52:57,659 --> 00:52:59,459
Okay. Okay.

1091
00:52:59,494 --> 00:53:02,262
No, come on.
Here, get on my back.

1092
00:53:02,296 --> 00:53:04,564
Grab on here.
Okay.

1093
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:17,477
They speak 1,944 languages
in Africa.

1094
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:19,645
I've learned
some Luganda phrases,

1095
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,481
but I didn't know any Lugisu.

1096
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:24,350
I don't know where
the cattle bandits were from,

1097
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:26,486
so once I got home,
it took me a while

1098
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,622
to translate what
they'd been shouting.

1099
00:53:29,657 --> 00:53:32,392
It was
"Give us the camera."

1100
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,285
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1101
00:54:13,504 --> 00:54:14,905
<i>Again.</i>

1102
00:54:14,939 --> 00:54:16,840
<i>All right.</i>

1103
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:20,511
"This is the house.

1104
00:54:20,545 --> 00:54:22,746
The house on East 88th Street.

1105
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:24,348
Mr. and Mrs. Primm--"

1106
00:54:25,517 --> 00:54:27,251
He died right away?

1107
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:30,320
Yeah.

1108
00:54:35,793 --> 00:54:37,761
Oh, God.

1109
00:54:39,531 --> 00:54:42,232
Okay. Okay.

1110
00:54:42,267 --> 00:54:43,667
I can't find a pulse.

1111
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:45,702
His pupils are dilated.

1112
00:54:45,736 --> 00:54:47,403
<i>There's no pulse.</i>

1113
00:54:56,347 --> 00:54:59,583
Yeah, the hospital said
the bullet hit his spine.

1114
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:10,660
And that's it?

1115
00:55:10,694 --> 00:55:11,928
That is it.

1116
00:55:11,962 --> 00:55:13,896
We never got to Kampala.

1117
00:55:13,931 --> 00:55:17,433
The company brought us back
'cause we had to be debriefed by HR.

1118
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:22,105
<i>Jim Harper, under oath,</i>

1119
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:24,407
<i>is gonna testify
to your state of mind.</i>

1120
00:55:24,441 --> 00:55:26,442
<i>Is there anything
he'll be asked about?</i>

1121
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:31,080
Maggie?

1122
00:55:33,384 --> 00:55:35,585
You're back.

1123
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,188
I read the HR report.

1124
00:55:43,194 --> 00:55:45,695
There's honestly
nothing to ask about.

1125
00:55:45,729 --> 00:55:48,364
It was upsetting.
I don't want to minimize it, but--

1126
00:55:48,399 --> 00:55:50,399
- Were you sent to a doctor?
<i>- By HR.</i>

1127
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:52,601
- A psychiatrist?
- Yeah, and I'm fine.

1128
00:55:52,636 --> 00:55:55,104
The doctor prescribed Paxil,
but I don't take it.

1129
00:55:55,138 --> 00:55:57,473
- <i>You don't?</i>
- No.

1130
00:55:57,508 --> 00:55:59,542
A psychiatrist examined you

1131
00:55:59,576 --> 00:56:02,645
and prescribed a very strong psychotropic
that you're not taking?

1132
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,781
I don't need it.

1133
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:07,517
Oh, God, Maggie.
That's a terrible answer.

1134
00:56:07,552 --> 00:56:11,154
I was there.
It was Stomtonovich, Jerry, and me.

1135
00:56:11,189 --> 00:56:13,623
- He never said, "It happened."
- He said that you were in no--

1136
00:56:13,658 --> 00:56:16,192
They were there 'cause they spotted us
filming the engineers

1137
00:56:16,227 --> 00:56:18,061
and I pulled him out
from under the bed forcibly

1138
00:56:18,095 --> 00:56:20,897
and his spine ended up stopping a bullet
that was plainly gonna hit me,

1139
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:24,300
so it's obviously something
I'm gonna remember, but...

1140
00:56:24,335 --> 00:56:26,669
you know...

1141
00:56:26,704 --> 00:56:28,638
What do you want?

1142
00:56:36,213 --> 00:56:39,414
He didn't say it.
I can testify to that.

1143
00:56:39,449 --> 00:56:41,616
I'm fine.

1144
00:56:48,657 --> 00:56:49,957
<i>"There was little they could do,</i>

1145
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,692
<i>at least for the moment,</i>

1146
00:56:51,726 --> 00:56:53,860
to prevent Mr. Grumps
from putting Lyle in the zoo."

1147
00:56:53,895 --> 00:56:56,996
He's never seen
hair like yours.

1148
00:56:57,031 --> 00:56:59,098
That color is called blonde,
Daniel,

1149
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:02,401
and it's nothing but trouble.
