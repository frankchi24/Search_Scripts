1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,620
It happened, Jim.

2
00:00:01,644 --> 00:00:03,992
- Charlie, be the voice of reason.
- I think it happened,

3
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:07,867
and I think we're two inches
away from proving it.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,098
We have 30 names,

5
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:11,847
and these were given to us
by Sweeney.

6
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:13,508
<i>None of them is talking,
with the exception of</i>

7
00:00:13,532 --> 00:00:15,739
<i>Lance Corporal Herman Valenzuela,
who is dead.</i>

8
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:17,030
General Stomtonovich?

9
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:18,768
You want to know how
chemical weapons are stored?

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,330
- Yes.
- Come in.

11
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,582
I'm asking you
if we used sarin gas.

12
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:25,460
- <i>If</i> we used sarin--
- General--

13
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,773
Listen to me.
Here's how.

14
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:30,514
<i>If</i> we used sarin.

15
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:33,009
<i>If</i> we used sarin.

16
00:00:33,026 --> 00:00:34,882
<i>Did we use sarin gas?</i>

17
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:36,408
We used sarin.

18
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:38,820
- We're not there yet.
- How long before you're comfortable?

19
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:41,133
Lance Corporal Herman Valenzuela
is on the phone.

20
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,485
- Valenzuela's dead.
- No, he's not. He is on the phone.

21

22
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:10,055
I need some kind
of sign from you.

23
00:02:10,156 --> 00:02:13,225
I need an indication,
some kind of indication, that you--

24
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:16,227
- What?
- Fully understand the stupidity of this.

25
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:18,262
- I do.
- Doesn't feel like it.

26
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:20,298
How would you
like me to behave?

27
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,533
It feels to me--
I have to say,

28
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,368
it feels to me like
you think this is nuance,

29
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:26,370
that you think there are layers
that have to be explored.

30
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:29,840
- Why do you say that?
<i>- For one thing, there's four lawyers in the room</i>

31
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,541
billing out at, I don't know.

32
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:33,043
I'm sure you're worth it.

33
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:35,445
And you've been here five days.
This is your fifth day.

34
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:38,148
But that's my point.
Why do we need lawyers who are worth it?

35
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:40,984
Why do we need lawyers?
Why do <i>we</i> need lawyers?

36
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:43,519
- You're being sued.
- And you're saying that like it's not insane.

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,655
You're saying that
like it isn't--

38
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:51,126
Tell me what I'm missing.

39
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:53,028
A producer comes up from DC.

40
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:55,364
He wants to make a name
for himself in New York.

41
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:56,731
He chases a story
that's not there.

42
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,867
And the story,
it's not a kitten up a tree.

43
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:02,204
Chemical weapons,
sarin gas on civilians.

44
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:06,007
He cooks an interview.
He takes a pair of scissors to raw footage.

45
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:07,509
Of a man on the street?

46
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,044
Of a retired,
three-star Marine general.

47
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:13,114
We go to air.
48 hours it takes for the story to come undone

48
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:14,516
and with it
Atlantis Cable News.

49
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:16,317
ANC is brought to its knees.

50
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:19,520
The producer's surgical strike is discovered
and the producer is fired.

51
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:21,254
Does he write an open letter
to the <i>New York Times</i>

52
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:22,923
apologizing to the public,
his colleagues,

53
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,992
the three-star general,
and the US Armed Forces?

54
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:27,928
No, he sues us
for wrongful termination.

55
00:03:28,029 --> 00:03:30,664
And I need to know,
I need some kind of sign from you, Rebecca,

56
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:32,232
because you're obviously--
All four of you,

57
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,501
you can't be stupid
and afford haircuts this good.

58
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:38,004
I need you to tell me
that this is exactly as insane as it is.

59
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:40,540
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to infuriate you.

60
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:43,209
- Why?
- Because it is nuanced.

61
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,178
He cooked an interview.
He took pruning shears to the raw--

62
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:49,215
Rebecca,
if he doused the studio in kerosene

63
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:51,950
and lit a tiki torch, it wouldn't have done
as much damage as Genoa,

64
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:54,720
so where is the complexity?
Where is the nuance?

65
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,789
His claim is he's a scapegoat.

66
00:03:57,891 --> 00:03:59,591
- That's his claim?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:02,761
I understand why he'd feel that way,
because it was entirely his fault.

68
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:05,731
And if it was entirely his fault,
then it's not at all anyone else's.

69
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:07,264
It was not at all
anyone else's.

70
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,866
That's where
the plaintiff disagrees.

71
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:11,235
And if Dantana was being offered
as a sacrifice to the gods...

72
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:14,071
- Oh, Rebecca.
- ...and it was an institutional failure

73
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,040
- <i>that led to the airing of Genoa...</i>
- I'm gonna eat this table.

74
00:04:16,141 --> 00:04:19,644
and he is paying the price for mistakes
that were made above him.

75
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:22,112
This isn't
an original story, Don.

76
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,648
- He cooked--
- That's the nuance.

77
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:27,684
The nuance is he's gonna
leverage the public's inexhaustible love

78
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,019
of big shots falling down.

79
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:31,387
Charlie, Will, and Mac.

80
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,856
I know how this ends.

81
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:36,292
Why is it called a red team?

82
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,765
- The blood cells.
- Hmm?

83
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,133
White blood cells attack an infection,
red blood cells clean it up.

84
00:04:45,234 --> 00:04:47,736
You have a group of people investigating a story,
they're the white team.

85
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:49,738
Other people are purposely
kept out of the loop

86
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,540
so that when the white team is ready,
they can--

87
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,442
- Fresh eyes.
- We're supposed to poke holes in it.

88
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,309
- <i>And were you able to?</i>
- Were we...

89
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,379
The first red team.
You...

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,682
Jim Harper, Sloan Sabbith.

91
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:03,284
Was anyone able
to poke holes in it?

92
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:06,120
No. Other than the made-up interview,
it was a solid story.

93
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,822
I'm asking if you were
able to poke holes in it.

94
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:09,523
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
What does it matter?

95
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,158
It matters.
It matters because

96
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,827
there were holes in the story,
right?

97
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:16,096
- Yeah.
- Now, Don, a ton of them, right?

98
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:18,065
- We didn't see the holes because--
- Ah!

99
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:21,267
That's institutional failure,
right?

100
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:24,972
You don't have to answer that.

101
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,839
- In fact, don't.
- I can.

102
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,976
First red team meeting
was seven months ago.

103
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:31,611
Charlie wants more evidence.

104
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:34,546
Second red team meeting,
you have Stomtonovich now.

105
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,116
- Charlie still wants more evidence.
- That's not diligent?

106
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:39,184
Third red team meeting,
you have Valenzuela now

107
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:40,953
and Charlie
green-lights Genoa.

108
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,554
And I'm asking you,
other than the cooked tape, Mrs. Lincoln,

109
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:45,556
were there any holes
in the story?

110
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:48,994
- Yes.
- But you didn't find any of them.

111
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,462
We found all of them.
And I grant you

112
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:53,264
it would've been better if we found them
before the story aired.

113
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:56,101
- You'll grant me that.
- He digitally remastered an interview.

114
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,802
That is the all of it.
That's it.

115
00:05:57,903 --> 00:06:00,170
There was no
institutional failure.

116
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:01,839
<i>Where was the third
red team meeting?</i>

117
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,374
Where did Charlie
give the green light?

118
00:06:05,376 --> 00:06:06,877
It was right in this room.

119
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:10,247
This is an interview
with Gunnery Sergeant Eric Sweeney,

120
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:13,283
the first member of the Genoa crew
to come forward.

121
00:06:13,384 --> 00:06:15,384
It was recorded
in September of last year.

122
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,787
The third red team meeting,
red team three,

123
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:20,356
we were all walked through
the evidence again.

124
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:23,225
One: Jerry gets a tip
from Cyrus West,

125
00:06:23,326 --> 00:06:25,828
a retired Air Force captain
who had just appeared on <i>News Night</i>

126
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:27,096
in support of drone strikes.

127
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:29,899
Cyrus West is known
among people I know

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,068
- as a guy with ambition.
- What kind of ambition?

129
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:35,603
Congress, <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>,
I don't know.

130
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,572
But you have to take
what he said with a salt lick.

131
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,407
Did you warn anyone about that?

132
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:41,710
I couldn't.
I wasn't in the loop.

133
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,278
You also weren't in New York.

134
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,714
I was in New Hampshire
with the Romney campaign at the time.

135
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,215
- Why?
- I was covering for our embed,

136
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:50,051
a guy named Ben Furusho
who'd hurt himself.

137
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:51,552
- How'd he hurt himself?
<i>- Ben?</i>

138
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:53,520
- Yeah.
- Mark is asking did he hurt himself

139
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,389
saving people from
a burning building?

140
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,725
No, he got drunk
and tried to jump

141
00:06:57,826 --> 00:07:00,661
from his second-floor balcony into the pool
at the Nashua Holiday Inn.

142
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:02,929
Were you the only one
available to cover for him?

143
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,430
No.

144
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:06,700
Were you the only one
qualified to cover for him?

145
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,769
- No.
- Who made the decision you should cover for him?

146
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,238
- I did.
<i>- You sent yourself to New Hampshire?</i>

147
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,808
I think you know what
these guys are getting at.

148
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:20,779
There is a woman
I work with--

149
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,083
Maggie Jordan.
We don't have to make this excruciating.

150
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:25,951
You had a relationship
with a coworker.

151
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:28,520
- It wasn't a relationship.
- You had something with Maggie,

152
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:30,689
but she was living with Don
and your heart was a little dinged up,

153
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,290
so you wanted to get
out of town for a while

154
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:33,992
and that's why you weren't
available to do your job,

155
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:36,060
which at that moment
included saying to MacKenzie,

156
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:38,329
"Don't trust Cyrus West."

157
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,064
What is it Jerry's counting on?

158
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:42,266
That you guys don't want stories
like that made public.

159
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:43,601
Go back to red team three.

160
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:45,536
Genoa got on the air
because I was distracted?

161
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:48,539
Go back.

162
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,974
One: Jerry gets the tip
from Cyrus West.

163
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,610
The tip leads him to Eric Sweeney.
That's two.

164
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,478
Here's the Sweeney interview.

165
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:58,081
<i>Would you say your name,
rank, and your last billet?</i>

166
00:07:58,182 --> 00:07:59,983
Gunnery Sergeant Eric Sweeney.

167
00:08:00,084 --> 00:08:03,120
<i>Before my discharge,
I was stationed with a MARSOC unit in J-bad.</i>

168
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:05,222
<i>That's Marine
Special Operations Command</i>

169
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:07,256
- <i>in Jalalabad?</i>
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

170
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:10,192
<i>Have you ever heard
of a black op called Genoa?</i>

171
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:13,929
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Did you participate in that black op?</i>

172
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,900
This was maybe the hundredth time
I'd seen the Sweeney interview.

173
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:20,770
Intel had location
on two Marine POWs

174
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,271
who'd been separated from
their unit three days earlier

175
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:25,439
during a firefight
in the Hindu Kush.

176
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,909
They'd been smuggled
across the border

177
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,844
and the Pakistani Taliban
intended to sell them

178
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:31,345
for propaganda purposes.

179
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:33,581
What does "propaganda
purposes" mean?

180
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:35,516
They were gonna be
publicly beheaded.

181
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:37,585
And if we didn't get them before
they were moved again, we'd lose them.

182
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:39,386
Operation Genoa
was an extraction.

183
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:41,621
A MARSOC unit flies in
on a couple of Black Hawks

184
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:44,457
and grabs our guys,
but the first unit was overrun

185
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:47,527
and the second unit,
the story goes,

186
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,428
dropped sarin gas.

187
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,130
Suddenly I'm tripping
over people screaming.

188
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,632
Boils and burns on their bodies.
Some of them passed out.

189
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,367
<i>What did you think
was in the missile?</i>

190
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,836
I wasn't sure,
but I didn't have time

191
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,404
to think about it
until we were out of there.

192
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,605
So later I'm talking
to the crew,

193
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:00,973
I'm asking about
the weapons package.

194
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,474
Why'd the white
phosphorus do that?

195
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,942
And the guy said
it wasn't the Willie Pete.

196
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,245
I said, "What was it?"
He said, "Sarin."

197
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,448
<i>Will was the only one in the room
who hadn't heard the story before.</i>

198
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,518
I looked over to see
what his first reaction was going to be.

199
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,153
<i>The guy said
it wasn't the Willie Pete.</i>

200
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,089
<i>I said, "What was it?"
He said, "Sarin."</i>

201
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,958
<i>There was no expression.</i>

202
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,560
Cyrus West, Eric Sweeney,
that's one and two.

203
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:25,662
<i>The tweets from Hamni8 were three.</i>

204
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:27,998
<i>Four was Leon Deit
and the NGO report.</i>

205
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:31,735
Five was Charlie's source
who handed over the helo manifest.

206
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,504
<i>This is a list of every weapon
the Black Hawks were carrying,</i>

207
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:36,672
or at least
one of the two Black Hawks.

208
00:09:36,773 --> 00:09:38,441
MX-76.

209
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:41,777
Five munitions experts
say there's no such thing.

210
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,181
It's what you write in that spot
when your payload is codeword-classified.

211
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:46,682
That's the sarin.

212
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:48,784
Charlie's source
was our fifth piece of evidence.

213
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,854
Were you happy
with the evidence so far?

214
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,589
- Was I?
- Yeah.

215
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:56,792
Rebecca, I run our website.

216
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:58,394
I'm not
an investigative reporter.

217
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,996
Yeah, I'm just asking how you felt
about the evidence so far.

218
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:05,768
- I'm not qualified to judge the evidence.
- You were on the Genoa team?

219
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:07,536
- Yeah.
- You were put on the team?

220
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:08,570
- Yes. Yes.
- Neal.

221
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:09,871
Don't ever fucking say out loud

222
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:11,706
that you are unqualified
to judge the evidence.

223
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:12,940
- Wait--
- Don't ever say it again.

224
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,410
I was absolutely qualified
to chase the Hamni8 tweets,

225
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:17,412
- which was my job on the team.
- I get that.

226
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:19,414
You get that.
They get that.

227
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:21,549
Let's quit while we're ahead.

228
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,518
Five was Charlie's source
with the helo manifest.

229
00:10:24,619 --> 00:10:26,487
Six was Stomtonovich.

230
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:29,556
<i>At the time of Genoa,
we still had sarin gas. Is that right?</i>

231
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:31,692
<i>- Yes, we did.</i>
<i>- You're sure of this?</i>

232
00:10:31,793 --> 00:10:35,729
We had sarin gas at the time of Genoa
and we have sarin today.

233
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,265
<i>According to the OPCW,
the US was scheduled</i>

234
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:41,534
<i>to have completed its destruction
of chemical weapons by 2007.</i>

235
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,836
- The US missed that deadline.
- Stop the tape.

236
00:10:46,507 --> 00:10:48,240
What are we gonna do
about the basketball game?

237
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:51,477
- We'll blur it out.
- Why was the interview conducted in front of a game?

238
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:54,781
- He wanted it on.
- Why not move his chair?

239
00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:56,815
I wanted the Marine
paraphernalia in the shot,

240
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,683
but to get that,
I couldn't frame out the screen,

241
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,286
which I knew I could take out later.
Is this important?

242
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,792
<i>Still no reaction from Will.</i>

243
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,561
Stomtonovich was six
and then Valenzuela was seven.

244
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:12,496
I conducted the interview with Lance
Corporal Herman Valenzuela

245
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:15,232
on August 22,
the day before yesterday.

246
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,234
Here it is.

247
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,503
<i>Did you use gas on the mission?</i>

248
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:22,440
Valenzuela,
the crew chief on board

249
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,408
one of the two MARSOC helos,
confirms everything

250
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:27,110
we've been told by West,
Sweeney, and Stomtonovich,

251
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:30,212
all of which is consistent
with the tweets from Hamni8,

252
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,416
the Leon Deit report,
and Charlie's source with the helo manifest.

253
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:35,251
The presentation is over

254
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:37,487
and Will's just heard
everything for the first time.

255
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:40,957
This is what's been happening
for the last 11 months.

256
00:11:41,058 --> 00:11:43,326
Yeah, I had a hunch.

257
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:45,961
You did?

258
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:50,899
I heard the same story.

259
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:57,706
<i>That came as kind of
a shock to everybody.</i>

260
00:11:57,807 --> 00:12:00,508
Like Charlie's source,
Will was only able to identify

261
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:03,043
him or her as reliable
and in a position to know.

262
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:06,080
- At that moment--
- I know what you're gonna ask and it doesn't matter.

263
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:08,415
Sloan, at that moment,
did anyone in the room--

264
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,685
You've got everyone--
You've got the president of the news division,

265
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:13,488
the editor and anchor in chief,
the EP,

266
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:15,289
- senior producer, staff.
- It didn't matter.

267
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,624
Did anyone at that moment
think to ask

268
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,627
if Charlie's source and Will's source
were the same person?

269
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,963
It didn't matter.

270
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,364
- Did anyone--
- It was already a go.

271
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:25,866
Will's source was just extra.

272
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,767
It didn't make you feel
more confident

273
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:29,736
that Will had heard it too?

274
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:34,406
- Yes.
- Did anyone ask?

275
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:36,475
No.

276
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:41,246
How many more times
did you review the evidence?

277
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:43,015
I'm not sure.

278
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:45,651
We went through the whole thing
maybe four more times.

279
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:47,653
I'm ready to say go.

280
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:49,687
You know how I feel.

281
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:51,188
- I'm convinced.
<i>- I'm not.</i>

282
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:52,189
- I know.
- Mac.

283
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,791
Tell me why.

284
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,094
It just doesn't feel right.

285
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:58,930
11 months of reporting
versus your gut?

286
00:12:59,031 --> 00:13:00,097
I'll take the reporting.

287
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:02,466
- I'd take Jim's gut.
- Me, too.

288
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:04,735
You worship at the altar
of logic and reason.

289
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:07,838
And I don't believe this many people
could keep something like this a secret.

290
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,773
- Well, they didn't.
- Jerry, I know these guys.

291
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:12,643
All due respect, Jim,
but you fetishize these guys.

292
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,845
<i>Two million men and women
in the armed services.</i>

293
00:13:14,946 --> 00:13:16,479
<i>You were embedded
with a couple of units.</i>

294
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:18,415
- You know a few these guys.
- Hang on.

295
00:13:18,516 --> 00:13:20,517
I don't think it's fetishizing
to admire people

296
00:13:20,617 --> 00:13:22,785
who signed up to fight
a couple of wars that neither one of us

297
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,354
<i>wanted to dirty our hands with,
but I do give them the benefit of the doubt.</i>

298
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:27,590
I gave them the benefit of the doubt,
too, until I saw pictures

299
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:30,860
of what's-her-name doing the "get this" pose
next to prisoners in dog collars

300
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:34,096
wired to car batteries.
It doesn't feel right?

301
00:13:34,197 --> 00:13:37,331
We've tortured, drowned, wiretapped,
renditioned, and suspended due process,

302
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:40,068
but you think we drew a moral
and legal line someplace?

303
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:41,736
- Are you one of the Andrews Sisters?
- All right.

304
00:13:41,837 --> 00:13:43,438
It doesn't
feel right because--

305
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,640
It doesn't feel right
because I was the one leading the team.

306
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,141
I'm sure that's not
what Jim was gonna say.

307
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:48,677
No, it's exactly
what I was going to say.

308
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:50,645
What's your concern with me?

309
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,447
- My concern is that I don't know you.
- Well, that's a lame reason.

310
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:56,216
No, right now he's being
paid to be skeptical.

311
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:57,718
<i>I didn't show up one day.</i>

312
00:13:57,819 --> 00:13:59,987
I've been working at the DC bureau
for eight years.

313
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,623
We may be the ugly stepsister,
but it worked for you, too, Charlie.

314
00:14:02,724 --> 00:14:04,825
<i>- Don.</i>
- When Jim doesn't feel good about a story,

315
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,660
I take it seriously.

316
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:09,228
But I have another concern
which Mac and I talked about last March.

317
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:11,530
- Do you remember this?
- Yeah. Safety.

318
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:13,365
Isn't there a chance
we're putting soldiers in danger?

319
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:14,867
- Yes.
- Even rioting.

320
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:16,970
Plus the "get this" pictures
with the dog collars

321
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:19,706
was the single best recruiting tool
Al-Qaeda's ever had.

322
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:22,809
You're saying don't run a story
about the use of chemical weapons

323
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,776
- because it might be dangerous?
- I am.

324
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:26,979
But the chemical weapons,
they're not dangerous?

325
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,815
- I'm saying the needs of the many--
- It's the protests that we should be worried about?

326
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,050
I also think we should consider
there's an election going on.

327
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:33,885
You think we shouldn't run it
until after November?

328
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:35,520
I think we should wait
until we're sure.

329
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:37,355
We are sure.
You just don't like the story.

330
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,691
"It is illegal to develop,
produce,

331
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,760
otherwise acquire,
transfer directly or indirectly,

332
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:46,130
receive, stockpile, retain,
own, possess, or use

333
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:48,733
or threaten to use
any chemical weapon.

334
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:52,003
Any person who violates
section 229 of this title

335
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:54,505
and by whose action the death
of another person is the result

336
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:57,473
shall be punished by death
or imprisoned for life."

337
00:14:57,574 --> 00:15:00,710
That's not the Geneva Conventions,
that's US federal law.

338
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:02,979
Whose case are you arguing?

339
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,716
I'm just making sure we know
what we're accusing these guys of.

340
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:09,986
Who, by the way,
rescued two Marines while taking heavy fire.

341
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:11,855
If these guys are charged,
there could be riots here at home, too.

342
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:14,757
- God, Don, just stay in your house.
- Okay.

343
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:22,698
Will?

344
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:28,070
He sat there a long time
before he said...

345
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,013
I trust Charlie and Mac.

346
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:40,982
All right, we're going.

347
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,084
Lock it down.

348
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,490
<i>- 15 seconds.
- Stand by roll-in.</i>

349
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:51,692
- Stand by.
- Standing.

350
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,259
- G118.
- Standing.

351
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,328
- Ready roll-in.
- Here we go, Will.

352
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,530
And roll in.

353
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:09,809
We've been at war
with Al-Qaeda and its allies

354
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,976
for over 10 years.

355
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:12,945
War demands sacrifice--

356
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:15,380
Sometimes of liberty,
sometimes of livelihood,

357
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:17,082
and sometimes of life.

358
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:19,450
But does it require us
to abandon the principles

359
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:23,521
for which we're fighting
and inch by inch resemble more the enemy we fight?

360
00:16:23,622 --> 00:16:26,591
As Alfred Adler once said,
"It is easier to fight

361
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:28,659
for one's principles
than to live up to them."

362
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,561
This is <i>ACN Reports</i> and tonight

363
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:32,730
we tell you the story
of Operation Genoa,

364
00:16:32,831 --> 00:16:35,632
a made-for-Hollywood tale
of a daring rescue mission.

365
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:38,602
It's to you to decide
if the mission was a success.

366
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:42,072
<i>Our report begins with a firefight
in Afghanistan's Hindu Kush</i>

367
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:44,541
<i>that separated two Marines
from their pinned-down unit.</i>

368
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:46,043
<i>Go three.</i>

369
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:47,544
<i>The mountains of the Hindu Kush</i>

370
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:49,045
<i>have been violent tribal areas</i>

371
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:50,947
<i>since before
Alexander the Great</i>

372
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:53,449
<i>marched through Persia
on his way to India.</i>

373
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,318
<i>On one dangerous night
in March 2009,</i>

374
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,087
<i>two young Marines
were on patrol...</i>

375
00:16:58,188 --> 00:17:01,390
...intelligence they were gonna be smuggled
across the border by Pakistani Taliban.

376
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:03,726
- And what else did the intelligence tell you?
- There was a ticking clock.

377
00:17:03,827 --> 00:17:05,761
We knew they were gonna be sold
for propaganda purposes.

378
00:17:05,862 --> 00:17:07,495
- Sold to Al-Qaeda?
- Yes.

379
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:08,997
- <i>In a matter of days?</i>
- Hours, really.

380
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,498
According to the Organization

381
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,267
for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons...

382
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:15,336
<i>- Ready 17.
- Stand by 19 through 22A.</i>

383
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:16,905
Standing.

384
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:19,374
But we sat down with
a Marine three-star general,

385
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:22,943
<i>an expert in chemical weapons
with knowledge of Operation Genoa.</i>

386
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,246
At his request,
we blacked out his face

387
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,381
- and electronically altered his voice.
- Go 17.

388
00:17:27,482 --> 00:17:29,150
<i>According to the OPCW,</i>

389
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,551
<i>the US was scheduled to have
completed its destruction</i>

390
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:33,320
<i>of chemical weapons by 2007.</i>

391
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:35,289
<i>The US missed that deadline.</i>

392
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,892
<i>They extended it to 2012
and they missed that deadline, too.</i>

393
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:41,995
At the time of Genoa,
we destroyed at least 87%...

394
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:45,165
We asked if any exceptional measures
were used in the operation.

395
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:48,268
<i>Exceptional measures
were called for.</i>

396
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:51,805
<i>We asked if sarin gas was used.</i>

397
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:54,072
We used sarin.

398
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,575
<i>A crew chief from
the operation speaks to us</i>

399
00:17:56,677 --> 00:18:00,379
when <i>ACN Reports</i> returns
right after this.

400
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:18,530
What are your duties
as crew chief?

401
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,665
I'm in charge of the crew
and the equipment.

402
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,335
Do you oversee the loading
of the helicopter, the payload?

403
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,037
Yes, during preflight,
I'd be responsible for the payload.

404
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:08,141
...being roughly
7,500 tons of sarin.

405
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:11,044
The Pentagon declined
our request for an interview.

406
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:14,014
For everyone at <i>ACN Reports</i>,
I'm Will McAvoy.

407
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:15,949
Good night.

408
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:24,023
Are you here for a call?

409
00:19:24,124 --> 00:19:25,825
Congratulations?

410
00:19:25,926 --> 00:19:29,195
General Stomtonovich.
Charlie, he's screaming.

411
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:37,068
- He says he never said they used sarin.
- It's on film.

412
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,938
- He says he never said that.
- It's on film.

413
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,441
- I knew this would happen.
- It happens all the time.

414
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:45,878
These guys get cold feet
or someone at the DOD begs them to recant.

415
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,380
- What's he saying we did?
- Edited him out of context.

416
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:50,416
- Did you tell him we have the raw footage?
- Yeah.

417
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,417
Raw footage isn't edited
out of context.

418
00:19:52,518 --> 00:19:54,285
- It isn't edited at all.
- I told him that.

419
00:19:54,386 --> 00:19:57,221
- What did he say?
- He said he was gonna kill me.

420
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,891
Did he say it the way Mac says it to me
or did it seem like he meant it?

421
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,460
- I mean it when I say it to you.
<i>- He was very upset.</i>

422
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:04,629
Tell him I'm gonna go right now
to look at the raw interview again

423
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,497
and that he can look at it
with me if he wants.

424
00:20:06,598 --> 00:20:08,098
All right.

425
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,300
- We knew things were gonna happen.
- Yeah.

426
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:12,669
Chemical weapons expert
wants to kill me.

427
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,571
I make the worst enemies.

428
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,573
Seriously,
I'm a perfectly nice guy.

429
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:20,877
People are celebrating
out there.

430
00:20:20,978 --> 00:20:23,747
- Yeah, I'm coming out.
- Who's playing?

431
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,249
<i>The California Golden Bears
are hosting the UCLA Bruins.</i>

432
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,984
You'll watch anything,
won't you?

433
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:30,853
Yeah.

434
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,591
Why are there two clocks?

435
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:38,761
One's the game clock
and one's the play clock.

436
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,128
<i>The game clock is showing
how much time is left in the quarter</i>

437
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:43,832
and the play clock shows
how much time is left to get off the play.

438
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,800
They only have a certain amount of time
to complete the play?

439
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:47,936
They only have a certain amount of time
to start the play.

440
00:20:48,036 --> 00:20:49,838
Don't have that rule in soccer.

441
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:51,506
They don't have
any rules in soccer.

442
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:53,675
That's why you think a game
that ends in a zero-zero tie

443
00:20:53,776 --> 00:20:55,209
- is a gamely fought match.
- It's called nil-nil.

444
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,878
I was trying to keep it
from being worse.

445
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:58,212
I was helping you out.

446
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,282
Do any other sports
have enforced pacing?

447
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,150
Does baseball?

448
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:06,687
No, pitchers commonly
go for a sandwich between pitches.

449
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,459
Golf you can be
penalized for slow play.

450
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:14,827
Hockey you can hang
onto the puck for as long as you want,

451
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:17,730
but before too long a guy
named Lars is gonna hurt you.

452
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:20,533
Basketball has a shot clock.
You've got 24 seconds

453
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:22,668
to put up a shot,
or in college it's 35.

454
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:24,637
Tennis you can lose
a point for slow play.

455
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:25,905
- Listen.
- Yeah.

456
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:28,008
Should we be worried about
the Stomtonovich call?

457
00:21:28,109 --> 00:21:31,210
- It's on film.
- Okay.

458
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:33,545
I'm gonna look at it again now.

459
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:35,947
Go Bruins!
Beat the Golden Bears.

460
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:37,616
Beat them as hard as you can.

461
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:39,518
Beat them with impunity!

462
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:42,321
- You have no idea what you're saying.
- I know.

463
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,325
- We thought the DOD would have--
<i>- I thought.</i>

464
00:21:47,426 --> 00:21:50,428
<i>I</i> thought the DOD

465
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:52,997
would have a response
on their website by midnight.

466
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:55,466
But by 6:00 A.M. we hadn't
heard anything yet.

467
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,135
Come on in.

468
00:21:57,236 --> 00:21:59,170
Excuse me.

469
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:04,174
- You guys have met?
- We have.

470
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:07,244
- How are you?
- Good, thank you.

471
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,981
She says she never heard
Stomtonovich say it happened.

472
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,017
- Then that's what it is.
- Even in her condition?

473
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:16,853
- Hmm?
- You'd take her word for it in her condition?

474
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:18,987
In the condition she was in
when they did the interview?

475
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,990
She's not in a condition,
and, yes, I'd take her word for it.

476
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,093
If she wasn't sure,
she'd say she wasn't sure.

477
00:22:24,194 --> 00:22:26,962
On the witness stand,
that's not gonna sound like honorable loyalty.

478
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:28,797
It's gonna sound like you're
willing to believe anybody

479
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:32,101
as long as you slept with them.

480
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:35,370
This is the very last polling data
taken before the polls open tomorrow.

481
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,004
Who's gonna win?

482
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,839
The president
will be reelected.

483
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:41,676
But Tulsi Gabbard's gonna
win in Hawaii's second.

484
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,445
She'll be the first
Samoan in Congress.

485
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:46,114
And Kerry Bentivolio
is gonna take the seat

486
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:48,083
vacated by Thaddeus McCotter,

487
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:51,685
who came out with my pick
for the best resignation statement of all time.

488
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:55,689
"The recent event's totalities of calumnies,
indignities and deceits

489
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,624
have weighed most heavily
upon my family.

490
00:22:57,725 --> 00:23:00,427
Thus, acutely aware
one cannot rebuild their hearth

491
00:23:00,528 --> 00:23:02,762
among the ruins
of their US House office,

492
00:23:02,863 --> 00:23:05,698
for the sake of my loved ones,
I must strike another match,

493
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:08,101
go start anew
by embracing the promotion

494
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:12,071
back from public servant
to sovereign citizen."

495
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:14,574
Sounds like he and his friends
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern

496
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:18,144
are about to take a journey by sea
to ask the Duke of Verona for his most kind blessing.

497
00:23:20,114 --> 00:23:21,646
I like you, Keefer.

498
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:23,982
My trust in Maggie

499
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,884
has nothing to do with anything
but the right things.

500
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:30,922
6:00 A.M.,
you hadn't heard from the DOD.

501
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:32,757
7:00 A.M.,
8:00 A.M., nothing.

502
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:34,759
- <i>Maybe they hadn't seen the show.</i>
- They see the Internet.

503
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,394
This was Monday morning,
September 10.

504
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:38,329
Yeah.

505
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,431
You had another story
creeping up on you.

506
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:42,433
Nobody knew that yet.

507
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:45,702
Everybody below the producer level
has to take a shift doing the book.

508
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:47,338
That morning it was Neal's turn.

509
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,140
What's the book?

510
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,975
<i>Neal.</i>

511
00:23:52,076 --> 00:23:54,310
It seems like it's my turn
more often than it should be.

512
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,212
- Man up.
- I'm always manned up.

513
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:58,748
- That's my default mode.
- Then go into ultra man mode.

514
00:23:58,849 --> 00:24:00,783
The women here couldn't deal
with my ultra man mode.

515
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:02,352
Probably not.
Are you gonna take this?

516
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:03,686
It's heavy.

517
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:08,491
- Intern.
- Yes?

518
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:09,758
Come on over.

519
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:14,763
This is the overnight book.

520
00:24:14,864 --> 00:24:18,367
The night crew puts together every story
and every press release from everywhere.

521
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:20,335
Go through this
and separate it into four piles--

522
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:23,172
knew that, didn't know that,
don't care, and Shakira.

523
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:24,806
But that one's just for me,
all right?

524
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:26,474
<i>Neal.</i>

525
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:30,878
- There's no statement yet.
- I know.

526
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:32,680
It's the Pentagon.

527
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:34,448
Is it possible they've responded
in a secret corner of the Internet?

528
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,083
Secret corner of the Internet?

529
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,819
Slay a dungeon wizard
to get the keys to Mordor or something?

530
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,621
- It's not possible.
- Something that we need that Dumbledore--

531
00:24:40,722 --> 00:24:42,855
- Listen to yourself.
- I know, it's getting worse as I go on.

532
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:44,824
- And it didn't start in a great place.
- Nothing in the book?

533
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:47,126
Well, there are gonna be a ton of things in the book,
but not from the Pentagon.

534
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:49,362
- On the off chance someone got a quote from them.
- We'd know about it.

535
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:50,564
Obviously I'm grasping at straws,
Neal.

536
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:51,898
There's no call
to be patronizing.

537
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,733
- You're right.
- Thank you.

538
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,902
- Well, you're not, 'cause Mordor--
- I'm not the expert.

539
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:58,704
- You don't say.
- Do the book and don't just farm it out to an intern.

540
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:01,273
I'm delegating.

541
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:07,413
- Fast Nationals?
- Right here.

542
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:09,215
Just tell me if the number
begins with a three.

543
00:25:09,316 --> 00:25:11,317
- It doesn't.
- 2.9?

544
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:12,685
2.7?

545
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:15,286
5.8 million viewers.

546
00:25:16,988 --> 00:25:18,789
- Shut the fuck up.
- That's gonna double

547
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,226
when they add live plus same day
and live plus seven.

548
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:22,527
- Jesus Christ!
- Congratulations.

549
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:24,195
Congratulations, man!

550
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:25,930
Tracking looked good,
but not like this.

551
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:28,099
That's an <i>I Love Lucy</i> number.

552
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:31,401
Yes.

553
00:25:31,502 --> 00:25:33,604
Yes. What?

554
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:36,406
Don't worry about the call
from Stomtonovich.

555
00:25:36,507 --> 00:25:37,608
I'm not.

556
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,443
I am a little bit
and I'll tell you why.

557
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:41,445
He didn't sound
like a guy with cold feet.

558
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:42,912
He was certain of what he said

559
00:25:43,013 --> 00:25:45,248
and he said it to me three times
the exact same way.

560
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:47,265
There was one camera.
No cuts.

561
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,084
He's not a young guy.
It all happened fast.

562
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:51,587
He's thinking about the size of it
for the first time now.

563
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:54,690
Yes. Yeah.

564
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,792
The size of it.

565
00:25:58,395 --> 00:25:59,795
A new story creeping up on us?

566
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:01,496
<i>The morning of September 10.</i>

567
00:26:01,597 --> 00:26:03,197
<i>The day after the broadcast.</i>

568
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,533
It was Neal's turn
to do the overnight book,

569
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:09,271
- but he staffed it out to an intern.
- Jenna Johnson.

570
00:26:09,372 --> 00:26:11,906
Are you talking about Benghazi?

571
00:26:13,142 --> 00:26:14,676
Anything?

572
00:26:14,777 --> 00:26:17,044
Jerry Brown's challenged
Chris Christie to a race.

573
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:18,746
Sponsored by HeartBlast,

574
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:20,947
a new defibrillator company
from the people who brought you--

575
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:23,049
Piers Morgan and Rihanna had
a Twitter fight about her haircut.

576
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:25,653
I'll give you $100
if you go pitch that to Will.

577
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:27,888
I know you're not gonna
think this one's important, but it is.

578
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:29,590
- <i>Star</i> magazine...
- Nope.

579
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:32,793
...is reporting that a palace source confirmed
that Kate Middleton is pregnant.

580
00:26:32,894 --> 00:26:35,961
- That's news I want to hear.
- You just did. Anything else?

581
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,331
Lady Gaga showed
a lot of cleavage

582
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:41,434
- at an after-party for the Paralympic Games.
- Put that one aside.

583
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:44,570
- Oh, and Terry Jones the Florida pastor?
- Yeah.

584
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:48,274
He's screening the trailer to
a movie called <i>Innocence of Muslims</i>.

585
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,841
- We thought--
<i>I thought.</i>

586
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,313
I thought, everyone thought

587
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:56,915
that when the DOD posted its response,
it would be vague.

588
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:59,851
<i>"Pentagon doesn't comment
on classified operations,</i>

589
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,853
but we have serious problems
with this story

590
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,656
aired by Atlantis Cable News last night."
Something like that.

591
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:07,858
You know the reason it was
taking them so long to respond?

592
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,527
No.

593
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,762
They were bringing a lawyer
into the Pentagon press office.

594
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,699
- Pentagon counsel?
<i>- And another lawyer.</i>

595
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,701
Matlock?

596
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,770
The Attorney General.
They weren't fucking around.

597
00:27:53,902 --> 00:27:55,503
We knew there'd be pushback.

598
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:02,176
<i>But not like that.</i>

599
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:04,846
"We are considering any
and all legal remedies

600
00:28:04,946 --> 00:28:07,849
available to us including
under the Espionage Act.

601
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:11,618
In the interim,
we will begin declassifying documents

602
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:14,020
to prove the falsity
of ACN's claims."

603
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:15,722
If I'm a lawyer in that room,

604
00:28:15,823 --> 00:28:17,891
I don't write that response
unless I'm sure.

605
00:28:17,992 --> 00:28:19,292
We were sure.

606
00:28:19,394 --> 00:28:21,294
Still?
It's noon, Monday.

607
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:24,431
Charlie got everyone together
in the conference room.

608
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:27,533
<i>He polled everyone to see
if they were still standing by the story.</i>

609
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:42,580
<i>People were resolved.</i>

610
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:44,582
<i>Jim had already said his piece.</i>

611
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:47,318
<i>His job was to support Mac now,
and that's what he was doing.</i>

612
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,186
<i>At the expense of good advice?</i>

613
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:50,888
He'd given his advice.

614
00:28:50,989 --> 00:28:53,757
And Charlie, Mac,
and Will had given their instructions.

615
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,993
Of course they pushed back.
What do we expect them to--

616
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:58,629
"Well, you caught us.
Bravo to you, sirs.

617
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,864
We'll walk ourselves
over to Leavenworth now."

618
00:29:00,966 --> 00:29:03,334
<i>You know at some point
at Little Big Horn,</i>

619
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:05,235
I'll bet Custer led
a unanimous vote

620
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:07,304
where everyone said,
"I still think we can win."

621
00:29:07,405 --> 00:29:09,339
Then came Elliot's show
that night.

622
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,108
You know,
Elliot was really the only guy on the team

623
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,244
who hadn't gotten dirty
with Genoa yet.

624
00:29:14,345 --> 00:29:16,246
So we dropped dirt on him.

625
00:29:16,347 --> 00:29:17,713
Go.

626
00:29:17,815 --> 00:29:19,449
<i>The second
MARSOC team dropped sarin?</i>

627
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,016
- Yes.
<i>- You're sure?</i>

628
00:29:21,117 --> 00:29:23,452
- Yes.
- That's why you wore the MOPP suits?

629
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,920
That's why we wore
the MOPP suits

630
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:26,455
and that's why civilians died.

631
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,258
That was another clip from
last night's <i>ACN Reports</i>,

632
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:30,759
the startling
and provocative story

633
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,861
of the extraction
of two captured Marines.

634
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:35,230
<i>Joining us by satellite from Trenton,
New Jersey,</i>

635
00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:37,631
is former Marine Gunnery
Sergeant Eric Sweeney,

636
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:40,201
a member of the MARSOC team
that executed the extraction,

637
00:29:40,302 --> 00:29:41,569
which was codenamed Genoa,

638
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,471
and I should say
the first member of the team

639
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:45,373
to step forward
and tell his story.

640
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:46,874
- Welcome, Mr. Sweeney.
- Thank you.

641
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:49,610
Let's start there. What made you
come forward and speak to the press?

642
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,212
I wish I could say
it was honorable.

643
00:29:51,313 --> 00:29:52,546
It was a guilty conscience.

644
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:54,381
- Guilty that...?
- I knew what we'd done.

645
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:56,516
"Any and all
legal remedies."

646
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:58,085
Is that something
they usually say?

647
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:00,187
They said it when the SEAL
released his bin Laden book.

648
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:02,655
- They haven't charged him.
- The Espionage Act?

649
00:30:02,756 --> 00:30:05,425
Do you know how many journalists have ever
been tried under the Espionage Act?

650
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:06,926
- None.
- Good.

651
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:08,761
'Cause you wouldn't
make it in jail, Don.

652
00:30:08,863 --> 00:30:10,596
I'd survive, but you wouldn't.

653
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:12,598
In fact, I'd thrive.

654
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:13,799
How do you figure?

655
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,968
<i>Shawshank</i>.

656
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:18,270
I'd do everybody's taxes
and invest the warden's money.

657
00:30:18,372 --> 00:30:20,739
What are you gonna do?
Produce their nightly news show?

658
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,075
- Is this our sound or his?
- His. We're good.

659
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:24,877
<i>We want to be
a force multiplier</i>

660
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:27,078
where one of us can do the work
of several infantrymen.

661
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:30,815
"The charge that US Special Operations
used sarin gas is absolutely false."

662
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:33,018
I don't know.
Absolutely?

663
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,652
Why not just say false?

664
00:30:34,753 --> 00:30:36,521
"Absolutely" sounds like
the kind of word you use--

665
00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:38,589
This isn't like the time
Chip left you a message in eighth grade

666
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:42,192
and you and your friends did a lab analysis
to figure out if it meant he liked you.

667
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:47,331
Chet was his name

668
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:49,600
and sometimes boys are vague
with their messages.

669
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:51,836
<i>Was that the first time
that you had to perform</i>

670
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:53,571
<i>a medical procedure in action?</i>

671
00:30:53,672 --> 00:30:55,205
Move him back to Genoa
when you can.

672
00:30:55,306 --> 00:30:57,841
We have advanced combat medicine
as part of our training.

673
00:30:57,942 --> 00:31:01,210
The first time I had to use it,
we were on a mission to pay some tribal leaders...

674
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:02,812
I don't know what he's
talking about anymore.

675
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:05,048
We hit two IEDs
and my Humvee blew apart

676
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:08,151
and three of us sustained TBis--
Traumatic brain injuries.

677
00:31:08,252 --> 00:31:09,986
<i>And I was dragging
a friend of mine...</i>

678
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:12,288
Did he say "us"?

679
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:15,524
He said "the three of us."
Traumatic brain injury. He said that.

680
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,225
- TBI?
- I heard it.

681
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:19,494
Sergeant, did you say that you sustained
a traumatic brain injury?

682
00:31:19,596 --> 00:31:22,264
- Well, it wasn't serious.
- Get out.

683
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:25,133
- Did you disclose that information to the--
- Get out!

684
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:27,536
Okay, we've got to go to break,

685
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,204
<i>but we're coming back
with Eric Sweeney,</i>

686
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,406
<i>a MARSOC on Operation Genoa.</i>

687
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:34,842
<i>This is </i>Right Now<i>.</i>

688
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:53,860
I saw it.

689
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:57,564
There's a problem
with the story.

690
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,332
<i>I know.</i>

691
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:08,440
Shh.

692
00:32:08,541 --> 00:32:10,610
All right.

693
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,645
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

694
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:15,848
I'm sorry I'm late.
There was a deer on the Merritt Parkway.

695
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:18,683
The deer ran across
and the car two in front of me hit it.

696
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:21,019
- Was everyone all right?
- Yeah.

697
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,353
Mac.

698
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:24,322
Why didn't we know
about the TBI?

699
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:26,324
Everybody listen, okay?
Believe me, I cornered him--

700
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:27,892
We knew he had
two Purple Hearts.

701
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:29,728
I got him on the phone
in Trenton as soon--

702
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:32,063
Just back up.
We'll do this step by step.

703
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:33,231
He had two Purple Hearts.

704
00:32:33,332 --> 00:32:35,032
The medical information
is sealed and classified.

705
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,868
He told us one is
for a shrapnel wound in his left shoulder

706
00:32:37,969 --> 00:32:40,704
sustained during an ambush
during his first tour in '08.

707
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:42,640
- The second is--
- The second, he told us,

708
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:44,875
was for a stab wound
in his leg he got while trying

709
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:47,477
to subdue an angry teenage militant
in Kapisa Province.

710
00:32:47,578 --> 00:32:49,379
That's the one
he was lying about.

711
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,247
<i>The second Purple Heart
was for the TBI.</i>

712
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:53,783
- He showed us the knife wound.
- I asked him about that, too.

713
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:55,885
He got it in his kitchen
trying to open a CD.

714
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:59,255
He didn't--
He didn't tell us about the TBI

715
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:01,090
because he didn't think
we'd believe his story.

716
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:02,792
Isn't that another
way of saying

717
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:05,661
he wanted to tell
the Genoa story so badly he lied?

718
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:08,130
Well, so why would he lie about
a story that wasn't true?

719
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,798
What's the biggest
effect of a TBI?

720
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,734
- I get that it's memory loss.
- It's memory loss.

721
00:33:12,835 --> 00:33:14,770
And it's dizziness
and speech deficits.

722
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:17,505
We didn't see any of those
in the hundred hours we spent with him.

723
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:19,207
I don't understand.
So at least he doesn't have

724
00:33:19,308 --> 00:33:20,942
all the symptoms of
a traumatic brain injury?

725
00:33:21,044 --> 00:33:23,144
GI Jim,
what percentage of soldiers

726
00:33:23,244 --> 00:33:25,112
<i>taken to Walter Reed
have a TBI?</i>

727
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:26,613
- A lot.
- It's 30%.

728
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:29,083
So we're not gonna listen
to a third of wounded vets?

729
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:31,786
We made this one a key witness
in an accusation of murder.

730
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:33,187
He lied about an injury

731
00:33:33,288 --> 00:33:35,589
and the injury's number one symptom
is memory loss.

732
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:37,691
Bring him up from Trenton.

733
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:41,761
I'll do a preinterview myself
and if I'm satisfied,

734
00:33:41,862 --> 00:33:44,330
I can put him through a direct examination
on the air and clean this up.

735
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:47,633
Yeah, and can I just remind everybody
Sweeney's not our only witness.

736
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,602
We've got Stomtonovich
and Valenzuela.

737
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:53,073
Two more witnesses,
only 50% of whom are recanting what they said.

738
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:54,639
Stomtonovich can recant
all he wants.

739
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,842
We have the unedited tape
and Jerry and Maggie were there.

740
00:33:56,943 --> 00:33:59,778
- Mm-hmm.
- For the record, I wasn't.

741
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:01,279
Wasn't what?

742
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,684
I was sent out of the room
before the interview started.

743
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:07,786
- Good. Let's get it all out now.
- Why?

744
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:10,021
You and Charlie told him
it was going to be Jerry.

745
00:34:10,122 --> 00:34:11,956
You didn't tell him
an AP was coming along.

746
00:34:12,057 --> 00:34:15,159
He'd had me investigated,
but not Maggie, so he didn't feel comfortable--

747
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,394
- You were the only one in the room with him?
- Yeah, I was.

748
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:19,230
- And I see what's happening here.
- Nothing's happening.

749
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:20,664
Can I bring something else up?

750
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:23,868
We aired the story 27 hours ago,
so, yeah, now's the time.

751
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,603
We aborted the interview
with Sweeney tonight.

752
00:34:25,704 --> 00:34:27,104
- I did.
- Uh, I did.

753
00:34:27,205 --> 00:34:28,772
- Should you have?
- I don't know.

754
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:31,074
I was suddenly in a position
where I was asking questions

755
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:33,176
I didn't know the answers to
about our own story.

756
00:34:33,277 --> 00:34:35,511
If it hadn't been our own story,
wouldn't you have kept going?

757
00:34:35,613 --> 00:34:37,647
"Did you disclose that
to the Genoa producers?

758
00:34:37,749 --> 00:34:40,851
No? You lied? How has a TBI
for which you received a Purple Heart--"

759
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:43,719
Yes, he would have kept going.
I shut him down.

760
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,554
- It was live.
- That doesn't make us look great.

761
00:34:45,655 --> 00:34:47,923
Looking great wasn't one
of their options right then.

762
00:34:48,024 --> 00:34:50,192
Everybody knock it off!

763
00:34:50,293 --> 00:34:52,728
Sister Mary Mother of God.

764
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,998
We have a problem.
That's all it is.

765
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,499
We're not gonna have
a fucking scrum.

766
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:03,071
<i>What do we have?
What?</i>

767
00:35:03,172 --> 00:35:05,506
A retired Marine general

768
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,008
started getting calls
from his buddies.

769
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:08,509
"What the hell
is going on?"

770
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,178
His voice was altered.
His face was blacked.

771
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:13,214
There are six people
who have the information he has

772
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:15,482
and generals don't have
dumb friends.

773
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,984
What else?

774
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:18,952
A witness who once
had a concussion.

775
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:20,553
- While saving other people's lives.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

776
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:24,224
- That's not--
- Jim, while being courageous.

777
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:27,261
And he was courageous again
stepping forward.

778
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:29,663
Kids used to lie
about their age

779
00:35:29,764 --> 00:35:31,430
to get in the Army
and fight in a war.

780
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:33,266
That's what Sweeney did here.

781
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,801
How much of what you're saying
do you believe right now?

782
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:35,968
60%.

783
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:37,503
I thought it was
in the mid-80s.

784
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:39,605
- You pulled it off.
- Experience.

785
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:41,373
You need to talk
to Deep Throat.

786
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,242
I'm on the first shuttle
to Washington.

787
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:45,711
- Have you talked to him on the phone?
- We don't talk on phones.

788
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,879
- How about your guy?
- We talk on phones.

789
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,514
He's asking have you
talked to your guy?

790
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:51,249
- An hour ago.
- And?

791
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,584
He says stand by the story.

792
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,226
We go back over every inch
starting right now.

793
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,895
By 8:00 tonight,
I want Will to be able to say we stand by it.

794
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,331
And when he says it,
we stand by it.

795
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,433
Break 'em into teams.

796
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,707
Had you realized yet
at the time of that meeting

797
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,842
that Sweeney and Stomtonovich
weren't your only problem?

798
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,776
Who says they weren't
our only problem?

799
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,746
Right. That was an example
of a leading question.

800
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,250
A leading question
suggests its own answer.

801
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,819
When did you stop beating your wife,
right?

802
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,254
We never established
I beat my wife.

803
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,022
We never established
you're married.

804
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:34,189
- <i>I'm not.</i>
- Yeah.

805
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,325
I'm not following you, Rebecca.

806
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:39,328
MacKenzie had realized
at the time of the meeting

807
00:36:39,428 --> 00:36:40,863
- that Sweeney and Stomtonovich--
- There's no way.

808
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:43,098
- There's no way.
- Jim, listen to me.

809
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,666
There's no way
Mac's to blame for this.

810
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,134
Valenzuela was
your third witness.

811
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:48,670
I've seen lawyers do some things in my life.
Jesus.

812
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,372
Just listen.

813
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:53,508
First red team, you have Sweeney,
you don't go to air.

814
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:56,911
Red team two, you have Sweeney
and Stomtonovich, you don't go to air.

815
00:36:57,012 --> 00:37:00,415
Red team three,
you have Valenzuela now

816
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:02,149
<i>and Charlie
green-lights it.</i>

817
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:06,087
Valenzuela was
an important witness.

818
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:09,022
Yeah.

819
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:10,891
And?

820
00:37:10,992 --> 00:37:13,494
What if I led him?

821
00:37:13,595 --> 00:37:16,029
- Valenzuela?
- In his preinterview.

822
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,964
I've read the preinterview
transcript 100 times.

823
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:20,333
I read it 1,000 times,
but I've just read it again

824
00:37:20,435 --> 00:37:22,769
and I have to wonder
if I inadvertently led on that witness.

825
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,804
- You didn't.
- I can make the case that I did.

826
00:37:24,905 --> 00:37:26,305
Look at what's good
on the story.

827
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,508
Stomtonovich,
he didn't like the report.

828
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:30,009
Sorry,
but we've got him on film.

829
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,944
<i>Sweeney, he wants to be heard</i>

830
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:34,547
and he thinks he'll be discounted
'cause of the TBI, so he lies.

831
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:36,716
And by the way,
if I had a traumatic brain injury

832
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:38,517
and knew that information
couldn't be discovered

833
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:41,319
unless I volunteered it,
I wouldn't volunteer it.

834
00:37:41,421 --> 00:37:44,790
I have a source.
Is it POTUS? No. It's better.

835
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:46,825
What would it take for you
to tell me the source?

836
00:37:46,926 --> 00:37:48,226
Someone would have
to be torturing you.

837
00:37:48,327 --> 00:37:49,661
That's sweet, but--

838
00:37:49,762 --> 00:37:51,830
Charlie has a source.
You trust Charlie?

839
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:53,932
- Of course.
- And we have Valenzuela.

840
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:55,766
There is much more about
this story that's good--

841
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,735
And I'm saying
what if I led Valenzuela?

842
00:37:57,836 --> 00:37:59,603
I objected to that
in courtrooms for years.

843
00:37:59,704 --> 00:38:01,505
I know what a leading
question sounds like.

844
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:02,873
Then you know I asked them.

845
00:38:02,974 --> 00:38:04,308
You have to ask them
in these situations.

846
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:05,643
The guy--
He was reluctant.

847
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:06,877
He didn't want to talk.

848
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:09,346
Read the first line
on page three.

849
00:38:10,748 --> 00:38:13,750
"McHale: We have
a three-star general

850
00:38:13,851 --> 00:38:15,718
who's an expert
in chemical weapons."

851
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,120
We have a three-star general
who's an expert in chemical weapons.

852
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:19,722
Do you think he's lying?

853
00:38:28,966 --> 00:38:32,268
There was a video camera on
a tripod to record the pre--

854
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:35,271
what if he thought
the camera--

855
00:38:35,372 --> 00:38:37,273
What if he thought
the interview might get--

856
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:40,176
You know, and he doesn't
want to call a general a liar?

857
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:41,743
- That's nuts.
- It's not.

858
00:38:41,845 --> 00:38:44,679
He came to us.
He didn't want Sweeney to stand alone.

859
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,882
And if Sweeney's wrong,
then I gave the wrong information to Valenzuela.

860
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:51,819
Valenzuela's whole interview was goosed
by the information that came before it.

861
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,088
<i>Sweeney says everyone
was wearing MOPP suits.</i>

862
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:55,823
He told you that?

863
00:38:55,924 --> 00:38:59,326
What if Sweeney's got problems
and what if Valenzuela's his only friend?

864
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:01,362
Look at line 303.

865
00:39:03,832 --> 00:39:05,665
I don't want Sweeney
to stand alone.

866
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,267
He doesn't raise
one original fact in this interview.

867
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:09,803
Read it again.

868
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:11,605
By the end,
it's a recitation of everything

869
00:39:11,706 --> 00:39:14,340
he's heard from Sweeney
and from me.

870
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:18,945
You need to sleep.

871
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:30,455
A garage?

872
00:39:30,557 --> 00:39:33,225
- Seriously?
- They still work.

873
00:39:33,326 --> 00:39:35,628
This place can't afford
security monitors.

874
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,830
What brings you
to Washington, DC?

875
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:41,566
- We're having trouble with the story.
- No shit.

876
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,701
Tell me one more time
we got it right.

877
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:46,070
You want to see
some pictures of David?

878
00:39:46,171 --> 00:39:48,606
- I'm sorry?
- Do you want to see some pictures of David?

879
00:39:48,707 --> 00:39:50,675
- Who's David?
- David's my son, Charlie.

880
00:39:50,776 --> 00:39:52,510
Is there a problem
with the story?

881
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:55,712
There he is.
We're moving him into his dorm at BU.

882
00:39:55,813 --> 00:39:58,348
And here he's home
for Thanksgiving.

883
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:01,151
- Shep.
- Hang on.

884
00:40:01,252 --> 00:40:04,688
That's on the Cape.
We rent a house in August.

885
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:08,458
Here's a picture he sent me
his first day interning at ACN.

886
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,893
<i>And there he is, first day home</i>

887
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:13,195
<i>from rehab at Sierra Tucson.</i>

888
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:16,899
And this one's from
his funeral last year.

889
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:22,237
Jesus, Shep.

890
00:40:22,338 --> 00:40:24,206
I know, I took
a picture at a funeral.

891
00:40:24,307 --> 00:40:26,041
That's crazy,
but it's just for you.

892
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:28,509
They call it heron now.

893
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:30,745
Like the bird,
just a little heron.

894
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:32,146
I didn't have any idea.

895
00:40:32,247 --> 00:40:35,850
You hired him
as a summer intern on his 90th day.

896
00:40:35,952 --> 00:40:38,019
Three months is a landmark
in that world.

897
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,488
Three everything-- Three days,
three weeks, three months, three years.

898
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,489
Who the fuck knows why?

899
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:45,859
- Are you sure you don't want to sit?
- We're in a garage!

900
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:47,828
We can go somewhere.

901
00:40:47,929 --> 00:40:50,030
One of your people, Charlie,
one of your people--

902
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:52,933
One of <i>your</i> people fired him
and you didn't stop it.

903
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,603
I wish, man-- I wish you'd talked.
There's an explanation.

904
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,404
You didn't stop it.

905
00:40:57,505 --> 00:41:00,506
He was a good kid.
He was a smart kid and a worker.

906
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:03,743
He was a 19-year-old junkie,
but he was clean 90 days.

907
00:41:03,844 --> 00:41:05,979
- Our social media guy runs the interns.
- Neal Sampat.

908
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,546
- David...
- Whose name you didn't know.

909
00:41:07,648 --> 00:41:10,083
...was posting--
Is this something you really want to hear?

910
00:41:10,183 --> 00:41:12,752
Yes.
From you, badly.

911
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:15,854
- I never knew anything--
- He posted something on the Internet?

912
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:17,756
- Look.
- Yeah?

913
00:41:17,857 --> 00:41:22,360
A couple of years ago,
<i>News Night</i> got a new EP and the show--

914
00:41:22,461 --> 00:41:25,030
Boy, is your wife--

915
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:26,798
Linda is my ex-wife.

916
00:41:26,899 --> 00:41:28,800
The show took a turn and what?

917
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,126
David posted things about it
on the Internet he didn't like.

918
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:36,040
Things about--

919
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:38,242
- He was politically engaged.
- Mm-hmm.

920
00:41:38,343 --> 00:41:39,977
- Neal--
- Neal Sampat.

921
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:42,146
Neal warned him
he can't do that

922
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,281
and he kept on doing it.

923
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:46,549
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't step in.

924
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:48,451
He deserved to be fired.

925
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:53,389
How many stories
have I given you?

926
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:57,027
There was a moment a while back

927
00:41:57,128 --> 00:41:59,829
I thought about
having you killed.

928
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,765
Then I thought,
"What does Charlie Skinner fear more than death?"

929
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:06,601
Sit back, wait for your moment.

930
00:42:06,703 --> 00:42:10,973
Then Jerry Dantana starts
calling MARSOCs about Genoa.

931
00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:14,076
The helo manifest you gave me.

932
00:42:14,177 --> 00:42:16,478
Hold it over light
for 20 seconds.

933
00:42:20,716 --> 00:42:23,718
So that happened.

934
00:42:23,819 --> 00:42:25,987
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

935
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:27,655
Are you kidding me
with this story?

936
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,590
No, this is all--

937
00:42:29,692 --> 00:42:32,293
All terribly true.

938
00:42:32,394 --> 00:42:34,627
There are protests erupting in Cairo.

939
00:42:34,729 --> 00:42:37,764
<i>March 2, 1955.</i>

940
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:39,700
A young black woman is arrested

941
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:43,336
for refusing to give up her seat on a bus
to a white man in Alabama.

942
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:47,307
<i>Civil rights leaders
and the ACLU rush to her side</i>

943
00:42:47,408 --> 00:42:50,209
and she will be a symbol of the struggle
against segregation.

944
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,946
Her name is Claudette Colvin
and she's 15 years old.

945
00:42:54,047 --> 00:42:56,015
She's also unmarried
and pregnant.

946
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:59,384
<i>Civil rights leaders
and the ACLU decide that Colvin</i>

947
00:42:59,485 --> 00:43:02,387
is not the best foot forward
and stand down.

948
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:04,990
Eight months later,
Rosa Parks happens,

949
00:43:05,092 --> 00:43:08,459
but during that eight months,
a brilliant and charismatic young minister

950
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,561
gets the attention
of the community

951
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:13,131
and is chosen to lead
the bus boycotts.

952
00:43:13,232 --> 00:43:15,499
If Claudette Colvin
doesn't get pregnant,

953
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:18,502
if they'd gone in the spring
instead of eight months later,

954
00:43:18,604 --> 00:43:22,505
Martin Luther King is a preacher
you've never heard of in Montgomery.

955
00:43:22,607 --> 00:43:24,875
I've got a few hundred people
outside the embassy

956
00:43:24,976 --> 00:43:26,543
- and so far it's peaceful.
- That's what I've got.

957
00:43:26,644 --> 00:43:28,511
<i>- Which embassy?</i>
- Ours.

958
00:43:28,613 --> 00:43:30,480
- What are they protesting?
<i>- Is anybody getting through to Cairo?</i>

959
00:43:30,581 --> 00:43:33,217
I've got the front desk at the Sheppard Hotel.
It's a couple blocks away.

960
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:36,019
He's saying that people have been streaming
toward the embassy for about an hour.

961
00:43:36,121 --> 00:43:38,254
- Is he saying how many?
- He thinks a couple of thousand.

962
00:43:38,355 --> 00:43:40,723
- Thousand?
- A poli sci professor at AU in Cairo

963
00:43:40,824 --> 00:43:43,492
says that a Salafist leader
named Wesam Abdel-Wareth--

964
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:45,294
He's like
the Glenn Beck of Egypt

965
00:43:45,295 --> 00:43:47,230
and he's the president
of a television station.

966
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,265
He put out a call to protest a movie
called <i>Muhammad's Tribe</i>.

967
00:43:49,366 --> 00:43:50,733
Why are they
at the American embassy?

968
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:52,835
Apparently it's an American movie,
but we can't find it.

969
00:43:52,936 --> 00:43:54,435
Wait a second.

970
00:43:54,536 --> 00:43:59,074
What's the name of the pastor
with the mustache who's crazy?

971
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:00,708
- Terry Jones.
- Yes.

972
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,078
He announced yesterday
that he was screening a movie.

973
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:05,814
- I can't remember the name.
<i>- Innocence of Muslims</i>.

974
00:44:05,915 --> 00:44:07,715
Is it possible
it's the same movie?

975
00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:09,651
<i>Who is Giuseppe Zangara?</i>

976
00:44:09,752 --> 00:44:11,819
I don't really know.
He's a guy with a gun

977
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,156
who fired five shots
in February 15, 1933,

978
00:44:15,257 --> 00:44:17,357
killing the Mayor of Chicago.

979
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:20,161
Why? Because Zangara
was standing on a wobbly chair.

980
00:44:20,262 --> 00:44:22,029
<i>And the Mayor of Chicago
wasn't his target.</i>

981
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:24,198
It was the guy the mayor
was shaking hands with,

982
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:26,499
the newly elected
President Franklin Roosevelt.

983
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,668
If Zangara's chair
isn't wobbly,

984
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:30,970
Roosevelt never takes office

985
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:34,240
and we swear in his running mate,
John Nance Garner,

986
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:37,076
<i>a man whose political ideology
was the basis</i>

987
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:39,813
for his opposition
to a package of legislation

988
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:41,847
that would be called
The New Deal

989
00:44:41,948 --> 00:44:44,850
and we don't survive
the Great Depression.

990
00:44:44,951 --> 00:44:46,351
It's the same movie.
<i>Innocence of Muslims</i>.

991
00:44:46,452 --> 00:44:48,220
He changed the title
to get Muslims in to see it.

992
00:44:48,321 --> 00:44:49,888
There's a mash-up of it
on YouTube.

993
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:52,490
- Does it seem offensive?
- To filmmakers at the very least.

994
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:56,195
Okay, AP has just reported,
"Egyptian Islamist protesters angry over film

995
00:44:56,296 --> 00:44:58,629
scale US Embassy wall in Cairo
and tear down flag."

996
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,431
- The American flag.
- I understand that now.

997
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,333
- Jim, this thing's starting to move.
- They breached the wall.

998
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,401
- They've got a link to their website with a message.
- I'm on their website.

999
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:06,871
"The Embassy of the United States in Cairo
condemns the continuing efforts

1000
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:09,273
by misguided individuals
to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims."

1001
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:10,607
They're apologizing
for the movie?

1002
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,009
2,000 people just
hopped the wall, man.

1003
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,410
I'd apologize
for whatever they want.

1004
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:15,411
- I wouldn't.
- Congratulations.

1005
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,747
MargaretJordan@ACN.com.

1006
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,549
We'll have video of the flag
in about five minutes.

1007
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,084
They took down our flag
and replaced it

1008
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,019
with a black flag
and in Arabic writing it says--

1009
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,488
"There is no God but God
and Muhammad is the prophet of God."

1010
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,390
I hope our apology
was sincere enough.

1011
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:30,060
You want a job as the guy who answers
the front door of the embassy right now?

1012
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:31,561
We're gonna need
more bodies on phones.

1013
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,429
Who are we talking to?
Does London know anything?

1014
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,431
London?
When was the last time you slept?

1015
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:37,967
I've been busy standing by Genoa.
What about you?

1016
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,335
I have no problem
standing by it.

1017
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:40,970
You were well trained.

1018
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,072
Guys, another
demonstration's broken out.

1019
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:44,741
- In Cairo?
- In Libya.

1020
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,441
Outside our consulate
in Benghazi.

1021
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:48,142
<i>Your kitchen faucet has washers.</i>

1022
00:45:48,244 --> 00:45:50,479
They keep water from leaking through
the joints in the fixtures.

1023
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,880
And that's what O-rings do.

1024
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:54,349
They're giant washers
that keep pressurized hydrogen

1025
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,118
from leaking out of the SRB,
the solid rocket booster,

1026
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:59,454
<i>that shoots the space shuttle
out of the Earth's atmosphere.</i>

1027
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:01,790
These O-rings have been
tested and tested

1028
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:05,125
under every possible
circumstance but one-- cold.

1029
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:07,795
They didn't test to see if the O-rings
worked when it was cold.

1030
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:09,497
Why would they even think
to test for that?

1031
00:46:09,598 --> 00:46:11,031
The thing's launching
from south Florida.

1032
00:46:11,132 --> 00:46:12,566
When's it gonna be cold?

1033
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:15,135
On January 28, 1986,

1034
00:46:15,236 --> 00:46:19,138
<i>a cold snap dragged
the overnight temperature down to 18 degrees</i>

1035
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:23,309
and it turns out the O-rings
stopped working below 40.

1036
00:46:23,411 --> 00:46:27,179
So 73 seconds after
the Challenger lifts off,

1037
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:29,015
it converts itself into a bomb

1038
00:46:29,116 --> 00:46:30,983
and detonates.

1039
00:46:31,084 --> 00:46:33,352
An American's dead.
Don't know who.

1040
00:46:33,454 --> 00:46:35,120
- Staff member.
- Consulate staff.

1041
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:37,355
- All this statement says is--
<i>Statement from who?</i>

1042
00:46:37,457 --> 00:46:39,324
Libya's Supreme
Security Committee.

1043
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:42,060
"One American staff member
has died and a number have been injured."

1044
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:44,029
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

1045
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:46,331
I want to stop hearing that answer soon.
We have 90 minutes to air.

1046
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:48,700
- Mac, did you want to look at this?
- Not this second.

1047
00:46:48,802 --> 00:46:50,601
- They're not releasing names.
- Names?

1048
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:52,970
- They have more than one?
- I don't know if that was the implication.

1049
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:55,673
<i>- Mac.</i>
- It's just an LED readout, right?

1050
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:58,008
Yeah. We put it on
brackets on the prompter

1051
00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:00,044
and I've got it on remote
from the control room.

1052
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:02,112
A segment is three minutes
and 50 seconds

1053
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:04,582
and you don't have to be in his ear
at the end of a segment.

1054
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:06,684
He'll appreciate that.
Just leave it here.

1055
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:09,820
I'll show it to him and find out what
neurotic superstition he has for not using it.

1056
00:47:09,921 --> 00:47:12,289
Copy.

1057
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:13,924
<i>Muhammad.</i>

1058
00:47:14,025 --> 00:47:16,593
<i>Muhammad the bastard,
your lady summons you.</i>

1059
00:47:16,694 --> 00:47:18,662
<i>My lady? My lady?</i>

1060
00:47:18,763 --> 00:47:20,730
<i>Don't finish it.</i>

1061
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:25,635
<i>I'm watching you.</i>

1062
00:47:25,736 --> 00:47:27,838
What would a military
response be?

1063
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:31,575
First Marine FAST--
Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team.

1064
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:33,977
They've got--
Right, they've got platoons.

1065
00:47:34,078 --> 00:47:35,612
- <i>In Spain.</i>
<i>- Rota, Spain.</i>

1066
00:47:35,713 --> 00:47:37,747
<i>That's still 12 hours, right?</i>

1067
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:39,482
<i>- Jim would know.</i>
<i>- Where is he?</i>

1068
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:41,884
<i>He and Don are huddled up
working on something.</i>

1069
00:47:58,968 --> 00:48:02,103
So sometimes
it's just the one thing.

1070
00:48:14,782 --> 00:48:17,217
He lucked out.
He wouldn't have been able to do it

1071
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:19,152
if there had been
action in the frame.

1072
00:48:21,723 --> 00:48:24,591
<i>Were any exceptional
measures used in the operation?</i>

1073
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:26,651
<i>Exceptional measures
were called for.</i>

1074
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:29,281
<i>- Like what?</i>
<i>- We used sarin.</i>

1075
00:48:29,295 --> 00:48:32,464
<i>It is right. It is moral and necessary
to use any--</i>

1076
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:38,103
We used sarin.

1077
00:48:38,204 --> 00:48:39,772
<i>It is right.
It is moral--</i>

1078
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,944
<i>Exceptional measures
were called for.</i>

1079
00:48:46,045 --> 00:48:47,378
<i>Like what?</i>

1080
00:48:48,681 --> 00:48:50,181
<i>We used sarin.</i>

1081
00:48:50,282 --> 00:48:51,715
<i>It is right.</i>

1082
00:48:51,816 --> 00:48:54,185
<i>It is moral and necessary
to use any means</i>

1083
00:48:54,286 --> 00:48:56,587
<i>in that situation
and the situation they were in.</i>

1084
00:49:02,727 --> 00:49:04,795
You forgot about
the shot clock.

1085
00:49:04,896 --> 00:49:06,796
Mac.

1086
00:49:06,897 --> 00:49:09,299
Hey, easy does it.

1087
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:15,372
The shot clock jumped

1088
00:49:15,473 --> 00:49:19,242
from 19 to three to two to 14.

1089
00:49:32,522 --> 00:49:34,856
- He said it, Mac.
- How do you not understand what you've done?

1090
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,526
- He said it before we were rolling.
- We have to retract it.

1091
00:49:37,627 --> 00:49:39,594
- He said it to me.
- Do you understand this?

1092
00:49:39,695 --> 00:49:41,963
- Did Genoa happen? It happened.
- That we invented evidence

1093
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:43,664
- to support a story of a war crime.
- It happened.

1094
00:49:43,765 --> 00:49:45,800
Maggie was there. She heard him say it.
She's just fucked up.

1095
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:48,603
- A war crime.
- Yeah, it's a war crime and it happened.

1096
00:49:48,704 --> 00:49:51,038
- No one-- no one--
- We went into Iraq because he had these things.

1097
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,707
- We don't torture, we don't use chemical weapons.
- No one...

1098
00:49:52,808 --> 00:49:54,208
I wouldn't have done this
on any other story

1099
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:56,543
and I wouldn't have done it
unless I was sure.

1100
00:50:02,617 --> 00:50:05,085
...is ever going
to believe us again.

1101
00:50:08,523 --> 00:50:11,890
I think I shouldn't say anything more
until I've talked to a lawyer.

1102
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:18,030
- You're fired.
- I know.

1103
00:50:24,304 --> 00:50:26,771
We don't think the protests in Benghazi
has anything to do with the movie.

1104
00:50:26,872 --> 00:50:28,873
- We don't think it's a protest.
- What do you think it is?

1105
00:50:28,974 --> 00:50:30,575
- A planned, coordinated attack.
- A terrorist attack.

1106
00:50:30,676 --> 00:50:32,544
- He's got a source at State.
- We've used him.

1107
00:50:32,645 --> 00:50:34,112
<i>He saw an e-mail
at the operation center</i>

1108
00:50:34,213 --> 00:50:36,148
to White House,
Pentagon, and FBI saying

1109
00:50:36,249 --> 00:50:39,050
Ansar al-Sharia is claiming credit
for the attack in Benghazi.

1110
00:50:39,152 --> 00:50:41,153
Will, the movie might
just be a coincidence.

1111
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:43,320
It's not a movie.
<i>Avatar</i> is a movie.

1112
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:44,921
How bad is this thing?

1113
00:50:45,023 --> 00:50:46,557
- Oh, it's bad.
- It's really not at all good.

1114
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:47,924
You have been
nothing but bad news

1115
00:50:48,026 --> 00:50:49,460
since you raised your hand
at Northwestern.

1116
00:50:51,863 --> 00:50:55,098
Don and Jim have a source at State
that says he saw an e-mail.

1117
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,434
Ansar al-Sharia is saying
they did Benghazi.

1118
00:50:57,536 --> 00:50:58,901
May have nothing
to do with Cairo

1119
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:01,037
and it's a 9/11
anniversary attack.

1120
00:51:02,473 --> 00:51:04,274
What?

1121
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:06,376
Mac?

1122
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:09,245
We have to retract
Genoa tonight.

1123
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:15,950
All of it.

1124
00:51:40,342 --> 00:51:43,043
<i>A half an hour later,
we retracted the story.</i>

1125
00:51:44,613 --> 00:51:46,379
That was our top story,
not Benghazi.

1126
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,981
On Benghazi we didn't trust
the source at State.

1127
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,783
We didn't trust
anything anymore.

1128
00:51:50,884 --> 00:51:53,320
We reported the same thing
as everybody else

1129
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:55,522
even though we knew
we were probably wrong.

1130
00:51:55,623 --> 00:51:59,426
Protesters, angry over an amateur
American movie denouncing Islam,

1131
00:51:59,527 --> 00:52:02,628
attacked the United States consulate
in Benghazi, Libya, today,

1132
00:52:02,729 --> 00:52:04,930
killing a State Department
officer.

1133
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:06,832
While in Cairo,
demonstrators stormed

1134
00:52:06,933 --> 00:52:08,534
the walls of the United
States Embassy.

1135
00:52:08,635 --> 00:52:11,437
<i>On the anniversary of 9/11...</i>

1136
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,946
We just stopped
being good at--

1137
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,887
Genoa was a real mission.
It was successful.

1138
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:33,725
Sweeney was right
about the MOPP suits,

1139
00:52:33,825 --> 00:52:36,126
just wrong about
the reason they were wearing them.

1140
00:52:36,227 --> 00:52:39,129
It was in case the militants
had biological weapons.

1141
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,698
The white phosphorus
was only laid down to mark the target.

1142
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:43,634
Hamni8 didn't die in the raid.

1143
00:52:43,735 --> 00:52:46,436
His prepaid cell plan ran out.

1144
00:52:46,537 --> 00:52:49,172
It was
an institutional failure.

1145
00:52:49,274 --> 00:52:51,741
Bullshit.

1146
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:56,579
We'll call the election tomorrow
and then resign.

1147
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,081
She's on her way over.
We're meeting her upstairs.

1148
00:52:59,182 --> 00:53:02,951
I'm sorry, Will.
I really am.

1149
00:53:03,052 --> 00:53:05,621
I wanted this
to go another way.

1150
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:10,325
We both knew it wasn't gonna.

1151
00:53:12,258 --> 00:53:17,142
Sync, corrected by icephoenix

1152
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:20,402
<i>Did she seem mad?</i>

1153
00:53:20,503 --> 00:53:22,903
Hmm?

1154
00:53:23,004 --> 00:53:24,905
When you talked
to her on the phone.

1155
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:27,675
It's after midnight.
You think we got her out of bed?

1156
00:53:27,776 --> 00:53:30,411
You did not get me out of bed.
Good night.

1157
00:53:30,512 --> 00:53:32,946
I just paid $1,000
to see <i>Skyfall</i>

1158
00:53:33,047 --> 00:53:35,215
and attend a party
at the Museum of Modern Art.

1159
00:53:35,317 --> 00:53:38,051
The proceeds are going
to the Tribeca Film Festival.

1160
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:40,085
- You know why?
- To support the arts?

1161
00:53:40,187 --> 00:53:42,422
- To meet Daniel Craig.
- Did you?

1162
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:44,590
Hurricane Sandy
and the airports.

1163
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:47,327
- He wasn't there?
- He was not there.

1164
00:53:47,428 --> 00:53:49,395
You look like Daniel Craig.
Get up.

1165
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:53,165
Oh, you look less like him now.

1166
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:55,467
Sit back down.
And what about you?

1167
00:53:55,468 --> 00:53:58,169
Why so glum, sugarplum?

1168
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:01,906
We're gonna resign, Leona.
It's what has to happen now.

1169
00:54:02,007 --> 00:54:04,576
Elliot Hirsch, Sloan Sabbith,

1170
00:54:04,677 --> 00:54:08,413
Terry Smith, <i>Dayside ACN</i>, ACN.

1171
00:54:08,514 --> 00:54:11,882
We understand the integrity of the news
is more important--

1172
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:14,585
Than one individual.
That is beautiful.

1173
00:54:14,686 --> 00:54:16,787
Not as beautiful
as Daniel Craig.

1174
00:54:16,888 --> 00:54:18,389
- Leona.
- I'd have sent my plane.

1175
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:21,091
- I'd have sent my plane.
- We're not fucking around.

1176
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:23,260
You will resign when I fire you

1177
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:25,128
out of petty malice
and not before.

1178
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,063
- Our trust numbers are--
- Yeah, they're bad.

1179
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:30,233
- They're fatal.
- Firing Jerry was obviously the right thing to do,

1180
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:33,002
but it wasn't enough
and we've known that for two months.

1181
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,071
Charlie and I have to go.

1182
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:37,741
- And Twiggy over here?
- It was my fault.

1183
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:39,976
McMac.
Can I call you McMac?

1184
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:42,111
Doesn't matter,
I'm gonna anyway, McMac.

1185
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,780
- Your head's up your ass.
- Mrs. Lansing.

1186
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:47,716
Guy comes in here
into my hizzy--

1187
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:50,586
guy comes in here,
cooks an interview, no remorse.

1188
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:53,154
30 lawyers vet the story,
it goes on air.

1189
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:56,692
You, I don't know what you'd do
to Sherlock Holmes this thing.

1190
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,093
I wouldn't be able
to figure it out

1191
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,794
and I'm the smartest
person in the room.

1192
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:01,128
Well, I wouldn't go that--

1193
00:55:01,229 --> 00:55:03,964
Oh, shut the fuck up,
you Daniel Craig wannabe.

1194
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:05,533
I don't want to be
Daniel Craig.

1195
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:08,369
Well, you should want to be Daniel Craig.
Everybody should.

1196
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,505
Leona, are you stoned?

1197
00:55:10,606 --> 00:55:12,707
You know,
my makeup lasts a long time.

1198
00:55:12,808 --> 00:55:15,308
- Oh, jeez.
- Mrs. Lansing.

1199
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:16,543
No, no, please,
call me--

1200
00:55:16,644 --> 00:55:19,045
Continue to call me
Mrs. Lansing.

1201
00:55:19,146 --> 00:55:22,148
- Leona--
- Guy comes into my house

1202
00:55:22,249 --> 00:55:23,817
which I love.

1203
00:55:23,918 --> 00:55:26,486
Which I bet you guys
didn't know.

1204
00:55:26,587 --> 00:55:29,956
But I love it.
I love ACN.

1205
00:55:30,057 --> 00:55:32,525
You don't make me a nickel

1206
00:55:32,626 --> 00:55:34,693
<i>and you cause headaches
for the divisions that do,</i>

1207
00:55:34,795 --> 00:55:37,730
but you make me--

1208
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:39,965
You make me so proud.

1209
00:55:42,168 --> 00:55:44,503
God, guy comes in here,
cooks an interview,

1210
00:55:44,604 --> 00:55:47,204
and this ends up with--
'Cause he's unemployable

1211
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:49,574
he gets a $5 million settlement

1212
00:55:49,675 --> 00:55:50,942
and the three of you leave?

1213
00:55:51,043 --> 00:55:54,145
Oh, I don't think so.

1214
00:55:54,246 --> 00:55:56,013
And McMac.

1215
00:55:56,114 --> 00:55:58,516
That's a name that's really
starting to grow on me.

1216
00:55:58,536 --> 00:56:02,106
She doesn't have to go.
Nobody's ever heard of her.

1217
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,822
But she's going to do
the honorable thing.

1218
00:56:04,923 --> 00:56:07,024
And what's expected of me, huh?

1219
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:09,060
Not to do the honorable thing?

1220
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:11,695
What's expected of me?

1221
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:14,865
No, I do not accept
your resignations.

1222
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:19,069
And Jerry Dantana's
not gonna get one fucking dollar.

1223
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:21,704
I got some kick-ass
courtroom outfits.

1224
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:24,640
You have to accept our resignations
and you have to settle.

1225
00:56:24,741 --> 00:56:26,242
He'll take it to trial and win.

1226
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:29,846
There was an institutional failure
and he was the only one fired.

1227
00:56:29,947 --> 00:56:31,948
<i>Then you'll need a good lawyer.</i>

1228
00:56:32,049 --> 00:56:35,084
Lee, don't accept
their resignations.

1229
00:56:35,185 --> 00:56:39,021
I already wasn't accepting
their resignations, Becca.

1230
00:56:39,122 --> 00:56:41,590
Don't horn in
on my honorable thing.

1231
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:44,059
God, I mean,
can't a lady have--

1232
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,061
Leona, we don't have

1233
00:56:46,162 --> 00:56:48,730
the trust
of the public anymore.

1234
00:56:48,831 --> 00:56:50,832
Get it back!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
