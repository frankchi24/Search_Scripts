1
00:00:00,317 --> 00:00:02,736
Our elections are
the envy of the world.

2
00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:06,844
It's critically important that we
not make any mistakes tonight.

3
00:00:06,862 --> 00:00:08,283
<i>We made a small mistake.</i>

4
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:10,514
We called Michigan
when we meant Mississippi.

5
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:11,735
You have to retract it.

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,861
I wonder if maybe
it's not necessary to retract it.

7
00:00:13,885 --> 00:00:16,631
I didn't realize that you were
president of the Oxford Union.

8
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:18,831
Cambridge. I was president
of the Cambridge Union.

9
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:20,863
I need you to change
my Wikipedia page.

10
00:00:20,903 --> 00:00:24,167
It's funny the things people try to control
when they feel like they're not in control.

11
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:27,036
You're going to be a named
defendant by Jerry Dantana.

12
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:30,263
- He's suing me for giving him a bad job recommendation?
- It's just strategy.

13
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:32,120
- Say what you want to say to me.
- What?

14
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:34,584
Fire me.
You're the only one who can do it.

15
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,380
I think your resignations
should be accepted immediately.

16
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,346
- Then why don't you?
- My mom says I can't.

17
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:41,058
You have to keep trying.
Tomorrow's too late.

18
00:00:41,091 --> 00:00:45,095
You think I'm not firing you because
it would make me look bad?

19
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,035
Give me a break, Billy.
It's not like you're indifferent.

20
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:48,615
You're fired,
end of the broadcast.

21
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,470
<i>Please don't tell anyone.</i>

<i>We're just past 9:00 P.M. in the East</i>

24
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:07,069

25

26

<i>the great state of Kansas

27
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,024
Moving south to Louisiana,
we project...

28
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:17,136
I'm here.

29
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,214
I want to make sure
there's absolutely no confusion.

30
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:22,818
You would go on the record.
We would use your name.

31
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:27,093
<i>I want more.
I want a quote.</i>

32
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:28,526
I'm gonna handcuff you
to this thing.

33
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,970
Did he just say,
"A big prize but no surprise"?

34
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:32,575
Yeah.

35
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:34,685
He'll be kicking
himself for that.

36
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:36,520
All right, well,
we've got a decision to make here

37
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:38,353
and I'll give you
a heads up either way.

38
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:40,962
Thank you
and good luck tonight.

39
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,997
It's as confirmed
as anything has ever been.

40
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,072
Two GOP congressmen
we can quote and identify,

41
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:48,747
two senior DOJ sources we can identify
as two senior DOJ sources.

42
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,877
- You wanted me?
- Yeah.

43
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:51,554
- All right, I can explain.
- Nope.

44
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:52,924
- Oh.
- Explain what?

45
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:54,665
Doesn't matter.

46
00:02:54,698 --> 00:02:57,569
Here's what's happening.
Brody in California

47
00:02:57,602 --> 00:03:00,403
made a statement this morning
when the polls opened condemning Todd Akin.

48
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:01,804
It's a tight race.

49
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:04,016
We figure he saw
internal numbers suggesting

50
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,422
he needed a bigger cushion
with women 18-55.

51
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:09,422
So he went on a local morning show
and slid in a condemnation of Akin,

52
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,633
but two hours ago,
Maggie found a Brody quote

53
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:15,839
in a Students for America
publication from 1990.

54
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:17,644
"It's a sad fact,
but women cry rape

55
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:20,980
to avoid embarrassment, to exact revenge,
or just to draw attention.

56
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:23,389
If we have rape exceptions
to abortion laws,

57
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:26,160
women could now cry rape
to terminate an innocent life.

58
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:28,333
We should be able to look
past the mendacity.

59
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,734
Children are conceived by love,
not by rape."

60
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,975
- How did you find that?
- Prayer and clean living.

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,874
- Seriously, how did you find that?
- It's my job.

62
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:36,211
It's my job, too,
but I didn't find that.

63
00:03:36,244 --> 00:03:37,855
- No, you didn't.
<i>- Knock it off.</i>

64
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:40,888
So, Don calls Brody's chief of staff
to get a comment.

65
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,793
- John Webb.
- And Webb says...

66
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:44,898
Given a little time,
he might be able to feed us a better story

67
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,902
in exchange for holding the SFA quote
till after the election.

68
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,071
What's the better story?

69
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:51,175
David Petraeus is going
to resign on Thursday.

70
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,009
He's been having an affair
with a lieutenant colonel in the Reserves.

71
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,286
So the question is
which story do we run?

72
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,654
- 'Cause it's one or the other.
- It's not even a contest.

73
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:01,821
- Brody.
- Petraeus. Wait.

74
00:04:01,862 --> 00:04:03,862
It's 6:00 in the West.
The polls are still open.

75
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,328
People are coming home
from work.

76
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:07,667
Almost 40% of the votes
in Brody's district

77
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:09,036
are cast between
5:00 and 8:00.

78
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:10,708
<i>I know,
and I fully appreciate that.</i>

79
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,540
- <i>But this is a special circumstance.</i> 
<i>- No, it's not.</i>

80
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:13,845
Let me make my case.

81
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,449
We're under siege.
If we break this Petraeus story

82
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:19,557
two days before everyone else, we'll one:
Distract from our own problems,

83
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,127
and two: Earn us back some
credibility and goodwill.

84
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,198
Does the Petraeus story
provide any information

85
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,631
the voters should have
before they punch a ballot?

86
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:28,368
It does not.

87
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,936
Does it do anyone any good

88
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,212
if we report the Brody quote
tomorrow instead of tonight?

89
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:34,778
It would help Brody out.

90
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:37,206
Call your guy back and tell him thanks,
but no, thanks.

91
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,349
We'll report that Petraeus is resigning
when Petraeus resigns, right?

92
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,213
- Yeah.
- Don?

93
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:45,488
I'm agreeing.
Do I have to be happy about it?

94
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,120
Put the Brody package
together for me to approve.

95
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,357
I want to get it
on the air in 15 minutes.

96
00:04:57,094 --> 00:05:00,826
- Everything all right?
- Hmm? Yeah.

97
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,970
<i>Here's how things
are looking right now</i>

98
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:06,739
just after
the 9:00 P.M. closings.

99
00:05:06,772 --> 00:05:09,806
Governor Romney is ahead
with 152 electoral votes

100
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:11,645
<i>to the president's 123.</i>

101
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:14,412
<i>No projections right now in Arizona,
New Mexico...</i>

102
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:17,347
They've run out of ballots
in Racine, Wisconsin.

103
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,819
Elliot's got it
and then throw to DC.

104
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,589
Elliot, right now President Obama
has a lead in Wisconsin,

105
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,989
but we're hearing
there are voting problems.

106
00:05:25,022 --> 00:05:27,261
Yeah, they've run out of ballots
in Racine, Wisconsin.

107
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,398
They've got to get some sort
of last-minute ballot supply.

108
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,969
Taylor Warren, is that a good sign
for the president in Wisconsin?

109
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:35,475
It's a very good sign. Racine,
the whole Rust Belt area of the state

110
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,338
is a very big sweet spot
for the president.

111
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,178
Coming to you, Jane.
Start us off with Colorado.

112
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,844
We're gonna start with Florida.

113
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,284
Take Jane to Florida.

114
00:05:44,317 --> 00:05:47,221
Let's bring in Jane Barrow
and our panel in DC.

115
00:05:47,254 --> 00:05:49,789
Jane, what are you guys
seeing in Florida?

116
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:52,996
There's an interesting dynamic
in that battleground state right now

117
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,827
and I'd like to go
to our panel.

118
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,393
All right, New York's
on an eight-minute break.

119
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:58,727
- Don't anyone go too far.
<i>- And clear.</i>

120
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,695
Okay, whew.

121
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,599
All right, turn out, turn out.

122
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:05,539
- The ground game.
- You talking to me?

123
00:06:06,067 --> 00:06:08,475
I wasn't really
talking to anyone.

124
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:10,645
I think you just described
the rest of my life.

125
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:14,579
How are you doing?

126
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:17,617
A group called Stand By Our Troops
submitted a petition

127
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,647
to AWM demanding
Charlie and I be fired.

128
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,015
They got 20,000 signatures.

129
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,954
- <i>Six and a half times the size of my hometown.</i>
- I saw.

130
00:06:24,987 --> 00:06:27,889
Another group
called Concerned Citizens for Truth

131
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:30,095
got 50,000 signatures.

132
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,724
We hired a polling firm
to gauge trust.

133
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:34,395
- And?
- Nobody trusts us.

134
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:37,995
Men, women, over 49, under 49,
Republicans, Democrats--

135
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:40,563
our lack of credibility
is immune to demographics.

136
00:06:40,596 --> 00:06:43,170
The op-eds won't stop.
They're getting worse.

137
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:47,032
And I'm concerned this is finally
what's going to kill Charlie Skinner.

138
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,838
Schadenfreude's been made
very convenient.

139
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:51,730
Hmm. Yeah.

140
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:56,571
You know,
I hate to seem like I'm circling,

141
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:58,876
but I'm setting up
a media consulting firm

142
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:01,613
and I wanted to get your blessing
to approach Jim Harper.

143
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:04,649
- About what?
- About joining the firm.

144
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:07,986
He hates me, but if I only worked
with people who liked me,

145
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:10,421
I'd have to make
my dog Howard a partner.

146
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:11,989
I'm lost.

147
00:07:12,022 --> 00:07:15,553
There's gonna be a land rush
as soon as you guys announce.

148
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:17,458
There's a lot of talent here.

149
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:20,363
Jim just renewed his contract
a few months ago.

150
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:22,897
It's in the air supply
around here

151
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,934
that senior staff
is resigning over Genoa.

152
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,231
Charlie is resigning
and I'm resigning.

153
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:29,601
But as of 1:35
this morning,

154
00:07:29,642 --> 00:07:32,410
Leona Lansing won't even
accept our resignations.

155
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:34,575
Where did you hear
senior staff was resigning?

156
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:37,140
- Maybe I shouldn't say.
- Where did you hear that?

157
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:40,244
From the senior staff.

158
00:07:45,285 --> 00:07:47,316
I make friends everywhere I go.

159
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:51,686
I want the senior staff
in the studio right now.

160
00:07:51,727 --> 00:07:53,991
- We have seven minutes back.
- Right now.

161
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:59,662
The mood here is still upbeat.
They like the internal exits they're seeing.

162
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:03,105
They're not troubled that Obama isn't losing
in a single state he needs to win?

163
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:05,906
- They like what they're seeing in Ohio and Florida.
- What are they seeing?

164
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:08,113
Honey, I'm starting to get
funny looks from people here.

165
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:10,945
- They know I'm Skyping with ACN.
- You're Skyping with me.

166
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:12,713
No one can see or hear us.

167
00:08:12,746 --> 00:08:14,344
- Hey, Hallie!
- Hey, Maggie.

168
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,551
Will wants senior staff
in the studio.

169
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,612
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

170
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:21,748
<i>It's mostly the bloggers who
don't want me helping out old media.</i>

171
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,454
You know, why don't you tell
new media that old media

172
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,623
has got a combined audience
of about 80 million tonight?

173
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:29,458
I will, but new media will
probably respond by saying

174
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:31,592
that the report you just gave
about Racine, Wisconsin,

175
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,056
running out of ballots
came off Twitter.

176
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,667
Then you should reply
by telling new media to bite me

177
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,165
and my accountability
and professionalism.

178
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:39,133
Can you get someone
else to do this?

179
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:42,003
By the way, a little while ago
we called the Michigan first for Dan Benishek.

180
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:44,769
If you were thinking of
posting something about it, I'd hold off.

181
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,810
- Why?
- I accidentally called the wrong race.

182
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:48,674
- I meant Mississippi.
- You didn't retract it?

183
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:51,209
Our decision desk
is 100% confident he's going to win.

184
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:53,314
- <i>Then why can't you call it?</i>
- They're not confident enough.

185
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:54,586
You should really retract it.

186
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,080
If you were us tonight,
would you retract something

187
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:57,847
you didn't absolutely have to?

188
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,183
- No.
- I'm going all in on Benishek.

189
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:01,885
- Hang on.
- They're waiting for me in the studio.

190
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:03,820
I think she cut her own hair.

191
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:07,218
Tonight's really
not the night--

192
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:10,125
Cutting off your own hair--
That's alarming.

193
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:15,228
Any chance this can wait?

194
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:16,963
- No.
- Jim's on his way.

195
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:18,763
I'd like to announce
something in the meantime.

196
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:22,374
I was supposed to donate a signed copy
of my book for the Sandy auction

197
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:25,711
and I went to see my parents last weekend
and forgot to leave the book.

198
00:09:25,744 --> 00:09:28,511
Gary, meaning well,
signed a copy of the book

199
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:30,382
forging my signature
and writing the inscription.

200
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:31,982
- In German.
- Almost.

201
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:34,181
In German the words for enjoy
and shred are a lot alike.

202
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:35,719
They're nothing alike,
but that's not the point.

203
00:09:35,752 --> 00:09:37,655
Take your time getting to the point,
because as you can see,

204
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:39,925
- nothing else is happening right now.
- We've got five minutes.

205
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,787
We do not have five minutes.
The producers don't have five minutes.

206
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:45,397
My point is that someone
bought the book for a lot of money

207
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,933
and Neal's dropping everything
to help me find out who it was

208
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:51,435
so that I can give him or her
a real signed copy of the book.

209
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:54,338
So if there's anyone
who was at the fund-raiser

210
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:56,771
- or maybe knows the person who--
- Excuse me.

211
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,771
You're dropping everything?

212
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:01,810
No, I'm still very much doing my job.
Except for right now.

213
00:10:01,843 --> 00:10:04,209
And when I'm trying to fix
your Wikipedia page.

214
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:06,449
Oh, forget that.
Drop it, it's stupid.

215
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:08,649
- Everybody's here?
- Yes.

216
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:11,613
Let's go around the room and everybody
tell something about themselves.

217
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:13,612
- Do you need to go back to the control room?
- Yes.

218
00:10:13,653 --> 00:10:15,653
Go.

219
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,023
- Fix the page. Get it fixed.
- Copy.

220
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:21,897
I don't know what the hell you guys
are thinking about doing,

221
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,495
but you're not doing it.

222
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:26,030
Last night, Charlie, Mac, and I

223
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:27,768
offered our resignations
to Mrs. Lansing.

224
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:31,535
She refused to accept them,
believing that the right thing to do was to stand by us.

225
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:34,976
Charlie is working hard on Reese
to get him to change his mother's mind.

226
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,681
The reason, whole reason,
we're trying to resign

227
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:40,178
is to allow the rest of you
to continue

228
00:10:40,219 --> 00:10:42,987
<i>to do what we started
without the burden of Genoa.</i>

229
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,851
Elliot would take my job.
Don would take Mac's.

230
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:48,357
Sloan would anchor 10:00
and Jim would be her EP.

231
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,198
So I don't want to hear
any more rumors

232
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:52,493
about the rest
of you resigning.

233
00:10:52,534 --> 00:10:54,061
- Is that clear?
- No.

234
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:55,827
- It's not clear?
- No, it's clear.

235
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:58,162
- We're saying no.
- No to what?

236
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:00,632
If Leona accepts your resignations,
we're resigning, too.

237
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:02,306
<i>Everyone who was
involved with Genoa.</i>

238
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,202
I'm not going accept
your resignations.

239
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:07,176
Due respect, but if Leona accepts yours,
you're not going to be in a position--

240
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,574
We gave you a bad story.
It's our responsibility.

241
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:12,339
There are principles of...
principle here

242
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,243
and character
and responsibility.

243
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:15,842
Who put all this in your head?

244
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,642
<i>- You did.
- Now can we go back to work?</i>

245
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:25,586
You expect me to get choked up?

246
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,050
Meeting's over.
Two minutes back.

247
00:11:38,727 --> 00:11:40,726
I think you insulted them a little
by not assuming

248
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,734
they'd stand behind you
and Charlie and Mac.

249
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:43,966
Why do you think that?

250
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,901
Because you
insulted me a little.

251
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,600
- Charlie. Hi.
- Oh, hi.

252
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:54,272
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Charlie.

253
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,537
Charlie,
a woman in Mesa, Arizona,

254
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:59,681
ran over her husband with their car
because he didn't vote for Romney.

255
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:01,944
- Can I have a moment?
- Did you hear what I just said?

256
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:03,581
- No.
- He's in the hospital.

257
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:06,412
They were in a parking lot.
She was chasing him around a light pole.

258
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:10,021
He tried to make a run for it
and she pinned him at the curb.

259
00:12:10,054 --> 00:12:12,621
Here's what I find
strange about this.

260
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:16,622
First of all,
it's not like the husband voted for Obama.

261
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:18,990
He just didn't vote for Romney.
He didn't vote.

262
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,093
And second,
isn't Romney gonna win the vote

263
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,829
in Arizona by like 200% anyway?

264
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:25,069
Yeah, but you don't think
the strange part

265
00:12:25,102 --> 00:12:28,204
is the wife driving over
her husband with a car?

266
00:12:28,237 --> 00:12:29,500
Well, she's pregnant.

267
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,401
- Where are you getting this from?
- Twitter.

268
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:35,103
All right,
can I have just a second?

269
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:36,805
Sure.

270
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:40,340
A decision has to be made
before the court clerk's office

271
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,443
opens at 9:00 tomorrow.

272
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:45,010
I appreciate everything
you said last night.

273
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:47,844
- I was high last night.
- I know. You told us.

274
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,179
But then I got
a good night's sleep

275
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:51,378
and an early morning swim
and a full day's work.

276
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:54,081
And then I changed and came here
and got high again.

277
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:55,682
- God damn it.
- It's marketing.

278
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:57,219
They got a stash.

279
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:58,661
I mean, I don't know
how they do it.

280
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,190
I think they grow their own

281
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:02,461
in, like, the Galapagos
Islands or something.

282
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:05,361
And I want to get
the Allman Brothers back together.

283
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:08,800
Rebecca says that it's your intention
to sue us if we resign.

284
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,233
For breach of contract, yes.
Hey, you want some champagne?

285
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:15,002
No. For two months, there's been a mob
shouting for our resignations.

286
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,472
- And the mob is right.
- Are you sure they're not just loud?

287
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,469
What does it matter? They'll keep shouting
until Will and I leave the building.

288
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,004
And if we don't leave the building,
what will that do to everyone else?

289
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:27,107
From what I understand,
if I accept your resignations,

290
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:29,810
there won't be anyone left
except the DC bureau

291
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,248
because those guys
want your jobs.

292
00:13:32,281 --> 00:13:34,781
Will and I will convince
senior staff to stay.

293
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,244
I'm not worried about that.

294
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:39,252
Here's why you have
to let Dantana's lawyers

295
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,549
know you're gonna settle
before papers are filed in the morning.

296
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,483
A diary will be made available
to any reporter who wants to read it...

297
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,786
- Which will be every reporter.
- ...of the internal operations of ACN.

298
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:51,058
And AWM and that diary
will be written by lawyers

299
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,194
whose only objective
is to make us look silly.

300
00:13:53,227 --> 00:13:55,963
I don't feel silly.
You want to split a pizza?

301
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:57,638
Can you understand me
right now?!

302
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,838
Well, when you speak at that volume,
I think everyone can.

303
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,571
I drove them into
this fucking nightmare.

304
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:04,505
I led, they followed.

305
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,737
And it's like I led
them to Cape Fear

306
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:09,348
'cause everyone
we've pissed off--

307
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,747
every congressman,
every reporter,

308
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,986
- every citizen journalist--
- I understand the reality.

309
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:18,153
You know who I am.

310
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:20,686
Reese agrees with us.

311
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:24,557
Oh, the irony that it's come down to
you and Reese agreeing.

312
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,292
- Your son and I seldom agree.
- You disrespect him, Charlie.

313
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:31,229
- He's given me reasons to.
- No, no, he hasn't.

314
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:32,933
He's given you reasons
to disagree with him,

315
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,258
but not to disrespect him.

316
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,665
Well, we're not
disagreeing now.

317
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:38,127
He's thinking
very clearly about this.

318
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,325
He's being a smart executive.

319
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:43,102
And now is exactly
the right time to listen to him.

320
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,496
Well, I'm doing a lot more
than listening to him.

321
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,264
I'm letting him
make the decision.

322
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:55,103
- You are?
- Yeah.

323
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:58,176
- Leona, come on.
- Reese is making the decision.

324
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,041
He went out to take a walk.

325
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,677
- Why?
- Clear his head.

326
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,181
- I meant--
- Maybe get a panini.

327
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:06,547
I meant why are you letting
Reese make the decision?

328
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,146
'Cause I'm not really sure
Elizabeth Windsor

329
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:10,656
is the world's greatest mom.

330
00:15:10,684 --> 00:15:12,917
I mean, why doesn't she just
give her son the throne?

331
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,024
On the other hand,
I think being queen is what keeps her alive.

332
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:18,691
But doesn't she want to be alive
to see her son be king?

333
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:21,089
Except that
that's not how it works.

334
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:25,128
It's prince by birth,
king by death. Yet--

335
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:27,232
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about right now?

336
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,602
Don't think I do, no.

337
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:32,969
But I want to see
how Reese handles this.

338
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:35,333
He's already told us
how he's gonna--

339
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:37,005
Okay.

340
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,680
Okay.

341
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,082
I'm relieved.

342
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,353
I can tell.

343
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,797
Enjoy the party.

344
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:03,003
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

345
00:16:03,036 --> 00:16:05,205
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?

346
00:16:05,238 --> 00:16:07,044
- I'm sorry.
- It was my fault.

347
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:08,876
I wasn't looking.
Did I hurt you?

348
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:10,979
No, no, I'm fine.

349
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,842
Have we met?
You look familiar.

350
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,008
I'm Maggie Jordan's roommate.

351
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,376
- Sure.
- I'm Lisa.

352
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:18,383
Lisa.

353
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:21,216
I'm sorry, Lisa.
Are you all okay?

354
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,886
- Yes.
- Okay.

355
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,886
Oh, Mr. Skinner,
could I ask you a favor?

356
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,191
Would you mind not mentioning to Jim Harper
that I'm working up here tonight?

357
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,632
Yeah, sure.
Why would I mention it to Jim?

358
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:34,399
Oh, 'cause you guys were--
Got it.

359
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:36,566
Thank you.

360
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:39,997
We're ready to make
an important projection

361
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:42,732
at 9:25 with 27%
of the vote counted.

362
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,701
ACN is projecting
that Pennsylvania

363
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,508
will be won by the president.

364
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,675
<i>Pennsylvania,
a crucial battleground state</i>

365
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,977
which was won by the president
four years ago, will stay in his column.

366
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,945
Suzannah Marquez
is on the scene for us

367
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:55,743
at Obama headquarters
in Chicago.

368
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:57,875
<i>Suzannah, was this much
of a surprise where you are?</i>

369
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,010
<i>Will, they're not surprised,</i>

370
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:00,611
<i>but they're certainly relieved.</i>

371
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,583
<i>This was a state President Obama
was determined to hold</i>

372
00:17:03,616 --> 00:17:06,286
against a late push
from Governor Romney to take it.

373
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,715
There's also something
instructive in these numbers.

374
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:13,120
<i>According to senior campaign officials
I've been speaking to all day...</i>

375
00:17:13,153 --> 00:17:14,994
- It's not from you?
- Mm-mm.

376
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:17,262
<i>...was the high
African-American turnout.</i>

377
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:20,531
<i>And that's a pattern they said
they've been seeing in a number of states today.</i>

378
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:23,898
<i>But, of course, the night is early
and we'll have much more later.</i>

379
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,970
- Will?
- Thank you, Suzannah Marquez.

380
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,138
- <i>We'll be hearing more from you as the night moves on.</i>
- Battleground update.

381
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:31,506
Checking in with our
other battleground states--

382
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,641
in Florida with 84%
of the vote in,

383
00:17:33,674 --> 00:17:35,074
the race is as close as it gets

384
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:37,051
<i>with the president
holding a 50-49 lead.</i>

385
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:39,253
- <i>It looks like...</i>
- It's close.

386
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:40,518
Hit refresh.

387
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:43,190
It just got closer.

388
00:17:43,223 --> 00:17:45,527
657 votes.

389
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,400
- Kathy?
- Very busy now, Jim.

390
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:52,799
Can I see you one second?

391
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:54,964
- I'll have to shield my eyes.
- Go ahead.

392
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:58,801
I'm not allowed
to see other networks.

393
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:01,707
Just look down.
Aim your gaze at the floor.

394
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,172
The Michigan first
is getting tighter.

395
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:04,940
Benishek is only up
by 600 votes.

396
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,409
657.

397
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:08,808
There was a moment in the race
when it was 1-0, right?

398
00:18:08,841 --> 00:18:12,588
- That's not-- Yes, but--
- And then the second vote got counted.

399
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:14,115
- You're still confident he's going to win?
- Yes.

400
00:18:14,156 --> 00:18:17,385
- And you're just as confident he's going to win.
- 51-49 red.

401
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:19,288
- Or, if you want to be more exact...
- I do.

402
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:22,625
- 50.6 to 49.4.
- That's literally as close as a race can be.

403
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:24,362
- That's why we haven't called it.
- We did call it.

404
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,427
- You called it.
- What's the abbreviation for Michigan?

405
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:28,633
- MI.
- What's the abbreviation for Mississippi?

406
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:32,062
- MISS.
- Okay, you're not here as an abbreviation expert.

407
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm 100% confident
in those abbreviations.

408
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:36,104
Go back in your lair.

409
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:37,537
<i>- Jim.</i> 
- Yeah?

410
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:39,440
<i>Rachel Corey is on the phone
and wants to talk to you.</i>

411
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:42,077
She's a pollster with the Benishek campaign
in the Michigan first.

412
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:43,875
Here it comes.

413
00:18:43,908 --> 00:18:45,444
Tam, will you transfer
that call to Maggie's line?

414
00:18:45,477 --> 00:18:47,783
<i>Yeah.</i>

415
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:54,154
This is Jim Harper.

416
00:18:54,195 --> 00:18:57,625
<i>Jim, this is Rachel Corey
with Dan Benishek's campaign in Michigan.</i>

417
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:00,365
- Congratulations!
<i>- That's why I'm on the phone.</i>

418
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:03,405
<i>ACN called the race a while ago,
but no one else has.</i>

419
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:05,437
Well, I can't speak
for the other networks,

420
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,772
but ACN has the congressman
holding his seat.

421
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:10,011
<i>Our numbers show
he's only up by 600 votes.</i>

422
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:12,643
- 657.
- 632.

423
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:13,946
<i>What the hell is going on, Jim?</i>

424
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:16,282
<i>Do I send my guy out
to make a victory speech?</i>

425
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,883
I would.

426
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,589
<i>Look, I don't want to kick you guys
when you're down,</i>

427
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:24,526
<i>but you haven't had the most awesome
history of being right lately.</i>

428
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,762
Well, first, you can't bounce
the words history and lately

429
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:30,658
off each other
in the same sentence.

430
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:33,669
Also, in my entire time here
covering national elections,

431
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:35,269
ACN hasn't missed
a single call.

432
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:37,236
<i>How many elections
have you been there for?</i>

433
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:38,371
This is my second.

434
00:19:38,404 --> 00:19:41,001
- <i>Did we win the election or not?</i>
- You did.

435
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:42,809
<i>Then why has no one else
called it?</i>

436
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:45,644
You're forcing me to brag,
but it may just be

437
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:47,580
that we have better people
working the numbers.

438
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:50,683
<i>You won't be offended if we wait
until someone else has called it, will you?</i>

439
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:52,715
No, ma'am.
I am a little offended.

440
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:54,586
- Even though you're lying?
- She doesn't know that.

441
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,418
- We've got a problem upstairs.
- At the party?

442
00:19:56,451 --> 00:19:58,826
The guests were supposed
to hand over their phones and someone didn't,

443
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:00,961
because they tweeted a picture.

444
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:03,424
There are people up there who are hearing
information we don't want leaked.

445
00:20:03,457 --> 00:20:06,595
And also this is
a shot of Charlie

446
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,300
on the floor with
broken champagne glasses,

447
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,372
which isn't the best optic
for us right now.

448
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:13,074
- I don't have the muscle to get security to--
- That's Lisa.

449
00:20:14,603 --> 00:20:17,539
- Kneeling on the floor, that's Lisa.
- That is Lisa.

450
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:19,642
She didn't want you to know
she was here tonight.

451
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:22,606
She's been working for a caterer
to earn extra money.

452
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,708
Why didn't she want me
to know she was here?

453
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,351
This is where
I'm gonna check out.

454
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:30,919
But someone upstairs has a phone
and they're using it.

455
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:36,992
You know, it might be a good time
for you guys to patch things up.

456
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:38,728
You really think
this is a good time?

457
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,832
What if none of us
are here tomorrow?

458
00:20:46,598 --> 00:20:49,037
599.

459
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:53,005
Checking back in
with our analysts.

460
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,248
Taylor, you've been looking over the exits
and working your phone.

461
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:56,615
Tell us what you're
seeing and hearing.

462
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:58,614
We're seeing movement
in Florida.

463
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:01,714
The last exit polls showed
Mitt Romney up by three.

464
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:04,777
The latest show the president up by one.
So that's a fluid race.

465
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,020
But senior campaign
sources in Boston

466
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:08,853
are telling me they like
the precinct breakdown.

467
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:10,723
<i>The Romney people still
feeling good about Florida?</i>

468
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:12,259
- Take us to break.
<i>- Florida and Ohio.</i>

469
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:13,386
And hopefully we'll be able

470
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:14,921
to bring those calls
to you soon.

471
00:21:14,954 --> 00:21:17,024
But right now, what we know
is that Pennsylvania,

472
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:18,459
the first of
the big contested states...

473
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,594
- Play in and stand by animation.
- Standing.

474
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:23,065
<i>Stay tuned for more
of ACN's continuing coverage</i>

475
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:24,633
of Election Night 2012.

476
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,073
We're out.

477
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:30,442
- Two minutes back.
- That's two and no change.

478
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:33,042
Will, we're ready to call
the House for the Republicans.

479
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,672
All right, I'll take care
of things out here.

480
00:21:34,713 --> 00:21:36,805
- You do it in there.
- Take care of what things?

481
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:38,675
Come sit in this chair.

482
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,345
Why?

483
00:21:40,378 --> 00:21:42,672
When we come back from commercial,
you're gonna call the House

484
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:44,646
for the Republicans and go
to Sloan for the breakdown.

485
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,645
<i>- Where are you going?</i> 
<i>- I'm taking a break.</i>

486
00:21:46,678 --> 00:21:49,349
<i>What do you mean,
you're taking--</i>

487
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:51,752
I want our audience to get used to
seeing you break big news.

488
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:53,121
That's not gonna be necessary.

489
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,953
- Take the chair.
- No.

490
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:57,255
Then there's gonna be a camera
pointed at an empty chair.

491
00:21:57,288 --> 00:21:58,823
Oh, fuck. Will!

492
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:06,530
- Don.
- Yeah?

493
00:22:06,563 --> 00:22:08,426
We're gonna call the House
after the break.

494
00:22:08,467 --> 00:22:09,962
Yeah, we've got Boehner,
Cantor, and Pelosi,

495
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,761
but we have to wait in line for a while,
so you'll need to vamp.

496
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:14,097
You'll need to vamp.
I'm gonna step out of the room.

497
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:15,935
- 60 seconds back.
- What?

498
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,703
You've got your cards,
you've got your producers,

499
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,704
you've got Elliot at the desk.

500
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:21,577
What's happening right now?

501
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,609
We just want to show Reese and Leona
you guys are good at this.

502
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,109
- You guys are good at this.
- See you in eight minutes.

503
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:31,281
The Republicans are keeping the House.
Let's get that graphic up.

504
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:33,455
- G-0445 standing.
- Elliot.

505
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:35,022
I'm here.

506
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:36,652
You're gonna ask Sloan
how we're able to make that call.

507
00:22:36,685 --> 00:22:39,653
- Copy.
<i>- Sloan, most of the competitive House races</i>

508
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:41,327
were in states where
polls closed at 8:00.

509
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,192
Republicans were ahead in 12,
Democrats in three,

510
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:45,327
and that's how
we're able to call it.

511
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:48,297
- You copy?
- This is getting out of hand.

512
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,993
Ah, don't worry about that
right now, okay?

513
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,529
Copy.

514
00:22:56,936 --> 00:22:58,532
<i>Welcome back.</i>

515
00:22:58,565 --> 00:23:00,964
<i>We are ready to make
a big call.</i>

516
00:23:01,037 --> 00:23:04,774
ACN's ready to project
that the Republican Party

517
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:07,373
will be the majority party
in the House of Representatives

518
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:08,812
for at least two more years.

519
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,179
So far, so good.

520
00:23:10,212 --> 00:23:12,842
<i>ACN is projecting at this time
that the Republicans</i>

521
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:15,114
<i>will hold on to
the majority of the House.</i>

522
00:23:15,147 --> 00:23:17,478
<i>We'll be speaking with
Majority Leader Eric Cantor in just a moment.</i>

523
00:23:17,511 --> 00:23:19,781
<i>But before we do,
Sloan Sabbith,</i>

524
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:21,283
<i>you've been reviewing
all the information</i>

525
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,547
<i>as far as the House
is concerned.</i>

526
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,052
<i>You've been speaking
with our decision desk.</i>

527
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:25,452
<i>How are we able to call this?</i>

528
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:26,756
<i>Well, Elliot,
the Democrats</i>

529
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:29,753
<i>needed a net gain of 25 seats
to take the House</i>

530
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:32,592
<i>and 20 of the most competitive
races closed at 8:00.</i>

531
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,194
I was wrong to think the reason
you weren't firing me was vanity.

532
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,356
I was wrong to think the reason

533
00:23:41,397 --> 00:23:43,363
you weren't firing me
was that it would look bad.

534
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:45,997
I'm sorry for that.

535
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,703
You want your job back?

536
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:53,107
I don't think it'll make
that much difference now.

537
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,938
Charlie told me Leona
is letting Reese make the decision.

538
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:58,180
Yeah.

539
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,646
I tried to explain it

540
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:03,452
my first day here
the second I saw you.

541
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,051
Do you remember?

542
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:07,681
I was hung up on him
because he had rejected me.

543
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:10,087
That's normal.

544
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,221
I liked that he hated
I was dating you.

545
00:24:12,254 --> 00:24:13,780
We weren't just dating.

546
00:24:13,822 --> 00:24:15,620
Later. We weren't
just dating later.

547
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:17,987
At the beginning we were,
though.

548
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,430
And I was using you to get,

549
00:24:21,463 --> 00:24:23,325
you know.

550
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,562
And then I fell
in love with you

551
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:28,358
and I never saw him again.

552
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:31,825
And if I hadn't told you,

553
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:33,593
you'd never have known.

554
00:24:34,562 --> 00:24:36,032
So why did you tell me?

555
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,632
If I had to do it over again,
I wouldn't,

556
00:24:37,665 --> 00:24:41,290
but I had never been in a relationship
as serious as ours

557
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:43,266
and I thought it was
what I was supposed to do.

558
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:45,467
You sure you didn't tell me
'cause you wanted to break up?

559
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,235
Oh, fuck you.

560
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,866
- It's a reasonable--
- Yeah, I'm sure.

561
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:51,671
Are you sure you're not
just a massive bag of douche?

562
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:54,234
'Cause let me tell you something,
it's just plain weird

563
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:56,299
that you were prepared
to marry me,

564
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,708
that you'd bought a ring,

565
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:01,008
but were unwilling
to read any of my e-mails

566
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:02,583
or answer any of my calls.

567
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:06,312
Yeah, I'm sorry for this,
but the ring was a practical joke.

568
00:25:06,345 --> 00:25:09,175
You were having the staff vet me,
remember?

569
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,815
I knew you were gonna find the offer
from when we were together

570
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:13,480
for me to do something
on the West Coast.

571
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:16,214
I knew you were gonna come into the office
waving it and saying,

572
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:17,884
"Aha, you were never
as serious as you said,

573
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:20,115
'cause if you were,
you'd have told me about a job

574
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:22,387
you were considering
on the other side of the country."

575
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,257
And that's what happened.

576
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:30,494
You know, I heard,
"The ring was a practical joke..."

577
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:34,662
and then I didn't hear
anything after that.

578
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:37,165
It wasn't a joke.
It was a rejoinder. It wasn't a joke.

579
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:39,395
You took out a ring
and showed it to me

580
00:25:39,428 --> 00:25:42,562
as proof that your intention
had been to marry me.

581
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:43,866
I bought the ring that morning.

582
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:46,799
Scott's assistant did.

583
00:25:48,334 --> 00:25:51,375
Your agent's assistant
went to Tiffany's

584
00:25:51,408 --> 00:25:52,903
and bought the ring
that morning?

585
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:55,007
Yes. I'm sorry.
And you were never supposed to know.

586
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,878
So I get the irony
and I am really sorry.

587
00:25:57,911 --> 00:26:01,417
That ring had to have cost
a quarter of a million dollars.

588
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,321
I'm not really sure.

589
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,655
We returned it that afternoon.

590
00:26:05,688 --> 00:26:07,853
I asked them to get a nice one.

591
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:09,820
You once described a ring
you saw in a movie.

592
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:11,388
- Okay.
- Mac.

593
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:13,091
You know, no kidding.
I'm gonna step away.

594
00:26:13,124 --> 00:26:14,722
- Hang on.
- Because the thing is I'm serious.

595
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:16,920
I feel like I'm gonna hit you
and you have to be back on the air.

596
00:26:16,961 --> 00:26:18,959
- You're not going to hit me.
- I'm worried that I am.

597
00:26:18,992 --> 00:26:20,661
And I'm the executive
producer of the show.

598
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:22,727
I can defend my--

599
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:26,598
Stand on the other side
of the room.

600
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:28,733
- This is stupid.
- There is a reasonable chance,

601
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:30,869
a credible threat
that I'm gonna hit you

602
00:26:30,903 --> 00:26:32,471
and I don't want you
to have a bloody lip

603
00:26:32,504 --> 00:26:33,944
when we come back
from commercial.

604
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:36,177
That should make sense to you.

605
00:26:39,113 --> 00:26:40,847
Like I said, if I ever thought

606
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,708
there was a chance
you'd find out...

607
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:44,515
You just told me!

608
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,518
I brutally hurt you
and that's a fact.

609
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:58,521
And facts don't change.
But in my lifetime...

610
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:03,357
I've never done it
intentionally.

611
00:27:07,663 --> 00:27:09,630
I'm sorry.

612
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,849
Recap the House and then
look at Colorado when we come back.

613
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:30,655
Yeah.

614
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:37,396
- Did you find out anything?
- Yes.

615
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:39,596
A woman at the auction
management company

616
00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:42,868
was moved by your story
and a little concerned about going to jail

617
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:45,763
for fraud, so she was happy to fax over
the name and contact information

618
00:27:45,804 --> 00:27:49,102
of the person who bought the forged book,
but you're not gonna be happy.

619
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,831
Was it bought by an inmate?

620
00:27:50,871 --> 00:27:53,807
I have a small, slightly disturbed following
among white-collar criminals.

621
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,773
The book was bought
by Sidney Falco.

622
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:58,836
- I don't know who that is.
- It's Tony Curtis.

623
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,241
Sidney Falco is a character
from <i>Sweet Smell of Success</i>.

624
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:03,473
The highest bid was anonymous?

625
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:04,704
All the bids are anonymous.

626
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:06,280
Joe Gillis is <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>.

627
00:28:06,313 --> 00:28:07,944
<i>Walter Neff from </i>Double Indemnity<i>.</i>

628
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,712
<i>Archibald Craven
from </i>The Secret Garden<i>.</i>

629
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:10,880
I don't understand this at all.

630
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:12,713
Someone wanted to create

631
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:14,617
the impression
of a bidding war.

632
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,886
So a total of nobody
bid on the book?

633
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,851
Except Sidney Falco from
<i>Sweet Smell of Success</i>

634
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:21,156
who, for some reason,
bid himself up with other fictional characters.

635
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:24,021
Who cares?
Someone gave $1,000 to Sandy relief

636
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:25,788
and they think they have
your signature.

637
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,562
- I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
- You're at the bottom.

638
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:29,059
- There are clues here.
- I don't think so.

639
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:30,363
- There could be clues.
- There aren't.

640
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:31,867
And you don't want to start
looking for anagrams--

641
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,701
Let's start looking for
anagrams of Sidney Falco

642
00:28:33,734 --> 00:28:35,806
and <i>Sweet Smell of Success</i>.

643
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,638
Okay.

644
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:42,939
I got your text.

645
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,779
- I've decided to counter-sue Jerry.
- Of course.

646
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:46,677
- I'm fighting back.
- What are you suing him for?

647
00:28:46,717 --> 00:28:49,055
- To fight back.
- I meant exactly what are you--

648
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:50,655
- You ready?
<i>- I'm sorry?</i>

649
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,256
- I said you ready?
- Give it to me.

650
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:54,690
Intentional affliction
of emotional distress.

651
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:56,463
- How do you even know?
- I Googled it.

652
00:28:56,496 --> 00:28:58,291
- There are four elements.
- One: He acted intentionally.

653
00:28:58,324 --> 00:29:01,563
- By doctoring the tape.
- Two: His conduct was extreme and outrageous.

654
00:29:01,596 --> 00:29:04,133
- He doctored the tape.
- Three: You suffered distress.

655
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,735
I am in extreme distress.

656
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:08,006
And four: His act
caused your distress.

657
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,172
He doctored
the motherfucking tape, Rebecca.

658
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:12,674
- You sound upset.
- Do I?

659
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:15,772
He doctored the tape
and he gets to sue us?

660
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:18,351
I gave him a bad job recommendation
'cause he doctored the tape

661
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:20,415
and he gets to sue me?

662
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:23,585
- The people who want tort reform, they got a point.
- Yes.

663
00:29:23,626 --> 00:29:25,922
The things you're allowed to sue for
and be taken seriously.

664
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:27,729
And so we come
face-to-face

665
00:29:27,762 --> 00:29:29,791
with just how stupid
lawyers worry we are.

666
00:29:29,824 --> 00:29:31,293
I lost you
in the middle of that.

667
00:29:31,326 --> 00:29:33,598
You know what it says
on a box of chocolate pudding mix?

668
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:36,434
"Caution, pudding
will get hot when heated."

669
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:39,108
Go to a hotel, you know what it says
on the shower cap in the bathroom?

670
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:41,211
"Fits one head."

671
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:43,475
- You wear a shower cap?
- I read.

672
00:29:43,508 --> 00:29:45,178
And I'm dying to know the suit

673
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:47,408
that prompted lawyers
to insist on the shower cap directions.

674
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,175
Look at the box
your iron came in.

675
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:52,351
It says, "Warning,
do not iron clothes while wearing them."

676
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:55,086
Do we really have to slow down
for these people?

677
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,749
Leona's leaving
the decision to Reese.

678
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:01,020
I know.

679
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:06,491
That's not what you wanted.

680
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,192
I don't know what I want.

681
00:30:18,935 --> 00:30:21,406
I want to keep doing the news.

682
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:23,573
Here.

683
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:25,709
With Elliot for Charlie.

684
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,676
I want to keep arguing
with Mac and Will.

685
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:30,274
I want Dantana to iron his clothes
while wearing them.

686
00:30:36,343 --> 00:30:38,908
Could I get another Grey Goose on the rocks
with three olives?

687
00:30:38,981 --> 00:30:40,580
- Sure.
- And you can just bring me some more champagne

688
00:30:40,613 --> 00:30:42,685
if it hasn't all been
soaked up by your clothes.

689
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,982
- No, there's plenty more.
- Just joking with you.

690
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:47,453
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

691
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,326
Don't shoot.

692
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,094
Charlie Skinner
wasn't supposed to tell you I was here.

693
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:56,598
He didn't. Someone tweeted
a picture of you on the floor.

694
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:59,302
The center of gravity
on champagne glasses is too high.

695
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:01,134
That's what I've always said.

696
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,436
And what happened
to the old-fashioned ones from the movies?

697
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:06,141
They're too wide. They let the bubbles out.
I'm working right now.

698
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:07,911
Yeah, Maggie said you were
working for a caterer.

699
00:31:07,944 --> 00:31:09,943
On the side.
I still work at the store.

700
00:31:09,976 --> 00:31:11,709
It was good seeing you.

701
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:14,875
I just have a minute.
We're waiting for some Senate information.

702
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,777
I think Sherrod Brown
is gonna keep his seat

703
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,947
and it's looking like
McCaskill's gonna beat Todd Akin.

704
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,516
- Do you know how frustrating this is?
- Careful.

705
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:22,156
I want to kick
your ass right now,

706
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:23,724
but I can't 'cause everyone else is.
There's no room.

707
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,494
So I have to feel bad
for you instead.

708
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:27,430
If those are the only choices,
I'd rather you kick my ass.

709
00:31:27,463 --> 00:31:29,401
- You don't get to decide. You know why?
- I do.

710
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:31,137
- Do you remember standing in front of me and swearing...
- Yes.

711
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,073
- <i>...swearing that you didn't have feelings--</i>
<i>- I meant it.</i>

712
00:31:33,106 --> 00:31:36,041
You know that I found out from
that fucking YouTube video, you asshole?

713
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:37,875
I don't think there's a way
it could have been worse.

714
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:41,149
- Excuse me, Lisa. Is there a problem?
- No.

715
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,449
It seems like there is because
you're speaking rudely to a guest.

716
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:46,111
- And the incident earlier, that man was the president--
- There's no problem.

717
00:31:46,152 --> 00:31:48,217
And considering the circumstances,
she's being remarkably polite.

718
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,153
On the other hand,
one of your servers is tweeting pictures

719
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:53,226
from the party and you signed
a confidentiality agreement.

720
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,963
Well, if that's true,
it's serious.

721
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,257
- It is.
- I'll take care of it.

722
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:58,592
- Lisa, please be working.
- I'm coming now.

723
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,632
How do you know
it was one of the servers?

724
00:32:00,665 --> 00:32:02,032
- It probably wasn't.
- I have to go.

725
00:32:02,065 --> 00:32:05,370
I meant it.
When I stood in front of you

726
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:07,043
and when I swore, I meant it.

727
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:08,476
- I believe you.
- Do you?

728
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,177
Yes, it wasn't till after you got to know me
that you rejected me.

729
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:13,344
- Champagne?
- No, thank you, I'm good.

730
00:32:13,377 --> 00:32:15,049
I didn't reject you.

731
00:32:15,082 --> 00:32:17,420
And there isn't a way
it could have been worse.

732
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:20,421
Grey Goose up, three olives.

733
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:22,691
Because at that point,
my worst fear was realized.

734
00:32:22,724 --> 00:32:25,325
- Spiders?
- You get a kick out of yourself, don't you?

735
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:27,599
I actually ordered this
on the rocks.

736
00:32:27,632 --> 00:32:29,136
My fault.
I'll fix that.

737
00:32:29,168 --> 00:32:31,501
She got the number of olives right.
She's making progress.

738
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,699
- What was that?
- I beg your pardon?

739
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:35,570
Jim.

740
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:38,140
- I don't know what your worst fear is.
- That you think I'm stupid.

741
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:39,974
And stop trying to make up
for it by defending my honor

742
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:41,573
to a guy you can obviously
beat the shit out of.

743
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:43,309
- Stop.
- I can't.

744
00:32:43,342 --> 00:32:45,213
Do you think I think
you're stupid?

745
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:47,180
- I have to circulate.
- The whole time you thought--

746
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:49,219
I'm smart enough to know
that I'm not smart enough.

747
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:50,482
- For what?
- You.

748
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:52,081
- Stop walking.
- Can we drop it?

749
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:54,247
Lisa.

750
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:57,258
- I don't get you.
- Maggie is downstairs being a news producer.

751
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,092
Your new girlfriend's
in Boston covering

752
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,933
a presidential candidate
for her own website.

753
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:02,860
And I'm up here passing out drinks.
What evidence--

754
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:04,466
You're working two jobs.

755
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,603
You're thoughtful
and you're authentic.

756
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:09,838
And I have never seen you
sneer at anyone or anything.

757
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:13,009
There is, believe me,
no one that you're not good enough for

758
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,446
and there is hardly anyone
who's good enough for you,

759
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,510
including, it turned out, me.

760
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,150
I'm about to turn 30.

761
00:33:19,183 --> 00:33:20,950
And you could just as easily
be someone's date here tonight

762
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:22,454
or married
to their black Am Ex.

763
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:25,516
If they can make me laugh,
I'd take a green one.

764
00:33:25,557 --> 00:33:27,554
Did Maggie cut her own hair?

765
00:33:27,587 --> 00:33:29,620
- I don't speak to Maggie.
- You live in the same apartment.

766
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:31,629
We have our own lives.
Champagne?

767
00:33:31,662 --> 00:33:33,261
Strictly speaking,
champagne should be poured

768
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:34,996
immediately after
the bottle's been uncorked,

769
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:36,866
but because you're very beautiful,
I'll make an exception.

770
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:38,728
Yeah, yeah.
Take the glass.

771
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:42,066
- Maggie's in bad shape.
- I don't care.

772
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:44,108
- I don't speak to Maggie.
- Please change that policy.

773
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:45,477
- No.
- She's in bad shape.

774
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,141
Because you're dating
that reporter from the bus?

775
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:49,107
- It's hard for me to sympathize.
- Not because of me.

776
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,778
- Because of Africa.
- What do you mean?

777
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:53,548
I don't care.
Champagne?

778
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:55,422
They don't want champagne.

779
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:58,452
Are you saying Maggie didn't tell you
what happened in Uganda?

780
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:02,122
No. And again,
I don't care.

781
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:03,523
Did she get hurt?

782
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:04,956
Did somebody--
What are you saying?

783
00:34:04,997 --> 00:34:07,060
You have to ask her.

784
00:34:07,093 --> 00:34:09,132
I can't tell you
if she doesn't want you to know.

785
00:34:09,165 --> 00:34:11,968
But she wants you to know,
so you have to ask her.

786
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,840
No.

787
00:34:16,113 --> 00:34:18,440
Did she cut her own hair off?

788
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,816
There was hair
on the bathroom floor.

789
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:25,816
We're gonna make the Senate call
in Missouri and Ohio

790
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:28,858
and we'll be throwing it to DC
in 10 or 11 minutes.

791
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:30,354
- Copy.
- But if we're able to call Florida,

792
00:34:30,395 --> 00:34:33,163
or for that matter, the race,
just send it back.

793
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:36,436
You're not gonna let
DC call the race?

794
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,404
Just send it back.

795
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:41,604
We'll try not to drop
sarin gas on anyone while we do.

796
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:48,944
If you've got something to say, Jane,
you should say it to me

797
00:34:48,977 --> 00:34:50,681
and not to the people
in this control room

798
00:34:50,714 --> 00:34:53,009
who simply did what
I told them to do and did it well.

799
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,381
And I have people here who could live
without Genoa on their resumes,

800
00:34:55,414 --> 00:34:59,180
<i>so I'm not sure from where you get
the nerve to insist that Will call the race.</i>

801
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:00,612
I get the nerve from my mother.

802
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:02,788
But for the record,
it was a DC producer

803
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:04,587
<i>who committed
journalistic malpractice.</i>

804
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,888
And if I were you,
I'd be going through every story

805
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:08,952
he ever produced for you
frame by frame

806
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:10,794
to find out what else
he's cooked along the way.

807
00:35:10,829 --> 00:35:13,657
Good advice. Let me know
if you have any recommendations

808
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,262
for your job
when I take Will's chair in New York.

809
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:18,892
It's Charlie Skinner, Jane.

810
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:21,894
<i>Send it back to New York
when Mac tells you to.</i>

811
00:35:21,935 --> 00:35:24,627
- Copy that.
- The desk says go on Senate.

812
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:27,565
We're ready to go on the Senate.
McCaskill and Brown.

813
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:29,829
Because this is something
that needs to be kept in mind.

814
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:33,399
- The entire world--
- Sorry, we're gonna make an important call.

815
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:35,238
Two big races in the US Senate.

816
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:38,373
ACN is projecting that in Ohio,
Sherrod Brown,

817
00:35:38,406 --> 00:35:40,476
the Democratic incumbent,
will be reelected

818
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:42,708
and Claire McCaskill,
the Democrat from Missouri,

819
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,780
will keep her seat as well.

820
00:35:44,845 --> 00:35:46,276
<i>Elliot, what does that mean
for the Senate?</i>

821
00:35:46,317 --> 00:35:48,749
<i>It's now
mathematically impossible</i>

822
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:50,452
for the Republicans
to take control of the Senate,

823
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:53,353
even if Romney wins tonight
and Paul Ryan becomes the tiebreaker.

824
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:55,648
So we're projecting now
that Harry Reid

825
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:57,521
will stay in the majority
leader's office.

826
00:35:57,554 --> 00:35:59,826
Taylor, should the Democrats
be sending the Tea Party

827
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:03,190
a basket of mini muffins
and a thank-you card for that?

828
00:36:03,223 --> 00:36:06,787
I think the Democrats
have a lot of gift baskets to hand out.

829
00:36:06,828 --> 00:36:08,798
Chris Christie,
the media--

830
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:10,863
- Whoa.
- Okay. Hold the phone.

831
00:36:10,896 --> 00:36:12,303
I can feel warmth
about to happen.

832
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,302
What media are you talking about
when you say media?

833
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:16,501
- 'Cause there are a lot of us. ACN?
- Yes.

834
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:18,403
Ah, well.
Please continue.

835
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:20,067
I worked in
the Romney press shop

836
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:22,875
and I can tell you that on average
over the last six months,

837
00:36:22,908 --> 00:36:25,875
<i>News Night</i> did
14 negative stories

838
00:36:25,908 --> 00:36:26,915
about Republicans
to every one...

839
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:28,083
Hey, Molly.
It's New York.

840
00:36:28,116 --> 00:36:30,054
- Copy.
<i>- Coming to you shortly. Stand by.</i>

841
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,023
If Republicans do
14 crazy things in a month,

842
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,486
does that mean
the unbiased thing to do

843
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:36,958
would be for us to concoct
13 additional crazy Democrat stories?

844
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:38,790
- Are we doing this now?
<i>- We're doing this.</i>

845
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:41,198
- Go to Molly in St. Louis.
- Then let me give you another statistic.

846
00:36:41,231 --> 00:36:44,232
- Almost nobody--
- No, we're going to St. Louis first.

847
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:47,001
- Okay.
- Molly Sadler is with the McCaskill campaign

848
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:48,673
at the Omni Convention Center.

849
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,873
Molly, do I have to ask
what the mood is there?

850
00:36:50,906 --> 00:36:53,610
I would say the mood
is jubilation, Will.

851
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:09,796
Is there a chance I can get you
to ask Hallie a favor for me?

852
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:12,836
- What's the favor?
- I need her to post a story tonight.

853
00:37:12,869 --> 00:37:15,471
Which I've already written--
About the effect the debates had on the outcome.

854
00:37:15,504 --> 00:37:18,112
In this story she quotes Mac,
who's identified

855
00:37:18,145 --> 00:37:19,806
both as the EP of <i>News Night</i>

856
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:21,813
and a former president
of the Cambridge Union.

857
00:37:21,846 --> 00:37:25,014
That's the only way
to get Wikipedia to change the entry?

858
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:28,586
- Yeah.
- Are you proud of your army of citizen journalists?

859
00:37:28,659 --> 00:37:30,625
Have you called any more
elections on your own?

860
00:37:30,658 --> 00:37:32,120
- No.
- Just the one?

861
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:34,560
I'll ask her.
But, you know, she's a little busy.

862
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:35,929
And ethical.

863
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:38,766
I'd like to do this
for Mac tonight as a gift.

864
00:37:40,808 --> 00:37:43,805
I'll do it
when I have a minute.

865
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:45,573
The left doesn't have
a version of the Tea Party.

866
00:37:45,606 --> 00:37:46,942
What's OWS?

867
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:49,312
There wasn't an OWS candidate
on the ballot tonight.

868
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:51,753
The left's crazy people
hardly ever run for office.

869
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:53,416
And when they do,
they don't win.

870
00:37:53,457 --> 00:37:54,854
Who's Allen West on the left?

871
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:57,055
Who's Joe Walsh
or Michele Bachmann?

872
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:59,964
A 14-1 ratio of negative stories
and your takeaway is

873
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:01,366
<i>is that there's a problem
with the storyteller.</i>

874
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,503
What are your thoughts about that,
Taylor Warren?

875
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:06,300
- Cannot remember the question.
- Any word from Reese?

876
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,771
- He's still walking.
- He's what?

877
00:38:08,804 --> 00:38:10,373
He's walking.

878
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:13,143
He's walking around
the neighborhood with a Rockette.

879
00:38:13,184 --> 00:38:16,182
Presumably trying to decide
how to announce the personnel changes

880
00:38:16,214 --> 00:38:19,544
and how much money to pay Dantana
to not file in the morning.

881
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:23,556
- What's a Rockette?
- The dancers.

882
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:26,018
He's dating a Rockette.
A real one.

883
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:32,154
Is there anything that'll convince you
it wasn't your fault?

884
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:39,590
Get together with Sloan
and talk about

885
00:38:39,623 --> 00:38:42,787
a 90-second segment on income
and voting preferences.

886
00:38:42,828 --> 00:38:45,430
- Okay, Jane, we're coming to you.
- If I can jump in...

887
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:48,169
<i>Let's go to DC for
a whip-around on the Senate.</i>

888
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:50,799
I have to cut you off there
and throw to Jane Barrow

889
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,606
and our panel in Washington.

890
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:54,407
Jane, the Republicans
will control the House

891
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,008
and the Democrats
will control the Senate.

892
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,681
<i>A billion dollars later,
are we right back where we were?</i>

893
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,016
- That's the question I want to put to our panel...
- We're out.

894
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,216
DC has the con.

895
00:39:02,249 --> 00:39:03,848
<i>5:30 back.</i>

896
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:06,050
No.

897
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:08,426
No what?

898
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:11,055
There's nothing
that'll convince me.

899
00:39:16,697 --> 00:39:18,834
<i>I just got an e-mail
with an attachment.</i>

900
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,336
- From me?
<i>- Yes.</i>

901
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,937
<i>The attachment was
an article about the effect</i>

902
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,436
<i>of the debates on the election.</i>

903
00:39:23,476 --> 00:39:24,909
- Yeah.
<i>- You know who wrote it?</i>

904
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:26,416
- Neal.
<i>- Nope.</i>

905
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,080
- <i>I can explain.</i>
- The byline says I did.

906
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:31,353
- <i>He knew you were busy.</i>
- What the hell is going on?

907
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:35,261
We need someone
who doesn't work here to post an article

908
00:39:35,294 --> 00:39:37,766
that contains the information
that MacKenzie

909
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:40,566
was president of the Cambridge Union
and not the Oxford Union

910
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,070
<i>so that Wikipedia
would edit her page.</i>

911
00:39:43,103 --> 00:39:46,469
- You know, now that I'm saying it--
- Not until just now?

912
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,971
- What's the mood there?
- What's the mood <i>there</i>?

913
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:52,811
- I know. I know.
- Okay, well, I have to go.

914
00:39:52,844 --> 00:39:54,982
It's starting to sink in
that they're gonna lose Florida.

915
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:57,319
And between you and me,
he didn't write a concession speech.

916
00:39:57,352 --> 00:39:59,822
- Can I ask you something?
- I really do have to go.

917
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,455
So do I, but...

918
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:04,928
do I ever make you feel
like you're dumb?

919
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:07,761
Seriously, honey,
what's going on there?

920
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:11,337
I'm asking because I really like you
and I don't want to blow it.

921
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,040
Well, first of all, you're not smart enough
to make me feel like I'm dumb.

922
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:16,136
I was hoping you'd say that.

923
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,811
And I really like you, too.
You're not blowing it.

924
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:23,417
I knew there had to be a reason
why I liked you so much.

925
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,183
'Cause just physically,
you're hard to look at.

926
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,982
- You're not so much homely...
- Talk to you soon.

927
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:29,550
...as you are
just weird-looking.

928
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:30,815
- Jim.
- Yeah?

929
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:32,857
Maggie says to tell you
they're 93 votes apart now

930
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:34,121
and you'd know what that means.

931
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:35,959
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

932
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:40,697
The gender income gap
starts at 50K.

933
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,234
Men 50K and above
are breaking for Romney.

934
00:40:43,267 --> 00:40:46,072
Women at 50-200K
were more likely to vote for the president.

935
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:49,576
And it's the top 1%
of female earners that went red.

936
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:52,209
Now here's where I'd like us to focus
because this is crucial.

937
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,081
- I'm sorry, but they need you.
- Wow.

938
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:57,512
- They're calling Ohio.
- We're on our way.

939
00:40:57,545 --> 00:41:00,816
You're back in 90 seconds.
We'll pick this up after, okay?

940
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:21,241
We're calling both,
and we're ready to go to Chicago.

941
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:22,905
- Tess.
- I'll get estimates from Boston.

942
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,840
- Thank you.
- And let's get Ben standing by.

943
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:27,478
I don't see Sloan.
Is that Sloan out there?

944
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:29,942
We'll go without her.

945
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:32,280
We're calling it.
Get in the studio.

946
00:41:32,313 --> 00:41:35,484
...go blue,
and that takes the president to 262.

947
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:39,280
At that point, he has a lot
of different roads to 270.

948
00:41:39,313 --> 00:41:42,290
Colorado, Florida, Ohio
and Virginia in that scenario.

949
00:41:42,323 --> 00:41:45,693
<i>Any one of those states
would throw the president over the top.</i>

950
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:47,795
Getting Mitt Romney
to 270 at this point

951
00:41:47,828 --> 00:41:50,593
seems very, very difficult.

952
00:41:50,626 --> 00:41:52,731
So the president's getting
closer and closer

953
00:41:52,764 --> 00:41:54,636
<i>270.</i>

954
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:56,602
<i>He's winning in the states
he needs to win...</i>

955
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:58,864
- What I have can't be taught.
- Get her in the chair!

956
00:41:58,905 --> 00:42:01,166
I mean,
it really started in the last hour

957
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,037
when Florida started
to slip away.

958
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,699
We're hearing from
very unhappy Republicans.

959
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,600
<i>But right now we're going
to Will McAvoy in New York</i>

960
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,839
who's got a new projection.
Will.

961
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,680
It's 11:14 in the East
and ACN is able to project

962
00:42:17,713 --> 00:42:20,550
that Barack Obama
will be living in government housing

963
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:22,077
for the next four years.

964
00:42:22,118 --> 00:42:23,980
President Obama
has been reelected

965
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:25,886
President of the United States,

966
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,192
Ohio having just put him
over the top.

967
00:42:28,225 --> 00:42:30,326
Once again,
the ACN decision desk

968
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:34,157
is calling Ohio and the White House
for President Barack Obama.

969
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,094
We're gonna go live
to Suzannah Marquez

970
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:38,296
and show you some images
from Chicago

971
00:42:38,337 --> 00:42:39,536
<i>where the celebration
is under way.</i>

972
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:41,367
<i>Will,
as you can see, the news</i>

973
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,605
<i>has gone through this crowd
and the celebration has begun.</i>

974
00:42:44,638 --> 00:42:46,908
How about
"binders full of women"?

975
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:49,604
Was the media response to
"binders full of women"

976
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:50,907
in rational proportion?

977
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,475
<i>That's a perfectly good question.</i>

978
00:42:52,508 --> 00:42:54,411
<i>Thanks,
I was asking it to you.</i>

979
00:42:54,444 --> 00:42:57,243
And now he's losing.

980
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,630
Why'd you cut your hair?

981
00:43:08,663 --> 00:43:10,497
I wanted a change.

982
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,066
I'm not crazy about it either.

983
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:13,601
The stylist kind of
talked me into it.

984
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:16,567
- Maybe I'll get used to it.
- There wasn't a stylist.

985
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:19,070
You cut it yourself.

986
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:21,278
You cut off your hair
and dyed it a different color.

987
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:23,676
Lisa told me.

988
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:25,505
How would Lisa know?

989
00:43:25,538 --> 00:43:28,145
How did you not tell her
what happened in Africa?

990
00:43:28,178 --> 00:43:29,681
- Did you?
- No.

991
00:43:29,714 --> 00:43:31,609
- Don't.
- How did you not tell your best friend?

992
00:43:31,649 --> 00:43:34,278
- It's been a year.
- And it's been a year since we were friends.

993
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:38,016
He's losing by 17 votes
with 8,000 votes uncounted.

994
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:40,290
Why did you cut your hair?

995
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:43,994
He'd never seen
blonde hair before.

996
00:43:44,027 --> 00:43:46,732
While I was reading to him,
he was playing with my hair.

997
00:43:46,765 --> 00:43:49,438
So I cut my hair.

998
00:43:49,471 --> 00:43:51,471
- How'd it work?
- It didn't.

999
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:54,572
Right.

1000
00:43:54,605 --> 00:43:57,813
I'm trying to find out
where the uncounted votes are, but even if--

1001
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,879
Listen.
Listen for a second.

1002
00:43:59,912 --> 00:44:02,851
You went back
into the building.

1003
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:05,356
You went back in there.

1004
00:44:05,389 --> 00:44:07,259
You and Gary.

1005
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:08,890
You pulled him out
from under the bed.

1006
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:10,563
- You weren't going without him.
- He was safer under the bed.

1007
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:12,869
Bullshit, Maggie.

1008
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:16,334
You pulled him out and you carried him
on your back to the bus.

1009
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,006
What was your crime?

1010
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:22,077
You turned around
when you heard Gary fall down.

1011
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:28,981
There's a difference
between being tough and wanting to be.

1012
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:31,914
You and Mac are tough.

1013
00:44:31,947 --> 00:44:34,484
Don's tough.
I want to be.

1014
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:37,628
You are.

1015
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:48,865
You know when
I first noticed you?

1016
00:44:48,898 --> 00:44:51,935
When I ran into the room
and got tackled by Mac's luggage?

1017
00:44:51,968 --> 00:44:54,637
Did you know--

1018
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,237
No. It was funny,
but I didn't notice you until later.

1019
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:02,374
There was a beep.
It was an iNews alert.

1020
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:04,381
<i>But it was yellow.</i>

1021
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:06,015
You've got a news alert.

1022
00:45:07,753 --> 00:45:11,185
- Nobody was paying attention to it.
- It was yellow.

1023
00:45:11,226 --> 00:45:13,289
You clicked on it anyway.

1024
00:45:22,396 --> 00:45:24,732
You couldn't help yourself.

1025
00:45:30,575 --> 00:45:32,605
You ran back into the building.

1026
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:39,277
He's dead and I'm alive.

1027
00:45:41,886 --> 00:45:44,052
That's what I'd keep in mind.

1028
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:56,129
It's after midnight now
and I feel like I can ask a question.

1029
00:45:56,162 --> 00:45:58,265
- Sure.
- I meant to Will.

1030
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:00,033
Yes.

1031
00:46:00,066 --> 00:46:02,169
Who did you vote for today?

1032
00:46:02,202 --> 00:46:03,936
You know I'm not
answering that.

1033
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,738
I thought you might
because you revealed

1034
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:07,741
your party affiliation
on the air last year.

1035
00:46:07,774 --> 00:46:09,278
I did.
I identified myself

1036
00:46:09,311 --> 00:46:11,444
as a Republican
because I thought it was fair

1037
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,810
<i>to give to the viewer given
the commentary I was delivering.</i>

1038
00:46:13,843 --> 00:46:15,113
<i>A commentary
that ended with you</i>

1039
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:17,381
<i>calling the Tea Party
the American Taliban.</i>

1040
00:46:17,422 --> 00:46:19,718
- <i>Yes.</i>
- And in the body of the commentary

1041
00:46:19,759 --> 00:46:23,221
- was a blistering indictment of Republicans.
- Exactly the opposite.

1042
00:46:23,262 --> 00:46:25,523
It was a blistering indictment of people
who aren't Republicans.

1043
00:46:25,556 --> 00:46:29,092
- Well, who's to say who is and who isn't?
- On that night, I did.

1044
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:32,100
I want to remind you
you asked me to pursue this area.

1045
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:35,131
- I understand.
- And I'm wondering, with all respect,

1046
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:37,297
do you call yourself
a Republican

1047
00:46:37,338 --> 00:46:40,276
so you can make a claim
to credibility

1048
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:41,942
<i>when you attack the GOP?</i>

1049
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:44,784
No, I call myself a Republican
'cause I am one.

1050
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:47,015
I believe in market solutions

1051
00:46:47,048 --> 00:46:48,583
and I believe in
common sense realities

1052
00:46:48,616 --> 00:46:50,921
<i>and the necessity
to defend ourselves</i>

1053
00:46:50,954 --> 00:46:52,922
<i>against a dangerous world
and that's about it.</i>

1054
00:46:52,963 --> 00:46:55,457
Problem is now
I have to be homophobic.

1055
00:46:55,498 --> 00:46:58,560
I have to count the number of times
people go to church.

1056
00:46:58,593 --> 00:47:03,134
I have to deny facts and think scientific
research is a long con.

1057
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,766
<i>I have to think poor people
are getting a sweet ride.</i>

1058
00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:09,237
And I have to have such a stunning
inferiority complex

1059
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,635
that I fear education
and intellect

1060
00:47:11,668 --> 00:47:13,171
in the 21st century.

1061
00:47:13,204 --> 00:47:14,971
<i>But most of all,
the biggest new requirement,</i>

1062
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:16,540
<i>really the only requirement,</i>

1063
00:47:16,581 --> 00:47:18,716
is that I have
to hate Democrats.

1064
00:47:18,749 --> 00:47:21,887
And I have to hate Chris Christie
for not spitting on the president

1065
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,349
when he got off Air Force One.

1066
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:26,757
<i>The two-party system
is crucial to the whole operation.</i>

1067
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,188
<i>There's honor in being
the loyal opposition.</i>

1068
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,798
And I'm a Republican
for the same reasons you are.

1069
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:35,428
<i>So I hope your voice gets louder
in the next four years.</i>

1070
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:38,834
Well, I don't like losing,
so count on it.

1071
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:41,003
You know, just jumping
on top of that idea--

1072
00:47:41,068 --> 00:47:42,438
- I'm sorry, Sloan.
- Come on!

1073
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:44,343
We're gonna go to
Jane Barrow in Washington

1074
00:47:44,376 --> 00:47:46,878
for an update on some
West Coast House races.

1075
00:47:46,911 --> 00:47:48,908
Plenty more coverage
coming tonight. Jane?

1076
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:51,411
<i>- And clear.</i> 
- Are you doing it on purpose now?

1077
00:47:51,444 --> 00:47:54,085
No, it's just working out
unbelievably well.

1078
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:02,126
You ever read Jedediah Purdy,
<i>For Common Things</i>?

1079
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:04,459
No.

1080
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:07,493
He talks about cynical times.

1081
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:10,767
People having terminal irony

1082
00:48:10,801 --> 00:48:14,500
with a studied refusal
to hope or care openly.

1083
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:17,338
- Does that sound like us?
- No.

1084
00:48:17,371 --> 00:48:19,309
No.

1085
00:48:19,342 --> 00:48:21,142
Have you asked yourself tonight

1086
00:48:21,175 --> 00:48:23,849
why we never reported
the Petraeus story?

1087
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:25,551
- The Petraeus?
- Remember?

1088
00:48:25,584 --> 00:48:27,453
David Petraeus
is resigning on Thursday.

1089
00:48:27,486 --> 00:48:30,255
- <i>We didn't report it.</i>
- That's funny. I forgot.

1090
00:48:30,288 --> 00:48:33,693
Yeah. It's because
we never made the trade.

1091
00:48:33,726 --> 00:48:36,893
The decision was
that the other story had information

1092
00:48:36,926 --> 00:48:39,367
voters needed,
the Petraeus story didn't.

1093
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,966
Not that many voters.
It would have affected maybe a few thousand, tops.

1094
00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:46,565
In one district, one seat.

1095
00:48:46,606 --> 00:48:49,344
As opposed to breaking
two days early

1096
00:48:49,377 --> 00:48:51,546
what will be a giant story.

1097
00:48:51,579 --> 00:48:54,615
Breaking it in front
of an Election Night audience.

1098
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:58,617
And the decision to decline the trade
was made instantly

1099
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:01,227
and unanimously.

1100
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:04,764
Don pushed back reflexively,

1101
00:49:04,797 --> 00:49:06,658
but he came around
in seven seconds.

1102
00:49:06,699 --> 00:49:08,826
Don.

1103
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:14,707
We've come a long way.

1104
00:49:17,908 --> 00:49:20,508
I'm not resigning.

1105
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:22,981
And neither are you.

1106
00:49:23,014 --> 00:49:26,349
What, are we out
of our fucking minds?

1107
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,917
Dantana doctored the tape.
That's what happened, Will.

1108
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:32,589
We know the truth
and the mob doesn't.

1109
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:35,999
When did we decide
it was an institutional failure?

1110
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:39,429
We waited 11 months.

1111
00:49:39,462 --> 00:49:41,498
We know people
who would have gone

1112
00:49:41,531 --> 00:49:45,035
after the second red team meeting
or even the first.

1113
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:46,837
You agree with what I'm saying?

1114
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:49,574
I believe, except for the things we did wrong,
we did everything right.

1115
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:53,444
And I can't live with Mac
taking the blame for--

1116
00:49:53,477 --> 00:49:55,580
We'll get the audience's
trust back.

1117
00:49:55,613 --> 00:49:57,044
Like Leona said,

1118
00:49:57,085 --> 00:50:00,285
<i>we're gonna overcome
the terminal irony.</i>

1119
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,128
<i>And the laundry list
of embarrassing things in the complaint?</i>

1120
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:06,558
<i>I've got to tell you,
I'm not embarrassed.</i>

1121
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:09,227
The Zimmerman tape,
Jim going to New Hampshire,

1122
00:50:09,261 --> 00:50:11,493
Sloan punching a guy
in arbitrage--

1123
00:50:11,534 --> 00:50:13,262
<i>I actually like that one.</i>

1124
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,668
I can't tell
what you're thinking.

1125
00:50:21,343 --> 00:50:23,040
<i>Will?</i>

1126
00:50:24,778 --> 00:50:26,416
It's gotten strange now.

1127
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:28,111
Are you able
to hear me speaking?

1128
00:50:32,288 --> 00:50:35,889
She-- Except for the things she did wrong,
she did everything right, too.

1129
00:50:35,922 --> 00:50:38,298
- The rest was me.
- I'm lost.

1130
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:40,631
Uh, yes.

1131
00:50:40,696 --> 00:50:43,893
We're going to do
the things you just said

1132
00:50:43,926 --> 00:50:45,935
for the reasons you just gave.

1133
00:50:45,968 --> 00:50:49,365
I missed parts of what
you were saying at the end,

1134
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:52,774
but that's just
gonna have to be--

1135
00:50:52,807 --> 00:50:55,343
I'll be right back.
Yes!

1136
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:57,343
Way to go.

1137
00:50:58,711 --> 00:51:01,550
Yeah, no,
I'm definitely resigning.

1138
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:21,198
Does anyone know
where MacKenzie is?

1139
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:22,967
- I think she's in the hair and makeup room.
- She's not.

1140
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,473
- Did you look in her office?
- So, no, no one knows where she is?

1141
00:51:25,506 --> 00:51:27,979
<i>We're back in seven minutes,
so she's gonna turn up.</i>

1142
00:51:31,418 --> 00:51:33,112
- Have you seen Mac?
- I haven't.

1143
00:51:33,153 --> 00:51:34,753
But I have facts about
the Great Lakes region.

1144
00:51:34,786 --> 00:51:37,186
Right this moment is the least I've ever cared
about the Great Lakes region.

1145
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,657
Has anyone seen Mac?

1146
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,824
I'm right here.

1147
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,299
Okay. I didn't--

1148
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:56,302
- Could you come here away from the cameras?
- Yeah.

1149
00:51:58,174 --> 00:52:00,340
There's-- Okay, okay--

1150
00:52:00,373 --> 00:52:01,909
- There's a story.
- What?

1151
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:04,278
There's a story about
a little kid who keeps shredding paper

1152
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:07,446
and his parents take him to all kinds of doctors
to get him to stop shredding paper.

1153
00:52:07,479 --> 00:52:09,883
And finally they take him to
the most expensive doctor in the world

1154
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:12,282
who turns to the kid and he says,
"Kid, if you stop shredding paper,

1155
00:52:12,315 --> 00:52:14,219
your parents will stop
dragging you to doctors."

1156
00:52:14,252 --> 00:52:18,423
And the kid turns to his parents and says,
"Why didn't you just say so?"

1157
00:52:20,862 --> 00:52:23,058
- Well, all right, then.
- The point of the story

1158
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:26,994
is that the kid could make himself happy
by just stopping.

1159
00:52:27,035 --> 00:52:28,499
I think that's the point.
I don't know.

1160
00:52:28,532 --> 00:52:31,575
I've been trying
to figure it out.

1161
00:52:31,608 --> 00:52:34,007
But I didn't return it.

1162
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:36,775
Because I'm in love with you.

1163
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:38,583
- What did you say?
- And because of-- Will you marry me?

1164
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:40,151
- Wait.
- I said will you marry me?

1165
00:52:40,184 --> 00:52:42,119
And before that,
I said I'm in love with you.

1166
00:52:42,152 --> 00:52:43,783
That's-- that's--
That's what I'm getting at.

1167
00:52:43,816 --> 00:52:46,151
I feel like I can do this so much better
if I can have a second.

1168
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:47,590
What in the fuck
is happening right now?

1169
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:51,622
If-- if I--
I don't ever want to not be-- No.

1170
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:54,197
I love you. I'm gonna go back to that.
And will you marry me?

1171
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,427
And let me just say I really think you should.
I think you should say yes.

1172
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,426
But no matter what you say,

1173
00:52:59,466 --> 00:53:02,466
there's no chance
I am ever gonna hurt you again.

1174
00:53:02,499 --> 00:53:05,937
And no matter what you say,
I'm gonna be in love with you for the rest of my life.

1175
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:08,473
There's no way out of that.
That's just a physical law of the universe.

1176
00:53:08,506 --> 00:53:10,670
- You own me. No matter what you say...
- Yes.

1177
00:53:10,703 --> 00:53:14,238
- ...I will never stop--
- Yes. I'm saying yes.

1178
00:53:18,016 --> 00:53:19,512
You're saying yes?

1179
00:53:21,986 --> 00:53:23,554
Yes.

1180
00:53:26,857 --> 00:53:28,454
Thank God.

1181
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:44,211
Took you long enough.

1182
00:53:44,244 --> 00:53:46,443
Seriously?
That's what your--

1183
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:48,042
Shut it.

1184
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,861
So your mother was a Rockette?

1185
00:54:00,894 --> 00:54:02,729
That's right.
And her mother, too.

1186
00:54:02,762 --> 00:54:04,527
- Third generation Rockette?
- Yes.

1187
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,960
How great is that?

1188
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,200
- And if you were to have a daughter...
- Crazy lady.

1189
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:09,801
...which would be
my granddaughter,

1190
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:12,202
would it be important to you
that she also be a Rockette?

1191
00:54:12,235 --> 00:54:13,841
- I don't think important, but if she--
- Okay, good.

1192
00:54:13,874 --> 00:54:16,273
- Charlie.
- 'Cause over here you have a Harvard MBA.

1193
00:54:16,306 --> 00:54:20,111
Over here you have a line
of synchronized nutcrackers.

1194
00:54:20,144 --> 00:54:21,943
- Charlie.
- Reese.

1195
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:24,814
Leona.
Rebecca.

1196
00:54:24,847 --> 00:54:27,450
- I'm sorry, I don't know who--
- Jackie. I'm here with Reese.

1197
00:54:27,483 --> 00:54:30,322
Third generation Rockette.
That's how we roll.

1198
00:54:30,355 --> 00:54:32,392
I've studied the findings
of the report

1199
00:54:32,426 --> 00:54:33,888
and I've consulted with counsel

1200
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:36,423
<i>and I've reached the conclusion
that the news division</i>

1201
00:54:36,456 --> 00:54:39,363
handled Genoa as well
as I'd want it handled.

1202
00:54:39,396 --> 00:54:42,098
<i>Furthermore, this company
will give Dantana money</i>

1203
00:54:42,131 --> 00:54:44,600
<i>when a federal judge
orders us to do so.</i>

1204
00:54:44,633 --> 00:54:47,809
And furthermore after that,
I don't take my instructions

1205
00:54:47,842 --> 00:54:49,379
from a petition.

1206
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:51,981
If you read Jedediah Purdy's excellent book
<i>For Common Things</i>--

1207
00:54:52,014 --> 00:54:53,979
What, did you e-mail
everybody excerpts?

1208
00:54:54,012 --> 00:54:56,343
- Yep.
- I'm not accepting your resignations.

1209
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,247
We're not resigning.

1210
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,720
That's fine, but I'm surprising you
by taking the high road

1211
00:55:02,753 --> 00:55:04,553
- and I'm not accepting your resignations.
- We're not offering them.

1212
00:55:04,586 --> 00:55:06,122
This isn't about
the bottom line.

1213
00:55:06,163 --> 00:55:08,131
This is a bad business decision,
but it's a good decision.

1214
00:55:08,164 --> 00:55:09,931
- <i>I'm doing the right thing.</i>
- There's no right thing to do.

1215
00:55:09,964 --> 00:55:11,700
I've already made the decision
that we're staying.

1216
00:55:11,733 --> 00:55:14,173
The wrong thing to do
would be to accept your resignation.

1217
00:55:14,206 --> 00:55:16,302
That's not an option,
'cause we're not offering them.

1218
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:19,846
- You two about done?
- History should reflect that I acted admirably.

1219
00:55:19,879 --> 00:55:21,678
There's really no way
of knowing that.

1220
00:55:21,711 --> 00:55:23,780
Is it possible the greater glory
belongs to me?

1221
00:55:23,813 --> 00:55:26,645
You're all idiots.
Not you, you're sweet.

1222
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:30,350
Everyone, just listen up
for just a second.

1223
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,756
This'll just take a second.

1224
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:33,388
First of all,
no one's resigning.

1225
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:35,290
And the only reason you need
is 'cause I said so.

1226
00:55:35,323 --> 00:55:37,890
<i>Also I think we're just starting to
get the hang of this.</i>

1227
00:55:37,923 --> 00:55:40,226
More importantly,
I would like to introduce

1228
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:45,232
the future Mrs. MacKenzie
Morgan McHale McAv--

1229
00:55:45,265 --> 00:55:47,034
That's not gonna work.

1230
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:51,306
What?!

1231
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:54,445
- I'll be damned!
<i>- I know.</i>

1232
00:55:54,478 --> 00:55:57,581
I know.
I know.

1233
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,608
- Wake him up.
- Cynthia's office should draft a statement.

1234
00:56:26,641 --> 00:56:28,702
Let's start identifying
who our friends are.

1235
00:56:28,735 --> 00:56:30,069
That shouldn't take long.

1236
00:56:59,709 --> 00:57:01,505
What did you do?

1237
00:57:01,538 --> 00:57:03,313
I wrote it myself.

1238
00:57:03,346 --> 00:57:05,410
A gift from new media.

1239
00:57:05,483 --> 00:57:07,420
Thanks for that
Romney interview.

1240
00:57:48,544 --> 00:57:53,386
