<i>If Ben Furusho
hadn't broken his ankle,</i>

3
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,212
<i>if Jim Harper hadn't gone
to New Hampshire to cover for him,</i>

4
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,681
<i>if Jerry Dantana hadn't been
brought up from DC to cover for Jim,</i>

00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:23,484
<i>if Mike Tapley had been
used on the panel</i>

6
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:25,120
<i>instead of Cyrus West,
do you think that--</i>

7
00:01:25,154 --> 00:01:27,289
<i>- Genoa.</i>
<i>- Say again?</i>

8
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:29,191
<i>The name of the black op
was Genoa, not Geneva.</i>

9
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:31,728
<i>It's a kind of a jib
or foresail on a boat.</i>

10
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:33,196
<i>Did I say Geneva?</i>

11
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:35,132
No, but Matt typed it
in his notes just now.

12
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:37,201
Mark.
And he's right, I did.

13
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:40,171
- How did you know that?
- Well...

14
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,641
I don't like to talk about it,
but I know things.

15
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:44,309
<i>Ever since I was a boy.</i>

16
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:45,877
People have called it a gift,

17
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:46,845
but it's really more
of a burden.

18
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,913
You want to stop
screwing around?

19
00:01:47,947 --> 00:01:49,448
I can see his fingers
on the keyboard.

20
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:51,116
He typed Geneva.
We work in television.

21
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,585
- <i>There's no reason we can't have jokes.</i>
- You work in television.

22
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:55,153
- I'm a litigator at Lowell Tiller.
- Genuflect when you say that.

23
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:57,622
And there are a lot of reasons
we can't have jokes. Should I list them?

24
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:59,924
You went on the air
with a story

25
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,160
- that alleged the US used nerve gas...
<i>- It was a mistake.</i>

26
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:03,928
- during an operation, which is a war crime...
- On the enemy.

27
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:06,464
- We had two eyewitnesses and a three-star general.
<i>- and a doctored interview</i>

28
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:08,366
and a producer who says that
<i>News Night</i> conspired with the Pentagon...

29
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:09,701
- That's why we fired him.
- to cover up Operation Geneva.

30
00:02:09,802 --> 00:02:11,637
- Genoa.
- Fuck me!

31
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,575
Well?

32
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:18,679
Would one of you fuck
Miss Halliday, please?

33
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:22,449
- That was a little funny.
- Finally.

34
00:02:22,484 --> 00:02:25,719
Did you take calls from the DOD
asking you not to run the story?

35
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,087
That happens all the time.

36
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:29,723
The entire population
of the Pensacola Minimum Security Prison

37
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:31,793
is people who did things
that happen all the time.

38
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,829
- We ran the story.
<i>- Then you retracted it?</i>

39
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,398
- Of course we retracted it.
- At the urging of the DOD?

40
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:38,100
Absolutely not.

41
00:02:38,134 --> 00:02:40,302
- Excuse me.
- Come on in.

42
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,538
Maggie Jordan,
this is Rebecca Halliday, our lawyer.

43
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,375
These are her associates Bob,
Tom, and Curt.

44
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:46,542
- Ross Kessler.
- Mark Gage.

45
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:47,877
- Ken Weinraub.
<i>- What do you got?</i>

46
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:50,714
Looks like Romney's gonna add
an event in Charlotte at 8:00.

47
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:51,816
He's gonna go on
around 8:15.

48
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,184
We'll cut in
if he's saying something,

49
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:55,587
- <i>otherwise we'll stay with Sandy.</i>
- Got it.

50
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:01,259
Maggie Jordan
is Margaret Jordan?

51
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:02,527
- Yeah.
- What happened to her hair?

52
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:04,028
I don't know.
Women try things.

53
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,830
What the hell
happened to her hair?

54
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:09,168
Look, she went out on a story.
She went to Uganda.

55
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:11,971
It got real very fast and she came back
a little messed up.

56
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:15,308
Well, if this goes to the next level,
she better get un-messed up in a hurry

57
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:16,809
because she's
a character witness

58
00:03:16,844 --> 00:03:18,511
and she looks like the Girl
with the Dragon Tattoo.

59
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:20,647
Counsel, if what happened to her
happened to you,

60
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,249
you'd kill yourself
for the rest of your life.

61
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:25,719
You would sit in the middle of a room
and cry forever.

62
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:29,089
A year ago,
she looked like this.

63
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:31,559
Now she looks like that.
What happened to her in Africa?

64
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:33,261
- It doesn't matter.
<i>- Can I decide that?</i>

65
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,596
- I'm her lawyer.
- I'm her lawyer.

66
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:37,065
And your lawyer.
And MacKenzie's.

67
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,167
And everybody's.
And if you don't let me do my job--

68
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:42,137
You're gonna do what?
Jump up really high in the air and swat my chin?

69
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:44,172
I have the confidence
of a tall man.

70
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:46,307
Lose.

71
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:48,343
I was going to say lose.

72
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:52,447
And no one responsible for Genoa
will ever work again,

73
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:56,017
including, and especially, the anchor
and executive producer of the broadcast.

74
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,787
- <i>If Jim Harper hadn't gone to--</i>
- No.

75
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,088
Let me finish the question.

76
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:02,090
We don't have
that kind of time.

77
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,358
No, if Jim hadn't gone
to New Hampshire,

78
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:05,226
if Dantana hadn't come up
to cover for him,

79
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,261
if West hadn't been
on the drone panel,

80
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,396
if 17 different things
hadn't conspired

81
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:13,066
in just the right order,
we wouldn't be sitting here.

82
00:04:14,268 --> 00:04:16,503
14 months ago,
you went on the air

83
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:18,305
and called the Tea Party
the American Taliban.

84
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,639
- I did.
- And?

85
00:04:19,674 --> 00:04:20,974
The Taliban resented it.

86
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:24,711
14 months ago,
you went on the--

87
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:26,813
We're starting
at the beginning.

88
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:28,815
<i>14 months ago,
you went on the air</i>

89
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,517
<i>and called the Tea Party
the American Taliban.</i>

90
00:04:30,552 --> 00:04:32,353
Yeah.

91
00:04:32,387 --> 00:04:33,521
What happened then?

92
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:36,390
- A lot.
- For starters?

93
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:38,826
The president of AWM

94
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,995
got kicked out
of the Capitol Building.

95
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,313
- Have they started yet?
- No, sir.

96
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:02,482
I was at the Jefferson.
I couldn't get a cab.

97
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:04,317
You can pick up
your ID right there.

98
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:08,121
There's supposed
to be a card for me.

99
00:05:08,155 --> 00:05:10,190
I don't see the ID here.

100
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:12,659
Reese Lansing, AWM.

101
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:17,130
- I don't see your name, sir.
- Lansing, Reese Lansing.

102
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:19,966
I don't have a Lansing here.

103
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,701
Maybe there's a typo.
Can you look under--

104
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:23,503
Everyone's accounted for.

105
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:27,039
This is a Judiciary--
Yeah, I see people I know in there.

106
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:29,275
It's okay.
I'm the president of AWM.

107
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,411
I can't let you in without ID.

108
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:33,212
- Who do I speak to?
- About what?

109
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:36,249
- About getting in the door?
- Me.

110
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:39,886
I honestly don't mean to be rude,
but you're the man with the clipboard

111
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,788
and I need to speak to
the chairman or ranking member

112
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:43,657
of the House
Judiciary Committee.

113
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:45,426
And what's standing
in between you and doing that?

114
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,127
You.

115
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,537
Okay.

116
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,379
No, it wasn't an oversight.
It was deliberate.

117
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:05,915
- Those two words are antonyms.
- Are you telling me--

118
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,917
Who'd have thought that
calling Tea Party congressmen

119
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,819
the American Taliban
would have consequences?

120
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:12,522
- Are you saying--
- There was absolutely no way to see this coming.

121
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:15,124
The consequence was that you were
left off of a guest list.

122
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:17,493
For SOPA!
Not the Met Gala.

123
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:20,029
It almost seems like when we
called them the American Taliban,

124
00:06:20,064 --> 00:06:22,098
- they minded.
- Stop.

125
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,468
Are you telling me AWM
was left out of a meeting

126
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:27,938
with the US House of Representatives
because of the show last week?

127
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:29,506
Oh, don't be silly.

128
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,210
Wait. Yes, that is exactly
what we're telling you.

129
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:35,379
Do you know how much we lose
every year to piracy?

130
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:37,614
- No.
- No, me neither.

131
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,483
It could be 10 billion.
Could be 100 billion.

132
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:41,485
- Let's just assume it's 10 billion.
- Okay.

133
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,520
I want the 10 billion!

134
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:45,088
We own intellectual property

135
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:47,924
and I want the fucking pajama people
to stop stealing it.

136
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,592
Let's try to get to
the bottom of exactly why

137
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,794
they minded being called
the American Taliban,

138
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,896
'cause I don't get it.

139
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:55,665
- Is your suit mildewing?
- Yes, it is.

140
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,402
AWM doesn't
just create content.

141
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,971
We own the physical lines
and ISPs that bring it to you.

142
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:04,541
SOPA would allow you to sue us just for
pointing you toward a bootleg Chili Peppers track.

143
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:07,377
- Doesn't that screw you on both ends?
- Yeah.

144
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:09,613
That's sort of why we wanted
to help write the law.

145
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,681
But three members of
the Judiciary Committee

146
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:13,617
ran and won
with Tea Party support.

147
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:16,153
And kicked AWM
out of the country?

148
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:18,288
- Yep.
- They misinterpreted the Taliban comparison

149
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:20,691
and heard it as some kind of,
I don't know,

150
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:22,660
insult or whatever.

151
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:24,828
You know,
when he said it two weeks ago,

152
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:27,298
I-- I smiled.

153
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:30,968
I thought let the chips fall
where they may.

154
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:32,836
You know what I'm thinking now?

155
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:36,507
- I don't.
- Chips are falling.

156
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,251
People are mad at him, Charlie.

157
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,421
They're gonna be mad
at you, too.

158
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:52,557
Fuck 'em.

159
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,459
I don't know.

160
00:07:56,495 --> 00:07:58,696
The rebels just took Tripoli.

161
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:05,470
Wait, what?

162
00:08:05,505 --> 00:08:07,439
<i>When roughly nine hours ago,</i>

163
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:10,142
rebel forces swarmed
the Bab al-Azizia,

164
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,212
Muammar Gaddafi's compound
and less a presidential palace

165
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:15,715
<i>than a military fortress
and a symbol of his reign.</i>

166
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:17,684
After a siege of several hours

167
00:08:17,718 --> 00:08:19,719
and an extended gun
and mortar battle,

168
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:20,954
Gaddafi's compound fell.

169
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:22,889
<i>And while there's
celebration in the streets,</i>

170
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:24,924
no one at this hour
knows the whereabouts

171
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:28,261
of the now deposed strongman
who ruled Libya for 42 years.

172
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:30,330
We go live
to ACN's Shannon Hammid,

173
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:33,900
who is standing outside the compound
just south of Tripoli's city center

174
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:35,468
where it's a few minutes
after 2:00 AM.

175
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:38,138
- <i>Shannon?</i>
- Go six. Ready SOT one.

176
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:41,040
Will, this is
a jubilant day in Libya.

177
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:44,945
While there remain a few
isolated patches of fighting

178
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:47,314
in the Gaddafi
loyalist suburbs,

179
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:49,416
the...

180
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,354
gunfire that you hear
is largely celebratory.

181
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:55,656
- SOT one.
<i>- You can see some of the rebels</i>

182
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,658
- <i>on their way to the compound.</i>
<i>- 45 back.</i>

183
00:08:57,693 --> 00:08:59,260
We got to pull
the Strauss-Kahn package.

184
00:08:59,295 --> 00:09:00,996
- Why?
- We blew the fact check.

185
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:02,798
We say the French police
charged him with attempted rape.

186
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:04,867
The French police are investigating him
for attempted rape.

187
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,935
We push play on that package
in 90 seconds.

188
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,337
- Is it on camera or VO?
- VO.

189
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:11,106
Show it to me. 16.
Get Ryan on the phone.

190
00:09:11,141 --> 00:09:12,675
Use a landline.
Jake, let's go.

191
00:09:12,743 --> 00:09:14,443
- 15 seconds live.
- 16's up.

192
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:16,178
- Play it.
<i>- Package goes in 60.</i>

193
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:17,880
Did you know that in '91,

194
00:09:17,914 --> 00:09:21,217
20 Kuwaitis died after being
hit by falling bullets

195
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:22,885
while celebrating the end
of the Cold War?

196
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,188
- I didn't.
<i>- The law of averages caught up to them.</i>

197
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:27,390
Yeah.

198
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:31,060
118 people treated
at a Los Angeles hospital

199
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:32,595
for injuries sustained
from random falling--

200
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:34,163
- Shut up!
- Copy that.

201
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:35,698
Right there.

202
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:38,100
In three, two...

203
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,102
Shannon, at this hour,
do the rebels know

204
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:43,105
anything about where
Colonel Gaddafi might be?

205
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,274
- That's their frustration. He's vanished.
- Answer the phone.

206
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:47,542
<i>But he's believed
to still be in Tripoli?</i>

207
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:49,310
Nobody knows for sure.

208
00:09:49,345 --> 00:09:51,546
Ryan, hey, it's Jim.

209
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,948
- I'm putting you on speaker at New York control.
<i>- Play it.</i>

210
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:55,683
- <i>What's going on?</i>
<i>- Where are you?</i>

211
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:57,985
- <i>Benihana with my kids.</i>
- Get to a quiet place. Hurry.

212
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,353
<i>- 30 seconds.</i>
- Play it for me.

213
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:02,690
<i>But there's more trouble
ahead for the French diplomat.</i>

214
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:05,826
<i>Strauss-Kahn still faces
a civil suit here in New York.</i>

215
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,127
<i>And in an unrelated case,
French police have charged him</i>

216
00:10:08,162 --> 00:10:11,965
<i>with the attempted rape of
writer Tristane Banon in 2003.</i>

217
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,000
Ryan?

218
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:15,969
- You there?
<i>- Sorry. Yeah.</i>

219
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:20,440
Say "are investigating charges
of attempted rape brought by."

220
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:23,443
<i>Are investigating charges
of attempted rape brought by.</i>

221
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:26,546
- Two-tenths over.
- A little faster on my cue.

222
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:29,516
Say it like a phrase.
Stand by.

223
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,485
Shannon Hammid reporting
live on this historic day from Tripoli.

224
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,121
Turning now to
Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

225
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,724
Today, New York Supreme Court
Judge Michael Obus

226
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:40,627
<i>dismissed all charges
against the former IMF chief</i>

227
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:42,662
after the prosecution
cited problems

228
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,330
with the accuser's credibility.

229
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:47,500
- Roll 16.
- On my cue, Ryan.

230
00:10:47,534 --> 00:10:51,070
<i>A smiling and
visibly relieved Dominique Strauss-Kahn</i>

231
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:53,506
<i>walked out of the courtroom
a free man today,</i>

232
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,542
<i>more than three months after the
former head of the International Monetary Fund</i>

233
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,844

with sexual assault.</i>

Heads up.

They're drunk
in the mornings, too.

285

00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:35,732
- Your parents must be proud.
- They are.

304
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,568
- I was elected unanimously.
- You were unopposed.

305
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:40,137
Just like when you were
elected class treasurer.

306
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:41,472
- That was an important job.
- It wasn't.

307
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:42,840
Why does it have
to be like this?

308
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,342
Because you're a nerd
and I'm a nerd

309
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:45,877
and you make nerds look bad.

310
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,112
No, I make nerds look good.

311
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:48,847
I've been meaning to tell you
you've been doing

312
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:52,017
a perfectly adequate job
filling in for Elliot this week.

313
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:54,287
There's a wire report about
a drone strike in the FATA

314
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,689
- that killed five suspected militants.
- Excellent.

315
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:59,293
- You heard me say suspected, right?
- Talk to your EP.

316
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:01,562
- Mac.
- Just a minute.

317
00:14:01,596 --> 00:14:03,497
Ben Furusho broke his ankle.

318
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,333
- Is he all right?
- No, he's an idiot.

319
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,034
But let me know who to put on
the Romney bus for a couple of weeks.

320
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:09,670
- I'll check out what people are working on.
- Sloan, you want me?

321
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:10,638
<i>- M.J.</i>
- Yeah?

322
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:11,972
- <i>Is your cousin--</i>
- Crazy?

323
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,808
- Yeah.
- She is.

324
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:16,010
- She's spamming me to death.
- Why'd you give her your e-mail?

325
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:17,878
She asked for it and I thought
it would please you.

326
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:19,446
Everything I do
I do to please you.

327
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:20,814
- She's crazy.
- Thanks for the heads up.

328
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:23,650
<i>So what do you
want to do tonight?</i>

329
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:25,285
What would please you?

330
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:26,987
Romantic drink?
Dancing?

331
00:14:27,021 --> 00:14:28,989
- Romantic bowling?
- What does that look like?

332
00:14:29,023 --> 00:14:30,924
It looks a lot like
regular bowling.

333
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,759
- Walk through the park?
- A romantic mugging.

334
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:35,128
- I know how to defend myself.
- Do you know how to defend me?

335
00:14:35,163 --> 00:14:37,565
I shout "run" really loud.

336
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,200
- I'll see you at home.
- Perfect.

337
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:41,603
- Have a good show.
- Not a chance.

338
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,484
- Excuse me.
- He'll be out in a minute.

339
00:14:56,518 --> 00:14:58,453
- I'll come back.
- Do I know you?

340
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:00,988
- I'm Jenna Johnson. I just started as an intern.
- You look familiar.

341
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:03,858
Say "Why is America
the greatest country in the world?"

342
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:06,560
- Why is America the greatest--
- You're the sorority girl!

343
00:15:06,595 --> 00:15:08,562
- That's what I'm most famous for.
- You hired her?

344
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:11,165
I'm benevolent.
There are eight Broadway musicals

345
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,733
that have won
the Pulitzer Prize for drama.

346
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:15,436
In five minutes,
I need you to name them, the composer,

347
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,039
lyricist, librettist,
and source material, if any.

348
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:19,774
- I need your--
- Go.

349
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:22,677
You make the interns learn
musical theater history?

350
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:24,779
You're welcome, America.

351
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:26,881
Gaddafi's done.

352
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:29,050
Things you thought
you'd never see.

353
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:32,186
I want to talk to you about
the 9/11 anniversary coverage.

354
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:34,322
I like how it's coming
along so far.

355
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:36,624
It has a good tone.
It looks up.

356
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:40,061
I'm gonna pull you
from the coverage.

357
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:43,532
Elliot and Sloan
will coanchor in prime time.

358
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:47,503
- Because Reese got kicked out?
- It's not Reese.

359
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:49,071
- Leona?
- It's me.

360
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:50,839
I made the decision.

361
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:53,342
All right.

362
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:56,111
We're gonna be officially condemned
on the House floor tomorrow.

363
00:15:56,146 --> 00:15:57,446
That's a good use of time.

364
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,314
- And Giuliani pulled out.
- Yeah?

365
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:02,451
9/11 widows,
first responders--

366
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:05,253
Some 9/11 widows
and first responders.

367
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:07,422
I know.
It's the critical mass.

368
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:10,892
The op-eds, the boycotts,
the advertisers,

369
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,060
Reese getting kicked out
of the SOPA meeting,

370
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:14,462
which you know
we're gonna read about.

371
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:16,130
I just think
on this one day--

372
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:18,800
- No, I totally get it.
- Okay.

373
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:23,172
- Let me talk to Reese.
- It's not Reese.

374
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:24,940
- Leona.
- They haven't said a word about 9/11.

375
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:27,876
They've got bigger fish.

376
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:30,379
For the record, I compared
the Tea Party to the Taliban

377
00:16:30,413 --> 00:16:32,748
and we were attacked
by Al Qaeda.

378
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:36,285
I don't want to ask people to make
that distinction on the 10th anniversary.

379
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:38,721
No, we've never gone wrong
getting our enemies mixed up.

380
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:41,424
It's just not the day
to have the argument.

381
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,393
How do you want to handle it?

382
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:45,829
You'll get the flu
around the 9th or 10th.

383
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,931
Okay.

384
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:52,202
Listen, they'll do it at your desk
under the <i>News Night</i> logo,

385
00:16:52,236 --> 00:16:54,504
but I'm gonna take your name
off of it for the night.

386
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:57,340
Contractually I need
your permission.

387
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:00,877
I'm sorry.

388
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,646
No, man. It's the price
of doing business.

389
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,382
For what it's worth,
I didn't know you were gonna say it,

390
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:07,951
but I was happy when you did.

391
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,653
Me, too.

392
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:12,890
All right.

393
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:14,224
Don't worry about it, Charlie.

394
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:16,126
I'll see you upstairs
for the draft.

395
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,895
All right.

396
00:17:25,638 --> 00:17:27,472
<i>Of Thee I Sing</i>, 1932.

397
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:30,074
Music by George Gershwin,
lyrics by Ira Gershwin,

398
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:32,811
book by George S. Kaufman
and Morrie Ryskind.

399
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,747
- <i>Fiorello!</i> 19--
- All right.

400
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,952
I need your suit.

401
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:42,854
Yeah.

402
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:08,812
- How's it going?
- Me?

403
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,814
- Yeah.
- Good.

404
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:13,083
I'm just, you know.

405
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,354
Is this brutally awkward?

406
00:18:17,422 --> 00:18:19,823
No.

407
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:22,727
'Cause I was thinking
if we could just say so and name it,

408
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:25,630
then we could go back
to the way things were.

409
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,667
Yeah.

410
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:31,904
- So...
- I don't want to go back to the way things were.

411
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,176
I meant being friends
and it not being awkward.

412
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,845
It was always awkward.
That's the way things were.

413
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:42,581
You want to say it wasn't a big deal?
Okay, we're friends.

414
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:44,316
But you're also staff
and at some point

415
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,720
this conversation
is inappropriate.

416
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:49,922
I don't understand
what you're saying.

417
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,391
It's only awkward
because you want it to be.

418
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,128
That's a big accusation.

419
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:03,002
All right.
We'll try again tomorrow.

420
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:05,572
You blew the fact check on DSK.

421
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:08,041
- I know.
- Okay.

422
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,624
Yeah?

423
00:19:24,658 --> 00:19:26,559
- I'll go.
- Where?

424
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:29,529
- New Hampshire. I'll cover for Ben.
- Why?

425
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:31,698
I've never been on
the road with a campaign.

426
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,066
I didn't know you wanted to.

427
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,768
Wait 10 months
till he's the nominee.

428
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,703
- I'd like to go now.
- Nothing to cover.

429
00:19:36,737 --> 00:19:38,338
- Of course there is.
- There isn't.

430
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:40,807
It's the same three rallies
and three diners a day.

431
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:42,842
Ben puts down a stand-up
at each of them.

432
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,811
When was the last time
you saw any of them on the air?

433
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:46,279
- I don't know.
- Send Martin.

434
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:47,513
I'd really like to go.

435
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,549
You're the senior
producer here.

436
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,983
- That's great.
- No, I'm saying

437
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:52,484
you're gonna be fighting
it out with stringers

438
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,853
- to get access to low-level staff.
- I know what they do.

439
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:58,624
Romney's not McCain if you've got some vision
of kicking it in the RV with the candidates.

440
00:19:58,658 --> 00:20:00,159
- I don't.
- You're gonna be bored--

441
00:20:00,193 --> 00:20:02,561
Mac, fire me or send me
to New Hampshire!

442
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:14,773
Sorry.

443
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:19,178
What's wrong with you?

444
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:22,915
I just want to get out of town
for a couple of weeks.

445
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,818
Mm-hmm.

446
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:30,757
You know when you
blew it with Will,

447
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,359
you went to Peshawar.

448
00:20:33,394 --> 00:20:36,529
There aren't any Taliban
fighters in Concord.

449
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:39,632
It'll just be two weeks.

450
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:45,104
You should bring Jerry Dantana
up from DC to cover for me.

451
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:48,174
Five suspected militants
were killed

452
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,609
by a US drone strike
in the FATA.

453
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:51,812
The unmanned Predator drone
fired two missiles

454
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:55,148
at a vehicle driving on a main road
in North Waziristan.

455
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:57,484
Is it illegal? Yes.
Is it immoral? You bet.

456
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,719
Are we going to investigate it?
Of course not.

457
00:20:59,787 --> 00:21:02,089
<i>Jerry, you're gonna drive me
crazy with the drone shit.</i>

458
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:04,157
<i>I'm gonna have one
target your car.</i>

459
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:05,959
That's my other line.

460
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:08,728
Sorry for annoying you
with the news.

461
00:21:08,763 --> 00:21:11,364
- Jerry Dantana.
<i>- Jerry.</i>

462
00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:13,233
It's MacKenzie in New York.

463
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:15,769
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

464
00:21:34,153 --> 00:21:36,021
Cats and kittens,
grab your mittens.

465
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:37,689
It's Will McAvoy
and Van Morrison

466
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:40,392
takin' you through the night
and "Into the Mystic."

467
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:43,028
- Why didn't you tell me?
<i>- Let's take some calls.</i>

468
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:46,031
Who do we have on the line, Freddy?
It's MacKenzie from Midtown.

469
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:47,866
You're talking
to the Nightbird.

470
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,267
Why didn't you tell me you were
taken off the 9/11 anniversary?

471
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:53,471
What are you doing up this late,
MacKenzie from Midtown?

472
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:55,606
Charlie just called me to ask
how you were handling it

473
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:57,041
and I said,
"Handling what?"

474
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:59,010
It was the right thing
to do, caller.

475
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:02,547
- Bullshit.
<i>- Freddy, you better grab that seven-second delay.</i>

476
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:05,850
- Knock it off.
- Let's not make it a big deal.

477
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:07,819
- <i>You're okay with this?</i>
- I am.

478
00:22:07,853 --> 00:22:10,455
- Can I go back to sleep?
<i>- You're in bed?</i>

479
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,025
It's the middle of the night.

480
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,994
Why is there music playing?

481
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:19,097
<i>Same reason your night-light's on
right now.</i>

482
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:25,469
All right.

483
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:27,938
All right.

Hey, how you doing?

489
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:58,268
- Hey, excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

490
00:22:58,302 --> 00:22:59,869
- Are you the lead advance?
- Yes, sir.

491
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:01,338
I'm Jim Harper.

492
00:23:01,372 --> 00:23:03,473
I'm gonna fill in for Ben Furusho
for a couple of weeks.

493
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:06,676
- How's Ben doing?
- His ankle's broken, but he'll be okay.

494
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:08,679
I just drove up from New York.

495
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:10,681
Do I have time to check in
and drop off my stuff?

496
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:12,516
Sure, we'll wait
as long as you want.

497
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:14,318
Thanks.

498
00:23:17,422 --> 00:23:18,889
That was sarcastic?

499
00:23:18,924 --> 00:23:21,759
No, I'll just tell the governor
not to start speaking until you get there.

500
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:23,694
- Got it.
- So you're with ACN?

501
00:23:23,729 --> 00:23:25,563
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, but the bus is full today.

502
00:23:25,597 --> 00:23:28,833
- You'll have to drive.
- There's--

503
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:32,169
there's like 40 empty seats.

504
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:35,072
I wasn't wild about
the American Taliban broadcast.

505
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:38,910
Dude, you can't keep me off the bus just
'cause you didn't like our reporting.

506
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:41,212
- I can.
- Come on, man.

507
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:44,449
- I've been driving all night.
- Then you better get some gas.

508
00:23:44,517 --> 00:23:47,152
What's Obama got it at,
4.50 a gallon now?

509
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:49,755

You could have checked
into the hotel first.

514
00:24:10,176 --> 00:24:13,178
I can do that tonight.
You heard about the latest drone strike?

515
00:24:13,212 --> 00:24:15,180
<i>We reported it at 10:00.</i>

516
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:16,914
Yeah, but that's all we did.

517
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:20,518
You and Sloan Sabbith
are gonna get along very well.

518
00:24:20,552 --> 00:24:22,052
You're gonna meet
Will now, okay?

519
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,254
- We've met.
- He's not gonna remember.

520
00:24:24,322 --> 00:24:26,823
- Will, this is Jerry Dantana.
- We've met.

521
00:24:26,858 --> 00:24:28,959
Of course we have.
How you been, man?

522
00:24:29,027 --> 00:24:31,061
We had a long talk
the last time he was in DC.

523
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,997
Great. Jerry's gonna cover
for Jim for a couple of weeks.

524
00:24:34,032 --> 00:24:36,634
- I have no idea why you let him go.
- 'Cause I did.

525
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:38,636
- I'm sure Terry's a good guy and an excellent senior...
- Jerry.

526
00:24:38,703 --> 00:24:40,671
but I fear change
and that should be respected.

527
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:43,908
- You'll get used to me.
- And then Jim will come back and it'll be a hellscape.

528
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,843
- Why don't we send Harry to new Hampshire?
- Who's Harry?

529
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:47,378
- He is.
- Jerry.

530
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:49,213
- See what I mean?
- No, no one does.

531
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:51,482
- Can I mention something?
- Sure.

532
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:53,450
I think this network
should be doing stories

533
00:24:53,485 --> 00:24:55,552
about the administration's
counterterrorism policies.

534
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:56,887
And I think while
I'm in New York,

535
00:24:56,922 --> 00:24:58,822
it would be a good time
for me to get it started.

536
00:24:58,857 --> 00:25:00,557
It's actually not
a great time for me.

537
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:01,858
But that go-getter
initiative you have,

538
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:04,061
I'm not crazy
about that, either.

539
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:05,829
Remember that long talk
we had in DC?

540
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:09,766
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you want to lead or do you want to follow?

541
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,701
- He wants to follow.
- And barely that.

542
00:25:11,736 --> 00:25:12,902
Come in.

543
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,772
- It's my office.
- Drone strike.

544
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,373
- I don't believe this.
- Drone strike.

545
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:19,208
- This is Jerry Dantana.
- There was another one?

546
00:25:19,243 --> 00:25:20,743
- This morning.
<i>- What you got there?</i>

547
00:25:20,778 --> 00:25:22,478
- Drone strike. Drone strike.
- Hmm?

548
00:25:22,513 --> 00:25:24,080
Can't understand
what you're saying.

549
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,481
You can too understand
what I'm-- Reuters.

550
00:25:25,515 --> 00:25:27,116
This is what
I was talking--

551
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,118
United States Predator drone
strikes vehicle in northwest Pakistan.

552
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,653
- Can I see that?
- It's a blank piece of paper.

553
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:32,322
I left the wire report
in my office

554
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,457
and on the way here,
I decided I wanted a prop.

555
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,026
You didn't think to just
have someone print it out?

556
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,095
A lot of better ideas are
coming to me as I'm standing here,

557
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:40,964
- but why don't we let the past be the past?
- It was 12 seconds ago.

558
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:43,234
<i>Two US officials
identified the target</i>

559
00:25:43,268 --> 00:25:46,604
of the drone attack as Abu Hafs al-Shahri,
a Saudi national.

560
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:49,074
They declined to provide
more precise details.

561
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:51,008
Hold the roll.
The government is declining to reveal

562
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:53,377
highly classified intelligence
and expose the methods

563
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:56,047
by which we find and kill terrorists?
That is just plain wacky.

564
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:58,549
- All this is is a press release.
- It's a blank piece of paper.

565
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:00,752
No reporter gets to ask,
"Did we kill any civilians?"

566
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:02,453
Or how does Pakistan
feel about us

567
00:26:02,488 --> 00:26:04,355
invading their airspace
to kill people occasionally?

568
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,092
- Or who authorized the strike?
- Or who's Abu Hafs al-Shahri?

569
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:09,027
He's the head of Al Qaeda
in Pakistan.

570
00:26:09,061 --> 00:26:10,628
And the Commander in Chief
authorized the strike.

571
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:12,864
I'd like this for
my five minutes tonight.

572
00:26:12,898 --> 00:26:14,766
- It's not an economic story.
- Watch me make it one.

573
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,701
It should be a full panel
right after the A block

574
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:18,369
where presumably
we'll stay with Libya.

575
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:20,739
- An ethicist, a military analyst--
- And me.

576
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:22,407
I'd rather have a human rights expert.
No offense.

577
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:24,209
We're not loading
the panel to the left.

578
00:26:24,244 --> 00:26:25,644
Why are we having
a panel at all?

579
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,346
- I'll take the economist.
- That happened fast.

580
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,614
You can get in touch
with Mike Tapley.

581
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:30,750
I'd like to use a guy
named Cyrus West.

582
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,252
Jim uses Tapley
for military analysis.

583
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,687
Yeah, I know, but I think
you're gonna like Cyrus West.

584
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:36,222
He's a retired
Air Force captain,

585
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:38,257
<i>teaches public policy
at the Maxwell School,</i>

586
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:40,426
and he's a hard-liner
on drones.

587
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,795
You're sure you don't
want to use Tapley?

588
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:45,264
Got to start
producing sometime.

589
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,433
All right.
Start now.

590
00:26:47,468 --> 00:26:49,335
We've got a rundown meeting.

591
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:55,208
- Drone strike.
<i>- Hey.</i>

592
00:26:55,242 --> 00:26:56,943
Keep your eye on Jerry for me.

593
00:26:56,977 --> 00:26:59,045
I think he wants
to win a Peabody.

594
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,813
Who's Jerry?

595
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:02,849
Okay.

596
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:09,288
Ben Furusho jumped from the second story
of a Holiday Inn in Nashua.

597
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:11,791
I've been in that room.
He didn't make it, right?

598
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:13,159
No, he's out
for a couple of weeks.

599
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:15,294
Jim drove up last night
to cover for him.

600
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,831
So say hello to Jerry Dantana,
who most of you already know.

601
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:20,800
- Hey, Jerry.
- Jim went on the Romney bus?

602
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,502
- He wanted to go.
<i>- Why?</i>

603
00:27:22,603 --> 00:27:25,271
For the experience
and to be a team player.

604
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:27,907
Couldn't you make the argument
that he just left the team?

605
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:29,709
You could.
Do you want to?

606
00:27:29,743 --> 00:27:31,878
- Not this second, but--
- Seriously, what's going on?

607
00:27:31,912 --> 00:27:33,379
Ben Furusho broke his ankle.

608
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:35,314
Jim's covering for him
for a couple of weeks

609
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:37,016
and Jerry's up from DC
to cover for Jim.

610
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,351
He's gonna produce a panel
tonight in the B or C block.

611
00:27:39,386 --> 00:27:41,420
- B would be great.
- What everyone's asking

612
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:44,122
- is why would a senior producer--
- No. No.

613
00:27:44,157 --> 00:27:45,857
<i>The clock's run out
on this conversation.</i>

614
00:27:45,892 --> 00:27:47,659
If I'm gonna sit in
on our rundown meetings,

615
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:49,261
they can't get mired
in these kind of detours.

616
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:51,563
It's like playing golf behind
a foursome of blind people.

617
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:53,866
Also, Don will be in
our rundown meetings.

618
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,169
<i>Charlie wants us doing
more cross-network stories.</i>

619
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:58,104
So think of 10:00
as our second act.

620
00:27:58,138 --> 00:28:00,539
- Or 8:00 as our warm-up.
- How should we think about 9:00?

621
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:02,842
It's Washington.
It doesn't matter.

622
00:28:02,909 --> 00:28:05,411
That's not something we think.

623
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:07,880
- They're on speaker.
- Huh?

624
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:13,252
- You guys there?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

625
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:16,890
The search for Gaddafi
continues.

626
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:19,693
Journalists and dignitaries
are being freed from the Rixos Hotel,

627
00:28:19,794 --> 00:28:22,296
and Mustafa Abdul Jalil
is offering what amounts

628
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,899
to a million and a half dollars
and amnesty to anyone who finds Gaddafi.

629
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:27,935
- Did he call anyone?
- Did Gaddafi call anyone?

630
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:30,137
- Jim.
- He hasn't run away from home.

631
00:28:30,238 --> 00:28:32,239
- He called me last night.
<i>- Tamara.</i>

632
00:28:32,274 --> 00:28:34,575
The earthquake was a 5.8
and AP is reporting

633
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:36,210
it caused a crack in
the Washington Monument,

634
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:38,779
- <i>which will now be closed indefinitely.</i>
- What else?

635
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:41,949
PPP has Rick Perry at 22
and Romney at 19.

636
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:44,618
- Tess?
- Steve Jobs is going to officially resign today.

637
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:46,553
Let's close with that.
Martin?

638
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:48,255
<i>BP's paid five billion in
claims to compensate victims</i>

639
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:51,692
and the deficit reduction committee
is launching a website for public input.

640
00:28:51,726 --> 00:28:53,627
Public input on deficit reduction.
I feel better already.

641
00:28:53,661 --> 00:28:55,562
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

642
00:28:55,597 --> 00:28:57,698
And are you very sure
you want to pitch this?

643
00:28:57,732 --> 00:29:01,102
- Yes.
<i>- Bring it.</i>

644
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:04,338
About 11 weeks ago,
June 9, the domain name

645
00:29:04,372 --> 00:29:05,806
occupywallstreet
was registered.

646
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:07,909
And?

647
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:09,844
I believe America
is on the verge

648
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:11,780
of starting
its own Arab Spring.

649
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:13,182
Really?

650
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,451
Yeah.

651
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:20,123
Gaddafi, drones.
Let's keep working the others

652
00:29:20,157 --> 00:29:21,958
and I'll make
my first cut to the two.

653
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:26,329
It was registered by Adbusters
and they sent out an e-mail saying,

654
00:29:26,363 --> 00:29:29,031
- "America needs its own Tahrir."
- We call them elections.

655
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,467
Hang on. On July 13,
Adbusters sends an e-mail

656
00:29:31,502 --> 00:29:34,504
to 90,000 people telling them
to gather on September 17.

657
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:37,273
That's roughly three weeks from now
at the charging bull on Wall Street.

658
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:39,709
The e-mail goes viral
in 15 minutes.

659
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,177
New websites were formed
and there's been instant

660
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:44,013
and substantial support
across Twitter and Reddit.

661
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,182
August 2,
they staged their first organizing meeting

662
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,984
and have been holding
weekly planning meetings,

663
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:49,620
which they call
general assemblies.

664
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,222
They always start
by making a new language.

665
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:52,857
50 to 100 people
have been showing up.

666
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,725
50 people out of
an e-mail blast to 90,000?

667
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,160
50 to 100.

668
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,597
And is there a list of incoherent
and unrealistic demands?

669
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,665
Just one thing and
it's perfectly coherent.

670
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,501
A presidential commission
to get money out of politics.

671
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,404
Come with me.

672
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,641
Here's a fax I get every day.

673
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,344
It's the protests that are
going on in New York,

674
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,778
just New York.

675
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,348
Today, Jews Say No

676
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,618
are protesting the air attacks
on the Gaza Strip.

677
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,453
Topless protestors are
demanding that lawmakers

678
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,221
repeal codes
against toplessness.

679
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:27,291
On the East River,
residents are protesting the building

680
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,226
of a high-rise
near a soccer field,

681
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,795
and union members
are protesting

682
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,030
the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters' new leadership.

683
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,967
And at any given moment,
a group is protesting

684
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,068
ads in the subway,
standardized tests,

685
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,204
horse-drawn carriages,
and fracking.

686
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,172
<i>I know how much you want this,</i>

687
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:44,840
and I like how much
you're going for it,

688
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,209
but you've gotta wait
until something's real.

689
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,414
All right.

690
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,593
- Neal.
- Yeah?

691
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:07,595
- What was it called again?
- Occupy Wall Street.

692
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,165
- When's the next general assembly?
- Tonight.

693
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:13,401
- You should go.
- Sure.

694
00:31:22,978 --> 00:31:24,813
A minute ago,
your issue was with legality.

695
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:26,414
Now it's with the morality.

696
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:29,084
I'm able to hold as many as
two thoughts in my head at once.

697
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:30,318
The Fifth Amendment--

698
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:32,254
The Fifth Amendment,
like all the other amendments,

699
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:33,755
guarantees certain rights
to US citizens.

700
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,891
<i>If an American vacationing</i>

701
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:38,360
in the Khyber Pass gets
targeted by a Predator...

702
00:31:38,394 --> 00:31:41,463
We need to ask are we creating
more terrorists than we're killing?

703
00:31:41,498 --> 00:31:44,734
- We need to ask...
- We don't know exactly what that collateral damage is

704
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:47,370
because of the lack of
any transparency or accountability.

705
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:49,939
Now factor in that the BDA,
the bomb damage assessment,

706
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,642
counts all military-aged
males as militants.

707
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:55,912
- But to your second point, the fact that drones are...
- Aren't they cheaper?

708
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,615
I prefer to be arguing the legality
and the morality, but, no, they're not.

709
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,919
<i>An F-16 costs 50 million
and a drone costs 30.</i>

710
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,488
But we procure the drones
in groups of four--

711
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:05,789
<i>combat air patrols, or CAPs.</i>

712
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:08,659
<i>We buy them as a set,
so it's 120 million</i>

713
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,627
<i>versus 50 million
for the Falcon.</i>

714
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,062
<i>What we should
be talking about...</i>

715
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,730
...costs in terms
of human lives.

716
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,033
- That's about all I can stand.
- Here we go.

717
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,836
I've had all I can stands
and I can't stands no more.

718
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,505
<i>- Did you want to jump in, Captain?</i>
- I do.

719
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,442
Because my concern is with
the cost of American lives,

720
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,976
here and in combat.

721
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:29,847
<i>Sloan, you didn't mention
that a $50 million F-16</i>

722
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,450
has to be flown by a pilot
who is somebody's father

723
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,486
<i>and that he can be shot down by
a shoulder-mounted, point-and-shoot Stinger.</i>

724
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:38,355
Now, Dr. Cochran,
I can appreciate that you're an ethicist,

725
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,291
but we don't face
an ethical dilemma.

726
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,892
<i>Can a drone distinguish between</i>

727
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,527
<i>an Al Qaeda operative
and a goat herder?</i>

728
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,563
<i>I don't care
and neither should you.</i>

729
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,298
- Get in there, Will.
<i>- And as for the legality,</i>

730
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,867
the authorization for
the use of military force...

731
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:53,470
Ask him if the AUMF said we were at war
with terrorists or the Pakistani civilians.

732
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,338
<i>...authorized the president
to pursue terrorists</i>

733
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,274
<i>with all necessary
appropriate force.</i>

734
00:32:58,308 --> 00:32:59,842
<i>Drones represent the safest
form of lethal action</i>

735
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,611
against terrorist targets,
period.

736
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:03,913
- It's more complicated than that.
- Period.

737
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:05,981
Ask him about the AUMF.

738
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:09,084
<i>...AQ and Taliban senior
leadership in Afghanistan,</i>

739
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,819
Pakistan, Yemen,

740
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:12,621
and the Horn of Africa, period.

741
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:15,591
- Get in.
- So, naturally, here comes the Human Rights Watch...

742
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,226
AUMF.

743
00:33:18,261 --> 00:33:21,029
<i>The United Nations treaty
on international humanism--</i>

744
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:23,899
The UN gets four blocks
of free parking

745
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:25,535
on the east side
of Manhattan and that's it.

746
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,871
- That's not it.
- Period.

747
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,006
<i>We're going to have
to end this there.</i>

748
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,576
This is <i>News Night</i>.
We'll be back right after this.

749
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,679
<i>2:30 back.</i>

750
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,317
I like to use the full
range of punctuation--

751
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,652
commas, colons, parentheses.

752
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:44,988
- He was trying to get noticed.
- No shit.

753
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,288
Why'd Will go quiet?
I teed him up--

754
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:48,290
Will's not your problem.
The panel's your problem.

755
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:49,992
I'll have a word with him.
He's very good.

756
00:33:50,093 --> 00:33:51,360
Use Jim's guys.

757
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:54,864
Yep. I will.

758
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:04,440
<i>Two minutes.</i>

759
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:08,811
- Good?
- What was with period, period?

760
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,880
- I meant it.
- Cy, you're a little over the top.

761
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:12,381
Somebody say something?
Did Will say something?

762
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,083
- No, he's still on the air.
- I'm gonna get asked back?

763
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:16,419
It's not up to me.

764
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,625
All right.

765
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:25,261
I'm gonna give you a story now.

766
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:28,164
I'm gonna give you
a name to call,

767
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:30,333
but you have to use me
to help you follow it.

768
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:31,768
What kind of story?

769
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:34,838
You have to use me
to help you follow it.

770
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,508
What kind of story?

771
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,178
The kind that makes careers
and ends presidencies.

772
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,884
Look, man,

773
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,753
I'm trying to help you,
but you've been fucked up since--

774
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:51,021
I'm trying to help you.

775
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,490
I'm trying to help you.

776
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,362
Makes careers
and ends presidencies?

777
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,264
A black op called Genoa.

778
00:35:02,933 --> 00:35:05,835
That's <i>News Night</i>
for August 24, 2011.

779
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:08,371
Terry Smith is coming up next
with <i>The Capitol Report</i>,

780
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:11,207
followed by Sloan Sabbith
filling in on <i>Right Now</i>.

781
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,309
I'm Will McAvoy.
Good night.

782
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,984
<i>And clear.</i>

783
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,095
You know what?
I agreed with everything he said.

784
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,831
- How about the way he said it?
- It wasn't my style, but...

785
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:36,800
The AUMF-- you were able
to hear me, right?

786
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:37,934
There didn't seem
to be an opening.

787
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:39,168
You didn't have
a problem making one

788
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,537
when you went to break
41 seconds early.

789
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:43,472
Sorry about that.

790
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:52,248
- Good show.
- Thanks.

791
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:53,883
- Good night.
- Good job.

792
00:35:58,155 --> 00:35:59,855
<i>- Hey, everyone.
- Good to see you.</i>

793
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,091
If there are no announcements,
we'll get started.

794
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,360
No announcements?

795
00:36:04,394 --> 00:36:07,263
Okay, I see some new faces,
so I have to say up front,

796
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:09,365
no police and no reporters.

797
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:12,668
Everybody?

798
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:16,839
Dude.

799
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,342
- Me?
- You're wearing ACN credentials.

800
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:24,113
Yeah, that was pretty stupid.

801
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:26,581
My name is Neal Sampat
and I'm with ACN

802
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:28,416
and I'd love to observe
the meeting.

803
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:30,051
No journalists.
No exceptions.

804
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:31,887
Do you mind if I ask
a question?

805
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:37,459
Question?

806
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:40,095
Why wouldn't you want to get the word out
about the sit-in on the 17th?

807
00:36:40,129 --> 00:36:41,964
I'm John, and we don't
call it a sit-in.

808
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,899
Why wouldn't you want
to get the word out?

809
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:45,567
We do, we just don't
need your help to do it.

810
00:36:45,602 --> 00:36:47,236
We want to make sure,
no offense, our message is clear

811
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,838
before it's distorted
by the press.

812
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,673
Your message was clear
in the e-mail blast.

813
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,308
You want private money
out of politics.

814
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,377
- We may want more than that.
- We do want more than that.

815
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:56,947
Can I ask--

816
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,649
Yeah.

817
00:36:58,683 --> 00:36:59,850
Are you in charge?

818
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,387
My name's Shelly
and no one's in charge.

819
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,489
<i>The findings were bleak</i>

820
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:07,826
with results showing that less than
half of high schoolers

821
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:09,828
were able to correctly
identify the century

822
00:37:09,863 --> 00:37:12,230
in which the Civil War
was fought.

823
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:15,367
One in four thought Columbus
discovered the New World

824
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,969
<i>sometime after 1750.</i>

825
00:37:18,004 --> 00:37:19,905
<i>And if the Bill of Rights
were abolished,</i>

826
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:21,840
a third of high school students

827
00:37:21,874 --> 00:37:24,342
wouldn't be able to name
a right they just lost.

828
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,344
Things get worse in Oklahoma...

829
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:28,446
- They almost always do.
<i>- ...where a majority of high school students</i>

830
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,814
<i>failed the test
given to immigrants</i>

831
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:32,182
<i>seeking to become
naturalized citizens.</i>

832
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,151
Three-fourths couldn't name
the first US president...

833
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,686
- Ben Franklin. Nailed it.
- ...and only a third knew

834
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,721
the term length
of a House member.

835
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,757
- On that note...
- That's all for Wednesday, August 24.

836
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,193
I'm Sloan Sabbith
filling in for Elliot Hirsch.

837
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,528
- Have a good night.
- Good show.

838
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:49,199
- We're clear.
- You don't have to say it like that.

839
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,568
I said it the regular way.

840
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,138
- Great show.
- You saw it?

841
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:57,007
I've got it DVR'd.

842
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,209
Listen, was Will okay
on the panel tonight?

843
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,578
Sure.

844
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,346
You and me?

845
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,882
I don't know why
he didn't jump in

846
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:06,550
on the AUMF door
the guy opened.

847
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,953
I don't know why he didn't cut him off
or throw it to the ethicist.

848
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:12,156
He seemed to want to make sure
it was clear ACN is antiterrorist.

849
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,192
Maybe he was just
getting out of the way.

850
00:38:15,227 --> 00:38:16,861
Yeah.

851
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,563
- Good show tonight.
- You saw it?

852
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,498
- <i>Keep it up.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,007
So...

854
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,744
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah.

855
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:37,415
And you know you're
not speaking right now?

856
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,950
When you asked me
why I was single

857
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,852
and I said it was because
you hadn't asked me out,

858
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,721
- I thought it was my last day.
- I know.

859
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:45,356
And, honestly,
it just sounded like a good line.

860
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:47,425
I hardly ever land those.

861
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,060
I took it as a joke.

862
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:50,662
- You did?
- Yeah.

863
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:53,132
I mean, it was.
Good.

864
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,167
All right.

865
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:57,203
All right.

866
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:59,072
I'm heading home.

867
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:02,075
I've got a 13-day streak going
of being a good boyfriend.

868
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:03,777
What do you get
if you hit two weeks?

869
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:06,747
A healthy conscience.

870
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:10,584
See you tomorrow.

871
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:12,686
See you tomorrow.

872
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:16,923
- Tell me about yourself.
- You tell me about yourself.

873
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:19,424
I run our show's website

874
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:21,993
and I'm trying to get my EP
interested in this story.

875
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,328
Why isn't he
interested already?

876
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,363
She.
It's not that she's not interested.

877
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,265
She's just waiting
for it to happen

878
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,200
and I'd rather get in
on the ground floor.

879
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:31,102
She doesn't like ground floors?

880
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:33,538
She doesn't think there's
gonna be a second floor.

881
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,040
That's all right.

882
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:36,909
I still don't have
your last name.

883
00:39:36,976 --> 00:39:38,944
I'm Shelly Wexler.

884
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:42,815
I'm a PhD candidate in anthropology
at NYU, where I also teach.

885
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,184
Is this your first
experience with activism?

886
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,621
When I was a minor
I was arrested in Seattle

887
00:39:47,655 --> 00:39:49,322
at the WTO protests.

888
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:51,257
By minor you mean you were...

889
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:53,893
Not coal.
Minor, under 18.

890
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:56,462
Okay, were you
involved in Seattle?

891
00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:58,431
- Were you involved in the--
- In the violence? No.

892
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:00,866
I'm nonviolent,
as is Occupy Wall Street.

893
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:08,440
"On September 17,
we want to see 20,000 flood

894
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:11,176
into Lower Manhattan,
set up tents, kitchens,

895
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:13,879
peaceful barricades
and occupy Wall Street."

896
00:40:13,913 --> 00:40:15,180
Then what?

897
00:40:15,214 --> 00:40:17,249
We stay until
our demands are met--

898
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:20,653
the arrest and prosecution of the people
responsible for the crash,

899
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,922
the formation of
a presidential commission

900
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:24,857
to investigate
corruption in politics,

901
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:26,793
the ratification of
a constitutional amendment

902
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:29,662
outlawing the legal designation
of "corporate personhood."

903
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:32,365
You're gonna sleep in a park
until a constitutional amendment

904
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,233
is ratified by three-quarters
of the states?

905
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:36,302
We mean business, Neal.

906
00:40:37,638 --> 00:40:39,338
What's with the hand signals?

907
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:40,706
It's a Quaker tradition

908
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:42,342
and a peaceful way
of maintaining order

909
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:44,344
when your movement
has no leaders.

910
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:46,212
Doesn't a movement
need leaders?

911
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,947
We believe in
a horizontal structure.

912
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:52,785
Are you worried that
the horizontal structure

913
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,388
is gonna give power to people
who shouldn't have it?

914
00:40:55,422 --> 00:40:56,689
You mean Joel and John?

915
00:40:56,723 --> 00:40:59,125
Shelly, you started off

916
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,061
with one clear
and not unreasonable demand

917
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:05,497
and now you've got,
like, 14 of them,

918
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:07,732
including arresting Bear Stearns
and the Lehman Brothers.

919
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:09,534
You doing a story
or giving advice?

920
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:13,238
I haven't been assigned the story,
so I'm giving advice.

921
00:41:13,272 --> 00:41:15,974
And you can't have a protest
unless the media's covering it.

922
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:18,009
The media is gonna cover it.

923
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:20,178
But they're gonna cover
the drum circles

924
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:22,748
and crunchy, uninformed college kids
yelling at the earners,

925
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:25,984
who, coincidently, are the same guys
running Time Warner News Corp.

926
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:27,853
and AWM.

927
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:30,323
You don't have the patience
for complicated things.

928
00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:31,858
I do.

929
00:41:31,892 --> 00:41:33,993
Then why do you take
Wall Street bullshit

930
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:35,962
like limited government
seriously?

931
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,198
You and I and God
and everybody knows

932
00:41:38,232 --> 00:41:39,733
that the banks couldn't
survive until lunch

933
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:42,069
without zero interest loans
from the government

934
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:44,604
and bailouts when they bet
a hard eight and lose.

935
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:47,507
There was straight-up fraud
and you covered Casey Anthony.

936
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:49,676
In our defense,
we were the last ones to do that.

937
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,678
That's a lame defense.

938
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:54,080
Where was Will McAvoy
when Goldman sold its clients

939
00:41:54,115 --> 00:41:56,382
mortgage-related securities
without disclosing

940
00:41:56,417 --> 00:42:00,153
that the hedge fund manager who chose
the mortgages was betting on them to fail?

941
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:02,455
Or when Citigroup sold
its clients a mortgage fund

942
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,224
with securities
it knew would fail

943
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:06,426
so the banks could bet
against its customers?

944
00:42:06,461 --> 00:42:08,495
Citigroup made 160 million

945
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,964
off its investors
losing 700 million.

946
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:14,068
I expect I'll see your cameras
the first time girls go wild,

947
00:42:14,102 --> 00:42:16,770
but until then, frankly,
I just don't trust you

948
00:42:16,805 --> 00:42:18,906
to get a fucking story
anywhere close to right,

949
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,008
especially one
with distractions.

950
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:23,377
I want this to succeed.

951
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:26,047
Then you're on the wrong side
of the camera.

952
00:42:29,217 --> 00:42:31,886
Sooner or later,
you're gonna want this.

953
00:42:33,088 --> 00:42:35,290
Go back to one clear message

954
00:42:35,324 --> 00:42:37,759
or you guys
are gonna be a joke.

955
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,028
You can bring that up
at the next meeting.

956
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:43,031
I'll show you the hand signal.

957
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:05,486
Sorry. Sorry.

958
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:07,889
- Go back to sleep.
- What's going on?

959
00:43:07,923 --> 00:43:09,924
It's okay.

960
00:43:12,395 --> 00:43:13,929
Honey, what are you doing?

961
00:43:13,963 --> 00:43:15,464
I'm just grabbing
a couple of things.

962
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:17,466
I'm gonna be at the Sheraton
on 7th Avenue, okay?

963
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,935
- What?
<i>- It's all right.</i>

964
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,105
- No, no. What's going on?
- I don't want you to--

965
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:24,708
- I don't want you to get upset.
- Wait.

966
00:43:24,742 --> 00:43:27,411
Did you just say
you're going to a hotel?

967
00:43:27,445 --> 00:43:29,680
Yeah, I called Lisa.
Everything's fine.

968
00:43:29,714 --> 00:43:31,548
- <i>Wait.</i>
- You can move back into your old place,

969
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,984
but I figured it would take a few days
and I wanted to give you some room.

970
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:35,419
You have to slow down
and tell me--

971
00:43:35,453 --> 00:43:39,290
I came home and you were asleep

972
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:41,926
and I was at the computer
for a little while and I got an e-mail.

973
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,062
Your cousin sent me an e-mail
with a link to a YouTube video.

974
00:43:46,198 --> 00:43:47,965
What does YouTube
have to do with--

975
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,134
what's going on?
Why are you going to a hotel?

976
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:53,304
Why are you packing?
Slow everything down so I can--

977
00:43:53,338 --> 00:43:55,172
<i>...writing her 800-word column</i>

978
00:43:55,207 --> 00:43:56,874
<i>for a newspaper
no one's ever heard of,</i>

979
00:43:56,909 --> 00:44:00,478
but I just spent my last $7
having a fight with my best friend,

980
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:03,415
who, by the way,
isn't available at 3:00 PM

981
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:05,484
<i>on a Wednesday to console me
about some guy</i>

982
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:07,819
<i>because she too has a job.</i>

983
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,888
<i>And mostly,
when you fall for a guy</i>

984
00:44:09,923 --> 00:44:11,891
<i>and he's going out
with your best friend,</i>

985
00:44:11,925 --> 00:44:13,559
<i>it doesn't work out.</i>

986
00:44:13,594 --> 00:44:15,061
<i>Things get really--</i>

987
00:44:18,566 --> 00:44:20,367
Shit.

988
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:22,202
Just stand there, okay?

989
00:44:22,236 --> 00:44:24,037
'Cause this isn't
what it looks--

990
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:28,074
Why are you laughing?

991
00:44:28,108 --> 00:44:30,877
Oh, if you can't
laugh at this...

992
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:33,413
I mean,

993
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:35,782
if I weren't a cast member
in this story,

994
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:38,318
I'd think it was pretty funny.

995
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:40,687
It's on YouTube, Maggie.
You're a news producer.

996
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:42,255
You didn't think that
on a busload of tourists,

997
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:43,523
somebody wasn't
gonna record that?

998
00:44:43,557 --> 00:44:45,892
- Please let me explain.
<i>- Nah.</i>

999
00:44:47,228 --> 00:44:49,196
I spent this whole time
thinking I was a bad guy

1000
00:44:49,264 --> 00:44:50,464
for not being in love with you,

1001
00:44:50,498 --> 00:44:53,367
- but it turns out--
- Don't say that.

1002
00:44:55,403 --> 00:44:58,505
I know that Jim
was on the thing.

1003
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:00,507
He heard you say all that.

1004
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:02,809
My cousin told you?

1005
00:45:02,844 --> 00:45:05,312
She doesn't like you.

1006
00:45:05,346 --> 00:45:08,048
And she has a crush on me.

1007
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:11,418
She's gonna get married
and stab her husband one day,

1008
00:45:11,453 --> 00:45:13,320
but that's beside the point.

1009
00:45:15,123 --> 00:45:17,191
- Lisa--
- I didn't tell Lisa about the video.

1010
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:19,660
I just told her
it didn't work out.

1011
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:23,230
You should call Jim.

1012
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:26,267
Tell him to get off
the fucking bus.

1013
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:28,336
We're trying to do the news.

1014
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:32,674
I should be the one to leave.

1015
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:36,077
Come on.
I should really be the one to leave.

1016
00:45:38,781 --> 00:45:40,682
Take it easy, Maggie.

1017
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:07,769
Why'd I get hit in my head?

1018
00:46:07,837 --> 00:46:09,638
- I want to pursue drones.
- You won't catch them.

1019
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:11,773
- They fly pretty fast.
- Ha ha. Yeah, yeah.

1020
00:46:11,807 --> 00:46:13,307
- Jameson rocks?
- Thanks.

1021
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:15,109
I don't think there's
an immoral way to kill terrorists.

1022
00:46:15,143 --> 00:46:17,377
- There's an illegal way and we're doing it.
- I don't care.

1023
00:46:17,412 --> 00:46:19,880
'Cause you were taken off
the 9/11 anniversary coverage?

1024
00:46:19,914 --> 00:46:21,748
- Yes!
- I knew you were upset.

1025
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:23,449
Of course I'm--
Are you kidding me?

1026
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:26,285
I'm flipping out!

1027
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:34,091
- Holy shit, Mac. What the fuck did I do?
- I know. It feels bad.

1028
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,193
I used to be exactly the person
that you wanted to see in these moments.

1029
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,695
- I don't mean the old days. Like a year ago.
- I know.

1030
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,297
- You still are.
- I remind people of the enemy? Jesus!

1031
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,133
Every blond-haired guy
from Nebraska

1032
00:46:44,167 --> 00:46:46,202
reminds people of Muslim extremists.
There's nothing you can do.

1033
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:48,504
- Don't try to make me laugh.
- You can blame it all on me.

1034
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:50,205
If there was a way
to blame it on you,

1035
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,141
don't you think I would
have done that by now?

1036
00:46:52,175 --> 00:46:53,308
I've got Roger Daltrey
screaming,

1037
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,510
"You better, you better,
you bet" in my ear.

1038
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:58,046
- Why?
- "You better, you better, you bet."

1039
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,115
It's about a really deman--
Know British rock.

1040
00:47:00,149 --> 00:47:01,582
Why can't there be
British rock?

1041
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,818
No, K-N-O-W.
Know British rock.

1042
00:47:04,853 --> 00:47:06,887
"When I say I love you,
you say you better.

1043
00:47:06,922 --> 00:47:08,622
You better,
you better, you bet."

1044
00:47:08,656 --> 00:47:11,058
Why is Daltrey screaming
that in your ear?

1045
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,130
It feels like the relationship I have
with the audience.

1046
00:47:16,164 --> 00:47:18,232
You can't believe
what this feels like.

1047
00:47:20,836 --> 00:47:23,236
As a matter of fact, I can.

1048
00:47:23,271 --> 00:47:25,939
- I got that.
- Did you?

1049
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:31,574
Were you really in bed
when I called last night?

1050
00:47:31,609 --> 00:47:33,810
Yeah.

1051
00:47:33,844 --> 00:47:35,745
It's Pete Townshend.

1052
00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:39,182
Townshend wrote the song,
Daltrey's singing it.

1053
00:47:39,216 --> 00:47:41,250
When does Jim come back?

1054
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:42,485
Couple of weeks.

1055
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,722
Oh, what can possibly happen
in a couple of weeks?

1056
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:48,286
Let's finish our drink.

1057
00:47:51,424 --> 00:47:54,527
"When I say I love you, you say you better."
That person's just mean.

1058
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:57,529
- Are you able to notice the irony?
- I see the irony.

1059
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:01,700
I'm gonna pay for these.
She'll take the Jameson to go.

1060
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:04,403
"I don't really mind how much you love me.
A little is all right."

1061
00:48:04,437 --> 00:48:06,438
You get that in a completely
different context

1062
00:48:06,473 --> 00:48:09,542
Roger Daltrey could be me
singing what I'm--

1063
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:11,343
- What I would sing--
- You're saying it works on different levels.

1064
00:48:11,377 --> 00:48:14,346
Your relationship with strangers
or my relationship with you?

1065
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,014
- The first one.
- I don't think either of us

1066
00:48:16,048 --> 00:48:18,083
have the first idea
what that song's about.

1067
00:48:20,153 --> 00:48:22,888
AUMF.

1068
00:48:22,922 --> 00:48:25,758
I've never seen you leave
a rebuttal that fat on the table.

1069
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:28,094
- I don't care whose side you're on.
- I know.

1070
00:48:28,128 --> 00:48:31,063
Don't do it again.
And I can pay for my own drinks, pal o' mine.

1071
00:48:31,098 --> 00:48:32,798
- Fine.
- Damn right it's fine.

1072
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:35,034
I said fine.

1073
00:48:35,068 --> 00:48:37,169
I left my purse
up at the office.

1074
00:48:43,043 --> 00:48:45,078
And I'll need
some cash for the cab.

1075
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:51,818
And for the cab
tomorrow morning.

1076
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,061
<i>If Ben Furusho
hadn't broken his ankle,</i>

1077
00:49:02,129 --> 00:49:04,097
if Jim hadn't gone
to cover for him,

1078
00:49:04,132 --> 00:49:06,533
if Dantana hadn't come up
to cover for Jim,

1079
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:08,735
if Mike Tapley

1080
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,038
<i>had been on the panel
instead of Cyrus West,</i>

1081
00:49:11,105 --> 00:49:13,440
if I'd caught it

1082
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:15,308
before instead
of after--

1083
00:49:15,342 --> 00:49:17,143
God damn it!

1084
00:49:21,948 --> 00:49:24,249
<i>You know, nobody believed
Genoa at first.</i>

1085
00:49:24,283 --> 00:49:27,952
It was impossible to believe.

1086
00:49:27,987 --> 00:49:29,754
But...

1087
00:49:29,788 --> 00:49:32,757
<i>piece by piece,
the evidence started coming in</i>

1088
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:36,027
and suddenly it was
impossible to deny.

1089
00:49:38,063 --> 00:49:40,664
It was the biggest thing
any of us had ever touched.

1090
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:43,668
Including Charlie.
It was...

1091
00:49:43,702 --> 00:49:46,304
the Pentagon Papers and we were
the only ones who had it.

1092
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:51,009
We average about
1.5 million viewers.

1093
00:49:51,043 --> 00:49:53,278
Genoa got 5.5 million.

1094
00:49:55,314 --> 00:49:58,383
It was the most viewed program
in the history of cable news.

1095
00:49:59,919 --> 00:50:03,756
So, yeah, definitely,

1096
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:05,925
if Ben Furusho
had landed in the pool

1097
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:08,127
instead of on the pavement,

1098
00:50:08,161 --> 00:50:10,362
we wouldn't be talking
right now.

1099
00:50:10,397 --> 00:50:13,199
And Will wouldn't be
standing out in the hallway.

1100
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:15,301
He's there, right?

1101
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,574
It's because I'm in here.

1102
00:50:24,378 --> 00:50:25,946
He's worried
he got me in trouble

1103
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:28,582
and not the other way around.

1104
00:50:28,616 --> 00:50:31,618
And you've got to admit,
for a guy who lives to be liked by the audience,

1105
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,887
he lets us put his life
in danger a lot.

1106
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,727
When I was little,

1107
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:43,563
I asked my uncle
how much a lawyer costs.

1108
00:50:44,665 --> 00:50:47,333
He said if it's bad, £300.

1109
00:50:47,367 --> 00:50:49,635
If it's really bad, £400.

1110
00:50:49,669 --> 00:50:52,405
And if it's really bad
and you're guilty...

1111
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,741
How much do you cost?

1112
00:50:55,775 --> 00:50:58,510
1,500 an hour.

1113
00:51:04,785 --> 00:51:07,052
It's after midnight.
Are you okay?

1114
00:51:08,388 --> 00:51:11,156
- Yeah.
