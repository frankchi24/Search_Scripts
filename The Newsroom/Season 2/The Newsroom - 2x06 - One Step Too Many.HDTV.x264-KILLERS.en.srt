1
00:00:00,294 --> 00:00:02,715
You have questions about my--
About drinking and men?

2
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:04,550
- You want to warn me about something?
- No.

3
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:06,552
I'm afraid to sleep
alone at night,

4
00:00:06,587 --> 00:00:08,888
so sometimes I go out.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,024
- Will is not aware of Genoa.
- Do you mind if I ask why not?

6
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,173
Because I might need him
for the red team.

7
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:17,932
Look, it's a completely
unbelievable story.

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,685
<i>If you believe it
enough to be thinking</i>

9
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,420
about a red team,
you believe it enough.

10
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,322
- What do you got?
- Some bullshit on Twitter.

11
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,758
Look, I get that it's stupid,
but it has an effect.

12
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,626
And we haven't been getting
the bounces lately.

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,195
- What was the third tweet?
- "You just lost a viewer."

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,731
Is this the right time to ask
why you date men like this?

15
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,834
You're saying I knew he was like this,
but didn't care?

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,437
I'm saying you don't have a very high opinion
of yourself and I don't get it.

17
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,805
You're impressive.

18
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,041
Operation Genoa--
This is the first piece of paper

19
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,275
<i>we've seen with that name.</i>

20
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,133
It happened
and we're gonna prove it.

21
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:53,678
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

22
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,887
<i>Here's where we are.</i>

23
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,389
<i>August 24 of last year
we had a guest on a panel</i>

24
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,658
<i>about drones named Cyrus West,</i>

25
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,127
<i>a retired Air Force captain</i>

26
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,162
<i>who now teaches
at the Maxwell School.</i>

27
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,732
When the panel was done,
Captain West gave Jerry a tip

28
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,068
about a black op
with the codename Genoa.

29
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,203
What did he tell you
about Genoa?

30
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,572
He told me that in March 2009,
two Marines

31
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,875
were separated from
their unit in the Hindu Kush.

32
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,512
<i>Intelligence told us that they were
captured by Taliban fighters,</i>

33
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,615
taken across the border into Pakistan,
held in a small village,

34
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,351
and in a matter of a few hours
they were gonna be sold

35
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,186
to Al-Qaeda
and publically beheaded.

36
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,055
A MARSOC unit
was deployed to attempt an extraction.

37
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,926
Two MH-60s, Black Hawks,
came in with 15 MARSOCs apiece.

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,795
The first unit was overrun by the enemy
and trapped behind cover.

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,297
<i>They were wearing MOPP gear.</i>

40
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,632
Mission Oriented
Protective Posture.

41
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,133
The second unit,
also in MOPP gear,

42
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,502
came in and successfully
extracted the prisoners

43
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,304
<i>as well as the first
MARSOC unit.</i>

44
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,174
- How?
- By dropping sarin gas on the village.

45
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,216
How would the prisoners
have survived?

46
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,151
We hit them with atropine
and dragged them onto the helos.

47
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,953
- Everyone else was wearing MOPP gear.
- Everyone but the civilians.

48
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,190
That was Cyrus West's story
and that was last August.

49
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,927
Jerry then tracked down a retired
gunnery sergeant, Eric Sweeney.

50
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,528
Jerry and I met
with Sgt. Sweeney

51
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,330
and the full transcript
of that meeting

52
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,166
<i>begins on page four
in your binders.</i>

53
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,168
<i>Sweeney describes rehearsals
for the mission...</i>

54
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,470
- In MOPP gear.
- ...and then describes the mission itself.

55
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,707
<i>He witnesses blinding smoke
and women and children</i>

56
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:30,375
<i>with boils and burns
on their faces.</i>

57
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,344
Back on the helicopter
he asks another member of his crew

58
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,646
what that was all about
and he's told it was sarin.

59
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,782
<i>Jerry put a team together
to track down other members</i>

60
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,885
<i>of the crew and any ground support,
but no one was talking.</i>

61
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,554
<i>Neal then did a search
of any tweets from the area</i>

62
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,457
sent around March '09
and came up with Hamni8.

63
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,326
The tweets from Hamni8
would seem to be describing

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,462
what we'd heard from Sgt. Sweeney
and from Cyrus West.

65
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,930
"Helicopters. Grenades."

66
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,099
<i>Then a moment later,
"Men in gas masks. Machine guns."</i>

67
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:57,436
<i>A moment later, "Burning."
Then, "Americans. White smoke."</i>

68
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,038
Then, "Two helicopters.
No markings on them, but they're American."

69
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,374
It's 32 minutes
before the next tweet.

70
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,109
<i>"I think everyone's dead."</i>

71
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,844
<i>We believe the reason
for the 32-minute gap</i>

72
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,212
<i>is frequency hopping.</i>

73
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,981
We'd have jammed
the radio frequencies cell phones use.

74
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,783
West is one, Sweeney is two,
Hamni8 is three.

75
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,187
Four is a humanitarian report
from a guy named Leon Deit.

76
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,423
Deit was in the region
working for an NGO

77
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,592
and traveled to the site
of the extraction

78
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,661
on verbal reports
of a mass grave.

79
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,664
<i>The eyewitness accounts
are consistent with the use of sarin gas.</i>

80
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,700
And as you can see,
the report includes

81
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,202
<i>pictures of the victims.</i>

82
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:33,739
Five is a confidential source
who confirmed the story

83
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,608
and provided a copy
of the munitions manifest.

84
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,045
The manifest included this item--
MX-76.

85
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,047
<i>MX-76 doesn't exist.</i>

86
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,316
<i>It's a euphemism for
classified material.</i>

87
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,119
We believe
it's the sarin canisters.

88
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,354
<i>The five of us
as well as some other staffers</i>

89
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,123
<i>have had a role in putting
this together so far.</i>

90
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,625
We've purposely kept
a number of people out of the loop

91
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,662
including Will for fresh eyes.

92
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,497
Are there any questions?

93
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,773
- Sarin gas?
<i>- I don't believe it, either.</i>

94
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,376
I also don't believe in Santa Claus,
but if I saw eight reindeer take flight--

95
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,045
To be clear,
you haven't seen eight reindeer.

96
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,247
You've talked to someone
who says he's seen eight reindeer.

97
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,249
And we have someone
who's tweeted about the reindeer

98
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:20,118
and a third witness who's interviewed
victims of the reindeer

99
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,055
and a highly-placed
confidential source who's confirmed

100
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,424
that in this place at that time,
reindeer flew.

101
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,427
It couldn't matter less,
but Santa Claus has nine reindeer.

102
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,895
- Rudolph.
- Mac, I don't think--

103
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,697
- <i>Dasher, Dancer.</i>
- Vixen, Blitzen.

104
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,598
- How many was that?
- It really doesn't matter.

105
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,000
- You believe we used sarin?
- Yes.

106
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,368
- On civilians?
- Yes.

107
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,103
- Dasher, Dancer, Prancer.
- What are you doing?

108
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,571
Well, I'm digesting
what I just heard.

109
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,273
I'm doing a fact check
on the number of reindeer.

110
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,608
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer,
Comet, Blitzen, Cupid,

111
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,044
Donner, Vixen,
and somebody else.

112
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,212
- Rudolph.
- Thank you.

113
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,580
- Wait, how many was that?
- Start again.

114
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,349
No.
Do we even have sarin gas?

115
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,385
We aren't supposed to.
It was supposed to be destroyed by 2007

116
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,953
according to the Chemical
Weapons Convention.

117
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:57,255
But it wasn't. We still have it.
The DOD confirms that.

118
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,890
We may have it,
but we've never used it.

119
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,193
We didn't use it
in World War II,

120
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,395
Korea, Vietnam,
the first Gulf War,

121
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,263
and we were fighting
people that did have--

122
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,399
Those all happened before 9/11.

123
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,503
We torture people now.
We kidnap them, wire tap them--

124
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,040
- Drop deadly gas on civilians?
- It happened, Jim.

125
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,175
This is the one we know about.

126
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,144
- The original tip came from Cyrus West?
- I know, but--

127
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,547
<i>- He's not reliable.</i>
- His crime was not being good on television.

128
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,950
But he led us to Eric Sweeney,
so who cares?

129
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,418
What about the Marines
who were rescued?

130
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,986
<i>We don't know their names</i>

131
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,621
<i>and they wouldn't have been
in a position to know what happened.</i>

132
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,289
Sweeney says they were in a hole
in back of one of the houses.

133
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,691
And then they were
exposed to the gas.

134
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,359
They would have known
if they were hit with an atropine.

135
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,994
Probably, but it doesn't matter.
We don't know who they are

136
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,329
and we've been looking
for seven months.

137
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,931
We have 30 names
and here they are.

138
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,633
These were given to us
by Sweeney.

139
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,301
<i>None of them is talking
with the exception</i>

140
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,104
<i>of Lance Corporal
Herman Valenzuela who's dead.</i>

141
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,307
It sounded like you said
Herman Valenzuela,

142
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,842
in spite of being dead,
is talking.

143
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,544
- I wasn't saying that.
- I was confused by that, too.

144
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,713
Valenzuela was killed in action,
the other 29 aren't talking.

145
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,415
What about Hamni8?
Have you tried to track him down?

146
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,950
Yes, but he's gone.
We believe given his proximity to the raid

147
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,218
that he was killed.

148
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,888
Well, or that he couldn't
pay for his cell plan.

149
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,589
Those are two
pretty different things.

150
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,591
Have we put boots on the ground
to see if there's any locals we can talk to?

151
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,226
You can't send Americans in there
or anyone working for Americans.

152
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,861
- A local fixer?
<i>- It's much too dangerous.</i>

153
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,430
- What does Tapley say?
<i>- Who?</i>

154
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,365
Mike Tapley,
our military analyst,

155
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,100
who I don't know why
we didn't use him instead of West.

156
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,568
'Cause I was producing
the segment.

157
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,670
Neither Mike nor our Pentagon correspondent
have been brought in.

158
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,172
<i>The Pentagon would go
into shutdown.</i>

159
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,107
We'll ask for comment
24 hours before air.

160
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,343
Before air?

161
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,312
We're really
talking about--

162
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,148
Charlie,
be the voice of reason.

163
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,550
I think it happened

164
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,219
and I think we're two inches away
from proving it.

165
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,655
It's always 50-50 when you ask Charlie
to be the voice of reason.

166
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,657
- Nobody's saying it's ready to air.
- I'm saying it's ready.

167
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,658
It certainly is not.

168
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,626
And we can keep
calling the names

169
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,662
on the list
till St. Swithin's Day,

170
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,631
but we have a better chance of getting
Herman Valenzuela to talk

171
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,400
than any of the other 29.

172
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,802
So we started looking
for someone not on the list.

173
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,305
A flag officer who'd be in a position
to confirm the mission. Neal?

174
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,340
We ran five separate searches
and cross-referenced

175
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,342
the five search parameters
which were the following:

176
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,578
recently retired generals
who have attempted

177
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,513
to publish work that
was heavily redacted,

178
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,014
commanders who have
served as head

179
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,883
of the Marines Combat Logistics
and Munitions Element,

180
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,919
generals who've taken
academic positions since retiring

181
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,822
<i>who've been critical of the US stockpile
of chemical weapons,</i>

182
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,725
and flag officers who were on active duty
when Genoa took place.

183
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,060
When we think Genoa took place.

184
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,263
There's one name that meets
all five criteria.

185
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,867
This is three-star Marine General
Stanislaus Stomtonovich.

186
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,635
<i>He was a munitions
consultant at White Sands</i>

187
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,804
<i>and an expert on the US
chemical weapons program.</i>

188
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,507
He retired six months after Genoa
and lives in Silver Spring.

189
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,409
You're gonna call and ask him
if we dropped sarin gas on a small village?

190
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,378
- No, we're going to his house.
- Charlie, God damn it.

191
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,213
He's already alerted
the Pentagon's Office of Public Affairs.

192
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,748
He thinks we're coming
about something else.

193
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,750
We're just getting
in the vestibule.

194
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,952
But eventually,
you will ask him the question?

195
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,588
Yeah.

196
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,790
Do you understand
what we're accusing them of?

197
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,093
We do, Jim, yeah.
And I think we're less concerned

198
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,729
with what we're accusing them of
than we are with what they did.

199
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,864
What you think they did,
which I still can't hardly believe

200
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,866
my fucking ears
we're even talking about.

201
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,935
- What was the general's name?
- Stomtonovich.

202
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:00,138
How are you gonna question Stomtonovich
without him knowing what you're asking?

203
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,574
We're gonna ask him how chemical weapons
would be stored and deployed.

204
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,043
<i>- What's the cover story?</i>
- Libya.

205
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,615
You've been on this
for seven months?

206
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,519
Do you believe the story?

207
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,622
I don't know.

208
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,925
Have we nailed down
the number of reindeer?

209
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,664
I see you.

210
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,299
You seem really excited
every time this works.

211
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,201
Is it because you're seeing me
or is it because of the technology?

212
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,237
- <i>The technology.</i>
- I get that.

213
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,606
But tomorrow night
it'll be because I'm seeing you.

214
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,008
I'll tell you why you should be excited
about tomorrow night.

215
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,643
I got a suite
at the Soho Grand.

216
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,679
- It cost three years' salary.
- I like you.

217
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,181
- That's such great news for me.
- It really is.

218
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,216
So I'll pick you up
at the event at 10:00.

219
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,085
I'll be out in the lobby.
We'll go to dinner

220
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:50,689
and then back to the hotel for,
you know, discretionary time.

221
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,857
- Speaking of dinner...
- What's about to happen?

222
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,193
- <i>Do you know Aubrey Lerner?</i>
- No.

223
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:57,028
- Her byline is AK.
<i>- I don't know her.</i>

224
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,663
- AK Lerner.
- I don't know her,

225
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,899
but I feel like she's about to be
an obstacle in my path to--

226
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,601
- Discretionary time?
- Yes.

227
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,402
No, she's been
on the press plane

228
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,371
for a couple of weeks
and she reports for mtvU.

229
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,140
It sounds like she'd have a really good time
staying home by herself tomorrow.

230
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,709
I don't think you
should rob her of that.

231
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,577
She stays at her parents' place
when she's in New York

232
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,946
and I thought she could
come out to dinner with us

233
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:16,948
tomorrow night
and you could bring Neal.

234
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,516
<i>I think they'd
really hit it off</i>

235
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,951
and you said he just
broke up with somebody.

236
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,586
Neal's always just
broken up with somebody.

237
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,254
He calls it going home
in the morning.

238
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,756
It'll be a fun foursome.

239
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,192
- Dinner and then straight to the hotel.
- How many of us?

240
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,728
Jim, I'll have just finished covering
a $5,000-a-plate dinner.

241
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,329
I'll be in cocktail attire.

242
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,764
Do it. Do it.

243
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,833
Whatever she's asking to do, do it.
Do it now.

244
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,434
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

245
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,237
- <i>Hey, Gary.</i>
- Hey, Hallie.

246
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,374
In terms of what you're gonna be wearing,
could you describe exactly what--

247
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,409
I'll see you guys
tomorrow at 10:00?

248
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,910
- In the ballroom lobby.
<i>- I've got to go.</i>

249
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,712
I'll talk to you later.

250
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,749
Neal.

251
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,885
Harry Truman dubbed the 80th Congress
the "Do-Nothing Congress."

252
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,920
Its productivity,
measured by this bar,

253
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,822
shows the number of laws
they passed.

254
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,660
The productivity of the 112th Congress
is measured by this bar.

255
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,896
The 112th Congress has not yet
passed 1/6 of the laws

256
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,264
of the Do-Nothing
Congress.

257
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,167
But let's look at the laws
they have passed.

258
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,704
Congressman Peter Roskam
represents the 6th District of Illinois.

259
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,939
<i>Illinois has the fourth
highest unemployment rate</i>

260
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,343
in the country with 9.9%
of its workforce out of work.

261
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,211
So Congressman
Roskam introduced

262
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,447
House Resolution 21-39,

263
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,749
which would require
the Secretary of the Treasury

264
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,651
to mint coins in commemoration

265
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,254
of the centennial
of the Lions Club.

266
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,122
Congressman Randy Forbes
of Virginia

267
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:35,060
sponsored a bill reaffirming
"In God We Trust" as our national motto,

268
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,096
a motto already
made official in 1956,

269
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,033
2002, 2006 and now 2011.

270
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,302
One in four American children
are living in poverty,

271
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,104
but the motto
should take care of that.

272
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,740
<i>We're fighting a war,
a stagnant economy,</i>

273
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,309
a failing education system
and climate change.

274
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:55,880
The 112 Congress
has renamed 40 post offices.

275
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,183
Richard Shelby,
the ranking Republican

276
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,818
on the Senate
Banking Committee,

277
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,654
blocked the appointment
of MIT economist Peter Diamond

278
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,956
to a vacant seat on
the Federal Reserve Board.

279
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,493
Said Shelby, "I do not believe
the current environment of uncertainty

280
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,829
<i>would benefit from
monetary policy decisions</i>

281
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,198
<i>made by board members
who are learning on the job."</i>

282
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,767
<i>While Senator Shelby held up
Peter Diamond's nomination</i>

283
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,570
<i>on the grounds that Diamond
was insufficiently qualified</i>

284
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,472
to counsel
the Federal Reserve Board,

285
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,041
Peter Diamond won
the Nobel Prize for economics.

286
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,111
- You busy?
<i>- No.</i>

287
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:29,614
Hey, this may sound nuts,
but I'm looking at the movie <i>John Carter</i>

288
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,117
- as a possible subject for my <i>News Night</i> segment.
- What about it?

289
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,452
Well, it's about a Civil War
Confederate officer

290
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,955
who's transported to Mars,
which is a lush planet

291
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,790
inhabited by
12-foot-tall barbarians.

292
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,692
Because of his different
bone density

293
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,460
and the planet's low gravity,
John Carter can jump--

294
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,163
I said, "What about it?" not, "What's it about?"
Also, you know, spoilers.

295
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,265
Okay, well, it's projected to lose
about 200 million for Disney.

296
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,033
You want to do
the economics of Hollywood?

297
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,402
Say what you want,
but they're one of the few American industries

298
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,904
still making a product
people want to buy.

299
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,405
Doesn't sound like
they want to buy <i>John Carter</i>.

300
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,508
Well, that's my point.
Nobody's gonna ask for a bailout

301
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,610
and Disney stock
is relatively safe.

302
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,713
Entertainment is one of our highest
revenue-generating exports

303
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,982
and they employ members
of 17 different unions,

304
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,651
all of which have excellent
minimum basic contracts.

305
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,220
They may take it in the teeth on <i>John Carter</i>,
but nobody's gonna get hurt.

306
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,989
It's still early.
It's just a first idea.

307
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,057
- Yeah, no, it sounds good.
- What are you doing?

308
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,859
Looking at last night's show.

309
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,761
- They did a focus group?
- No.

310
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,863
There are dial lines
on the bottom of the screen.

311
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,666
Yeah, those are just--
That's--

312
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,368
What's going on?

313
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,136
I did a focus group.
I did it myself.

314
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,105
<i>I called our company
and did it on my own.</i>

315
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,874
They did the dials
and a moderator got comments after.

316
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,843
- Why?
<i>- Why?</i>

317
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,411
- Yeah.
- To check in.

318
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,979
Why does a politician
take polls?

319
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,881
To find out what people
want him to say the next day.

320
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,216
Are you comfortable
with that analogy?

321
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,919
Charlie doesn't allow me
to be tested anymore.

322
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,021
So I did it myself.

323
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,024
We have kind of a
big brother-little sister relationship.

324
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,859
- Which one are you?
- And the little sister always ends up

325
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,028
chewing out the big brother and he says,
"Thanks, sis."

326
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,963
This is on Nickelodeon?

327
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,966
- Never mind.
- Are you preparing for a chewing out?

328
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,069
Nah.

329
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,238
You forgot to ask me
how the test scores were.

330
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,639
I didn't forget.

331
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,710
427. 427.

332
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:07,812
Are the odd numbers
on the right side or the left side?

333
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,380
I can't see any numbers yet.

334
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,749
All right, you look on the right side,
I'll look on the left side.

335
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,284
I'm already on the left side.

336
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,786
Why don't you look
on the right side?

337
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,688
I'll look on the right side.

338
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,226
Oh.

339
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,168
Hey, found it.

340
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,394
- Is it this house or that house?
- I don't know.

341
00:14:32,417 --> 00:14:35,365
Let's just clean this up
and ring both doorbells.

342
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:38,409
What are you doing
in my garbage cans?

343
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,546
- General Stomtonovich?
- Yeah.

344
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,648
I'm sorry we're a little late.

345
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,250
What are you doing
in my garbage cans?

346
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,185
We ran over them
with our rental car.

347
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,254
We're just gonna
get this cleaned up.

348
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,289
Were you texting?

349
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,992
No, sir.
It was regular negligence.

350
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:56,995
Well, hurry up
and tell me what you want.

351
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,133
I'm sorry, sir.
You're General Stom--

352
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,601
I know who I am.

353
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,304
I'm asking who you are
and how I can help you.

354
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,407
- I'm Charlie Skinner.
- MacKenzie McHale.

355
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,842
Mm-hmm.

356
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,044
How about if I write you
a check for $100

357
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,047
and you send the magazine subscriptions
to whoever you want?

358
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,752
Sir, we spoke to you
on the phone yesterday.

359
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,688
We made an appointment
to see you here at your house.

360
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,124
Yeah, right.

361
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,926
That's too bad.

362
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,361
I like arguing with
Jehovah's Witnesses.

363
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,599
- You want to know how chemical weapons are stored?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

364
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,401
All right.

365
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,170
What is the Marine
Combat Munitions Element?

366
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,706
We oversee all or almost all

367
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,009
of the munitions supplies
for the entirety of the Marine Corps.

368
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,779
- Bullets, bombs...
- And that includes chemical--

369
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,180
Foul him.
Foul him now!

370
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,715
<i>And he buries a three.</i>

371
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,318
Mmm.

372
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,420
March Madness.

373
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,055
Best sporting event on Earth.

374
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,157
Better than the Super Bowl,
World Series--

375
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,359
- Better than the World Cup?
- World Cup?

376
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,994
What are you, from Brazil?

377
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,964
Brooklyn.

378
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,133
2003, Gaddafi announced Libya

379
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,736
would voluntarily
eliminate all materials,

380
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,007
equipment and programs,
but they've still got 'em.

381
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,642
<i>- How about us?</i>
- The US?

382
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,711
- Yeah.
- Do we still have chemical weapons?

383
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:20,878
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

384
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,181
- We do?
- Yeah.

385
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,817
Do you believe chemical weapons are
a legitimate weapon of war?

386
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,286
I believe chemical weapons,
like any other weapons,

387
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,388
are tools to be used
to kill the enemy.

388
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,057
Which tool you use
depends on battlefield circumstance.

389
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,892
- And collateral damage?
- It doesn't make much difference

390
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,129
to the collateral damage
whether it's damage by gas

391
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,697
or a Hellfire missile, does it?

392
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,966
So you think chemical weapons
should be part of our arsenal?

393
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,334
Part of ours, not Libya's.

394
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,270
Do you think we should be able to use
chemical weapons?

395
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,808
Missed free throws
is what kills you.

396
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,748
<i>- General?</i>
- I don't think I want to talk about chemical weapons.

397
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,349
- We think you do.
- Yeah?

398
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,618
During a speech at the War College
two years ago,

399
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,354
you were openly critical
of the destruction of our stockpiles.

400
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,257
<i>You've commissioned two studies
citing the potential need</i>

401
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,192
for chemical weapons
in combat situations

402
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,028
and your book
was so heavily redacted

403
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,396
that all that was left
were pronouns.

404
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,564
Why are you two big shots
in Silver Spring, Maryland,

405
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,035
running into my garbage cans
and asking me about sarin?

406
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,141
General,
we never mentioned sarin.

407
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,077
We know about Genoa.

408
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,288
You can't touch a shooter
while he's in the process of shooting the ball.

409
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,823
It's against the rules.

410
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:41,225
Shooter goes to the foul line,
takes two free throws.

411
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,629
But what happens
if the shooter brandishes a knife?

412
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,230
He's dribbling the ball

413
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,900
and he suddenly takes out
a switchblade.

414
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,868
You're allowed
to grab his arm now

415
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,405
because we're not playing
basketball anymore.

416
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,909
This is a helo manifest.

417
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,644
Can you confirm it's authentic?

418
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,345
It's an authentic
helo manifest.

419
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,114
Can you confirm
that Genoa happened?

420
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,849
Why would I confirm,
even off the record,

421
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,551
the existence
of a classified mission?

422
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,619
Because you believe
very strongly that if the shooter

423
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,824
takes a knife out,
it shouldn't be illegal to grab his arm.

424
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,831
Hmm.

425
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,236
Here are my conditions.
You black out my face.

426
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,871
- Sure.
- Alter my voice.

427
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,806
- Mm-hmm.
- That's it.

428
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,675
We do it right here
noon tomorrow.

429
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,176
I want to be able
to watch the games.

430
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,378
- Not during the interview.
- I'm not turning that TV off.

431
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,882
I don't know how many years
I have left after this thing goes on the air.

432
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,285
The producer's name
is Jerry Dantana.

433
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,455
He's from the DC bureau
and it's been his story from the beginning.

434
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,225
We have to head back to New York,
General.

435
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,193
It was nice meeting you.

436
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,729
<i>We won't have any more communication
after this unless it's necessary.</i>

437
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,798
How did he find it--
Dantana?

438
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,900
<i>How did he find the story?</i>

439
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,802
Just a lucky tip.

440
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,071
And then very late
in my political career,

441
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,107
I had the opportunity to read the speech
and I almost threw up.

442
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,377
The speech that almost made
Senator Santorum vomit

443
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,148
was given by John F. Kennedy
in Houston, Texas, in 1960.

444
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,617
The presidential candidate
was answering concerns

445
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,686
that his Catholicism would be
his compass in the Oval Office.

446
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:18,222
And the Houston speech
made a forceful argument

447
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:22,093
for a firewall between religion,
any religion, and government.

448
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,929
With us by satellite from Boulder, Colorado,
is Randall Dell,

449
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:28,166
President of the League of Catholic Voters
and a Santorum supporter.

450
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,468
- Mr. Dell, welcome.
- Good to be here.

451
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,770
The common wisdom is that
political candidates

452
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,640
- shouldn't be asked about their religious beliefs.
<i>- I agree with that.</i>

453
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,776
But what if a candidate makes their religious
beliefs part of their candidacy?

454
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,678
<i>Is there a candidate
who's doing that?</i>

455
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,780
- The candidate you support is doing that.
- That's not true, sir.

456
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,582
Is Rick Santorum devout?
Yes.

457
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,317
Does his faith guide his actions?
Yes.

458
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,953
Does he say so every day
in campaign speeches? He does.

459
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,421
Let's put this quote
up on the screen.

460
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:51,856
- G17-A.
<i>- Got it.</i>

461
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,791
<i>Rick Santorum speaking
at a Tea Party event in Columbus.</i>

462
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:57,261
He said this in regard
to President Obama's climate change agenda.

463
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,298
"It's not about your quality of life.
It's not about your jobs.

464
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,668
It's about some phony ideal.
Some phony theology.

465
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,171
Oh, not a theology based on the Bible.
A different theology."

466
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,507
Mr. Dell, one of
Rick Santorum's problems

467
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,742
with the president's plan
to combat climate change

468
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,611
is that its roots
can't be found in the Bible.

469
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,247
We have a lot of reasons to be
concerned with Obama's plans,

470
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,282
but you're plainly distorting
Rick Santorum's words.

471
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,251
<i>I don't think I am,
but let's go to this instead.</i>

472
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,619
<i>- 17B.</i>
- Up.

473
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,054
- 30 seconds.
- Let it go long.

474
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,288
...at the Press
and People of Faith

475
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,224
<i>in Politics forum in 2008.</i>

476
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:29,060
<i>"I think there are a lot of problems with
the theory of evolution</i>

477
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,761
<i>and I do believe
it is used to promote</i>

478
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,598
<i>a world view that is anti-theist,
that is atheist.</i>

479
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,667
You should have academic freedom
in the classroom when teaching about life."

480
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,303
- <i>That was 2008. Mr. Santorum...</i>
- Ready 18.

481
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,871
...made those remarks
when he didn't hold office.

482
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,373
- He was speaking as a private citizen.
- Ready.

483
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,609
<i>- Go.</i>
- He was speaking in defense of an amendment

484
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,245
he offered in 2001
when he was a US Senator,

485
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,615
making it a federal law that,
"Where topics are taught

486
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,618
that may generate controversy,
such as biological evolution,

487
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,720
the curriculum should help
students to understand

488
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,522
the full range
of scientific views that exist."

489
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,157
By full range
of scientific views,

490
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,326
- he's including Genesis, right?
- That's right.

491
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,262
It seems like far from
objecting that religion

492
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,031
be brought up in political campaigns,
he's insisting on it.

493
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,433
And here's Rick Santorum's opponent,
Mitt Romney,

494
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,469
- <i>asking us not to ask about his religion.</i>
- 22.

495
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,071
That idea that we should
choose people

496
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,907
based upon their religion
for public office

497
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,143
is what I find
to be most troubling,

498
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,812
because the founders
of this country went to great length

499
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,815
to make sure,
and even put it in the Constitution,

500
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,251
that we would not choose people
who represent us

501
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,853
in government
based upon their religion.

502
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,389
And now here he is
invoking his religion.

503
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,624
The Declaration of Independence
established our rights

504
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,593
by saying that
they were created

505
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,595
not by government,
but by the Creator.

506
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,931
We are endowed by our Creator
with certain unalienable rights.

507
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,667
I will fight to preserve
America's tradition...

508
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,335
<i>...as a religious nation.</i>

509
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,370
So, can we really not ask
these candidates questions

510
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,740
- <i>about what they believe with regard to religion?</i>
- Well, like what?

511
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:53,477
Like is it important that you and I
have the same definition of "creator"?

512
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,979
They plainly meant God.

513
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,781
That's not plain to everybody.

514
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,217
Like right there.
Just a smile would have made it folksier.

515
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,720
Also, honey,
you've got to stay away from religion.

516
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,088
You know you're
just asking for it.

517
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,523
What else am I supposed
to talk about

518
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,525
with the President
of the League of Catholic Voters?

519
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,894
You don't have him on as a guest.
That's another thing.

520
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,496
You want guests that don't
make you look so combative.

521
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,398
That's why your likability
numbers are down.

522
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,567
- I don't know. I think I'm likable.
- I think you're lovable.

523
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,136
- Thank you.
- But your numbers are problematic.

524
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:23,541
Listen to me,
I'd like dinner to last

525
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,209
10 to 15 minutes.

526
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,711
You don't like to linger.

527
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,679
I'm doing my lingering
somewhere else tonight,

528
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,282
so we're not ordering anything
that takes a long time to prepare.

529
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,450
We're not ordering
anything well-done.

530
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,751
We're not ordering
anything cooked.

531
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,753
It's okay with me
if we don't order anything.

532
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:38,055
- It's not going to be okay with the restaurant.
- Screw the restaurant, Neal.

533
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,725
The restaurant hasn't
not seen his girlfriend in a month.

534
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,362
The restaurant's girlfriend
isn't wearing cocktail attire.

535
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,664
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

536
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,767
Six minutes and 20 seconds.

537
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,202
God, it's you.

538
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,838
That's how long you spent tonight
on Etch-a-Sketch.

539
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,607
- Six minutes and 20 seconds.
- Hey, Taylor.

540
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,476
- Hi, Jim.
- You look very nice.

541
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,045
- Thank you.
- This is Neal Sampat. We work together.

542
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,247
Neal, this is Taylor Warren,
a Romney campaign spokesman.

543
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,583
- Woman-- Uh, spokesperson.
- Nice to meet you.

544
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,685
- <i>You work for ACN?</i>
- Yes.

545
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,421
I loathe you in ways
that are unquantifiable.

546
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,956
Cool.

547
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,558
- You must be excited to see Hallie.
- I am.

548
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,695
I mentioned to Hallie that I didn't
have anything to do in the city tonight.

549
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,931
- No.
- And she said that I should join you guys for dinner.

550
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,102
You should see the look on your face.

551
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,438
Don't worry,
I know you had a special night planned,

552
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:29,306
so of course I'm coming along.
You know why?

553
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,909
- Because we spent six minutes and 20 seconds--
- On Etch-a-Sketch, yeah.

554
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,645
- It was a story and you know it.
- No, it was a gaffe.

555
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,415
He came out and said,
"Don't worry about anything I've said during the primary.

556
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,916
I can be whatever
you want me to be."

557
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,384
He didn't say it.
Fehrnstrom did.

558
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,886
And how do you
expect us to juggle

559
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,688
<i>very diverse coalitions
inside the Republican party?</i>

560
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,491
- Really glad I came tonight.
- There's no way you're coming to dinner.

561
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,427
Jim.

562
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,665
- I've missed you.
- You look amazing.

563
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,233
- Plus?
- I've missed you, too.

564
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,935
There it is.
This is Aubrey.

565
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,637
Hey, it's nice to meet you.
Neal.

566
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:02,540
Okay, full disclosure--
The press wasn't allowed any food,

567
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,375
but we stole a couple
bottles of Chardonnay

568
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,644
- and I am wicked hammered.
- Okay.

569
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,947
- Neal, this is Aubrey.
- Hey.

570
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,249
- Nice to meet you.
- Full disclosure-- The press wasn't allowed any food,

571
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,784
but we stole a couple
bottles of Chardonnay--

572
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,786
- Wicked hammered.
- You said that already.

573
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,488
We're gonna get some food
in your stomach.

574
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,490
Maybe that's not necessary.

575
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,360
So, listen,
Taylor's kind of sad tonight.

576
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,496
I don't know why,
so I asked her to come to dinner.

577
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,264
She's not sad.
She's mad 'cause we did

578
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,099
six minutes and 20 seconds
on Etch-a-Sketch.

579
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,269
And now I have to have a dinner with her
that could last up to a half hour.

580
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,938
You're afraid of Taylor.

581
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,340
Being afraid of Taylor
is just good common sense.

582
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,075
- Anybody hungry?
- I can boot and rally.

583
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,643
Let's do it.

584
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,879
- You here alone?
- Yeah. You?

585
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,581
I am.

586
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,815
This is what I do now.

587
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,851
I drink alone at bars
late at night.

588
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,553
See, men can do that
with no stigma attached.

589
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:50,621
- Women--
- Women can vote

590
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,556
and your vote counts
the same as my vote.

591
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,559
I'm really supposed
to worry about a stigma?

592
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,061
Oh, Don.

593
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,330
Don, Don.

594
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,065
Don.

595
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,834
Are you happy with that name?

596
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,203
Pretty happy.
Never really thought about it.

597
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,872
How'd it go in Maryland?

598
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,907
He confirmed.

599
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,911
Will he do it on camera?

600
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,679
- Find out tomorrow.
- Hey, Mac.

601
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,648
- What do you say, Chelsea?
- You here alone?

602
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,650
- Don't stigmatize her.
- Where's the gang?

603
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,385
Jim and Neal
are on a double date,

604
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,387
Sloan is out
with a New York Giant,

605
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:27,791
and Will's having a quiet night at home
with Mrs. Macbeth.

606
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,326
He took some questions
from the audience

607
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,195
and somebody asked him
if he thought the court

608
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,763
was going to overturn the ACA.

609
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,698
And I thought he was
gonna duck the question,

610
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,267
but he answered
for about two minutes.

611
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,402
- What did he say?
- I swear to God, I don't know.

612
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,104
Can I ask something?

613
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,439
What's the fucking obsession
with Ann Romney's horse?

614
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:44,975
- Reagan had a horse.
- His horse didn't dance.

615
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,211
So fucking what, James?
It's a clever horse.

616
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,846
It's an Olympian.
It's a horse.

617
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,281
And what in this is bad?

618
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:52,483
And how do you know
that Reagan's horse didn't dance?

619
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,151
It's a reasonable question,
James.

620
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:55,953
How did you get
into campaign reporting?

621
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,255
I told my bosses that nobody
was covering Ron Paul

622
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,790
and they were like,
"Go do it yourself."

623
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,825
And I was like, "Really?"
And they were like, "Really."

624
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,561
So Ron Paul, 2012!

625
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,962
- Is this your--
- Whoo-hoo!

626
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,197
- Okay.
- Seriously?

627
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,166
Yeah, she's into it.

628
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,672
- Hey.
- Hi.

629
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,540
- You're back again.
- Yeah.

630
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,009
- It was Stoli and tonic?
- Yeah.

631
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,911
- I'm Devon.
- Maggie.

632
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,916
<i>I admire MacKenzie.</i>

633
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,918
- And Charlie.
- So do I.

634
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,620
I know you do.

635
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,389
But I wonder if it's blinding you
to certain things.

636
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,358
Like what?

637
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:38,095
Well, honey, every night
you cross examine somebody.

638
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,264
They're using your
prosecutorial skills.

639
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:43,834
Wait. First, they're not my puppet masters.
I'm the managing editor.

640
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,469
But don't you always
listen to MacKenzie?

641
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,504
- Not always.
- What percent of the time?

642
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,239
I don't know.
But the idea is

643
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,141
that we cross examine people
from time to time.

644
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,711
- We?
- A lot of staff prep goes into those segments.

645
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,546
But the staff's face
isn't on camera.

646
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,482
What are we talking about?

647
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,885
Are you being sacrificed
so that Mac and Charlie

648
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,721
can do the show
they want to do?

649
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,389
It's the show
I want to do, too.

650
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,391
- Is it?
- Yeah.

651
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,526
Then that's that.
If it's the show you want to do,

652
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,296
then who cares how many people like you?
I like you.

653
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:17,368
It actually doesn't measure
how many people like you.

654
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,003
It measures how much
people like you.

655
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,537
- How much?
- Yeah.

656
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:22,106
That's not something
that can be measured.

657
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,741
That's right.

658
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,543
So this is really
all there is to go on?

659
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,249
Do you fully trust
Jerry Dantana?

660
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:34,985
- Why wouldn't I?
- No reason. I was just curious.

661
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,721
- But there's a reason you're asking.
- There really isn't.

662
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,090
- Can I tell you what it is?
- It was just curiosity.

663
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,992
- It's 'cause he's not Jim.
- Please.

664
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,995
Jerry has committed the crime of
not being Jim Harper.

665
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,797
You know how long
it took you to trust me?

666
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,566
- How long?
- I'll let you know when it happens.

667
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,036
I completely trust you.

668
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,972
- Do you?
- With my life, Don.

669
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,907
Thank you.
That's nice to hear.

670
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,143
You know,
when I look at you--

671
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,513
- Sloan's going out with a football player?
- Yeah.

672
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,314
- Who?
- I don't remember his name.

673
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,949
- You know what position he plays?
- No.

674
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,418
- Offense or defense?
- I don't know.

675
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,919
Why don't you just ask her out?

676
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,554
After she's gone out
with a professional athlete

677
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,590
who's 10 years younger
than I am with 3% body fat

678
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,259
and ripped muscles
that have been conditioned

679
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,695
over a lifetime
of two-a-days sweating--

680
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,596
How long have you been
thinking about this guy?

681
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,165
How am I supposed
to follow that?

682
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,967
- And, you know...
- Get it done?

683
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,103
I can get it done.

684
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,505
I'm saying...

685
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,275
get it done in
a spectacular fashion.

686
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,645
This is how most men think?

687
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,213
This is how every
single man thinks

688
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,182
except for the guy
out with Sloan right now.

689
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,018
And that's why you
haven't asked her out?

690
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,220
Sometimes she subs in
for Elliott

691
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,355
and sometimes she does
a segment with us,

692
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,924
which means sometimes
I'm her boss.

693
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,827
That stopped absolutely no one here,
including you and Maggie.

694
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,429
That worked out
phenomenally well.

695
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,225
Nothing that happened to her
is your fault.

696
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,608
That's the spicy
Shanghai soup noodles,

697
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,478
- <i>chilled silken tofu garlic and herbs?</i>
<i>- Yes, it is.</i>

698
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,379
- How'd you recognize that?
- It's kind of a hobby.

699
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,315
And here's the charred
chili rubbed beef skewer.

700
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,083
- With Thai basil dipping sauce.
- That's right.

701
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,551
<i>- So, Jim.</i>
- Yeah?

702
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,153
- I have to tell you something.
- Okay.

703
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,889
The <i>Sex and the City</i> story
is off-the-charts awesome.

704
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,258
- What's the <i>Sex and the City</i> story?
- Please, no.

705
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,694
Is it an embarrassing
story about Jim?

706
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,863
It's not embarrassing.
It's sweet.

707
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,364
I'd like to hear it
as many times

708
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,467
as ACN's run the "I like to fire people"
sound bite.

709
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,870
- Everybody ran it, Taylor.
- And everybody, including you,

710
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,538
knew what he meant
when he said it.

711
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,373
Let's play the game
where we identify the food.

712
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,942
- What's this?
- You're pointing at rice.

713
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,511
I believe that's correct.

714
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,179
You know,
I could tell the story...

715
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,782
- Yep.
- ...or we can watch it on YouTube.

716
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,850
Oh, sweet.

717
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,886
I'm starting to feel
responsible for this.

718
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,855
What about <i>ACN Morning</i>?

719
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,591
- You think I should go on?
- I think you should start there.

720
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,960
I think you need
to warm yourself up

721
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,762
<i>and a morning show
is a great place to start.</i>

722
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,564
Just go on and do some jokes?

723
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,734
Just be you.
Nebraska farm boy.

724
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,270
The guy who knows
how to build his own cabin.

725
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,138
I don't know how
to build my own cabin.

726
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,241
Well, you seem like you do.
You need to seem like you do.

727
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,343
Midwestern.
You used to steal

728
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,046
your mother's pies
when she put them out to cool.

729
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,314
You're confusing me
with a hobo.

730
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,449
- You know what I'm saying.
<i>- I think I do.</i>

731
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,418
- Then do it.
- Okay.

732
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,420
- How about tomorrow morning?
- Well, it's after midnight.

733
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,924
ACN is a network
built around one person.

734
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:30,360
You call the EP,
tell him you're coming on in the morning.

735
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,530
You'll feel better
once you start to turn this around.

736
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:36,433
- I will feel better.
- 75s become 85s fast,

737
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:39,069
but they become 55s faster.

738
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,841
All right.

739
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,679
That gentleman over there
would like to buy this for you.

740
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,520
This is nice of you,
but I have to tell you

741
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,222
I'm just hanging out
alone tonight.

742
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,324
<i>- That's okay.</i>
- It's nothing personal.

743
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,558
The drink's on me anyway.

744
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,228
Very kind.
Thank you.

745
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,930
- I'm just thinking my thoughts.
<i>- Understood.</i>

746
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,437
<i>I have a number of questions.</i>

747
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,572
I'll try to answer them
with the same detail

748
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,241
and honesty you've
always answered mine.

749
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,977
What were you doing on a <i>Sex and the City</i>
tour bus to begin with?

750
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,812
My girlfriend at the time
liked the show

751
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,714
and I was showing an interest
in her interests.

752
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,716
And Maggie didn't know you were on the bus
when she shouted that she loved you?

753
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,284
That's not what she shouted.

754
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,785
- And she didn't know someone was filming it?
- No.

755
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,621
- So it was kind of a gaffe?
- Lady, I--

756
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,523
Life and death and you guys can't get past
corporations are people.

757
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,459
How fast are we
supposed to get past

758
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,793
"Hispanics
should self-deport"

759
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,428
or "I'm not concerned
with the very poor"?

760
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,431
"There's a safety net there"
was the end of that sentence,

761
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,867
and plainly his concern
is with the middle class.

762
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,369
The middle class
are the very poor.

763
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,705
The better point is we don't need clean air
and water regulations.

764
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,675
We don't need FEMA.
We don't need antitrust laws.

765
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,579
We don't need the IRS or the Department
of Education or the Federal Reserve.

766
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,048
We need freedom.

767
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,918
What the fuck did you just say?

768
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,920
If you listen
to Ron Paul--

769
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,122
I have.
He's a batty old crank

770
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,392
who wrote instruction manuals on
how to get away with shooting the black kid

771
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,227
who's stealing your car.
He's not Betty White.

772
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,828
- He didn't write those letters.
- Yes, he did.

773
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,131
And then he signed them
and then he charged money for them.

774
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,800
So I don't give a shit
if he wants to legalize weed.

775
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,669
I can already dial the phone
and have an ounce

776
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,304
delivered to this table
before the check comes.

777
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,439
- Then for God's sake, do it.
- The check will never come.

778
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:24,074
They won't let Romney
get his message out, either.

779
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,276
Someone should tell him
if he wants to get his message out,

780
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,079
he should consider
appearing on a network

781
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,882
where the entire audience
isn't already voting for him

782
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,850
and that if he's gonna be
the businessman president,

783
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,120
he should run on his business record
instead of pretending he's never heard of it

784
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:40,223
and that if faith is important
to his good works and personal narrative,

785
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,925
he shouldn't be afraid
it'll creep us out.

786
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,427
- It's been suggested.
- And?

787
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:45,295
I was fired.

788
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,933
- I was fired tonight.
- You were fired?

789
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,768
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- For suggesting--

790
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,905
No, I suggested
other things, too.

791
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,642
I'm sorry.

792
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,178
You were a good
spokesperson for him.

793
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,515
You should go work
for Ron Paul.

794
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,251
We need to rebound from dinner.

795
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,786
- Yeah.
- Bounce back.

796
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,822
- I've already bounced.
- It's just us now.

797
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,057
With a little over six hours.

798
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,961
This is...

799
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,902
Maggie?

800
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,871
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

801
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,041
I'm just having a drink
with a friend of mine from college.

802
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,710
What are you doing here?

803
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,847
Jim's fixing my computer.
I'm staying here.

804
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:40,217
This is Hallie Shea.
Hallie, this is Maggie Jordan.

805
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,685
- Hi.
- It's nice to meet you.

806
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,286
You, too.

807
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,888
Well, we should, um--

808
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,657
- I have to be on the press plane pretty early.
- Yeah.

809
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,361
- Good meeting you.
- You, too.

810
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:53,163
See you later.

811
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,536
- That was nice of you.
- I doubt it mattered.

812
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:09,446
Wow.

813
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,415
Is there something
wrong with the room?

814
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,927
I am not unskilled
in the ways of courtship.

815
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:27,531
I know, babe, but still,
just saying that...

816
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,138
I am pouring you some champagne

817
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,407
and then taking a hot shower.

818
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:40,477
Can I offer you
a Toblerone from the minibar?

819
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,947
- Honey.
- What is it?

820
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,682
<i>They just added on an event</i>

821
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,051
at a base in Colorado
for the morning.

822
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,653
For tomorrow morning?

823
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,822
I have to be on a plane
in 90 minutes.

824
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,091
<i>Are you religious?</i>

825
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,126
In my way.

826
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,228
Me, too.

827
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,363
I think the way you know
you've broken one of God's rules

828
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:03,266
is if you can't put it
back together again.

829
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,103
You kidnap an entire people,

830
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,572
make them slaves--
It's 300 years later

831
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,273
and we can't put it
back together again.

832
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,908
You and Will?

833
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,710
Doesn't really seem
like the same scale.

834
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,213
- As slavery?
- Yeah.

835
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,515
No.

836
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,717
But here we are.

837
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:22,219
You should go out.

838
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,720
I do.

839
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,188
You'll meet someone.

840
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,761
You're sure you trust Jerry?

841
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,563
I have no reason not to.

842
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,635
Mac, if Charlie green lights it

843
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,104
and Will and the lawyers...

844
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,275
you still have to consider
not running it.

845
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,910
- I know.
- The size of this...

846
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,045
- I've thought about the risk.
- Embassies will be attacked.

847
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,447
- POWs will--
- There'll be protests.

848
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,182
Protests in some countries
look a lot like riots.

849
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,617
Muslims will go crazy.

850
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,585
I was at <i>Newsweek</i> in 2005.

851
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,658
For the guy who flushed
a Koran down the toilet?

852
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,360
Yeah.
We report the story

853
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,395
and two months later,
the London subway blows up.

854
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,497
- It's not clear the two were connected.
- The bomber's cousin said--

855
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,734
- Somebody was gonna report it.
- Ah, maybe not.

856
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,372
Maybe not.

857
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:19,176
Anyway, I hope you're
considering cause and effect,

858
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,977
'cause if we broke
one of God's rules,

859
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,180
it might be best
just to shut up about it.

860
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,092
Where's your friend?

861
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,729
She took off.
I'm just paying the check.

862
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,632
Did you fix her computer?

863
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,335
No, I wasn't really able to.

864
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,471
Because you don't know shit
about fixing computers?

865
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,281
This thing we've
been talking about,

866
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,584
- Jerry's thing...
- Yeah?

867
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,388
Secrecy is
incredibly important.

868
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,593
I've been working on it
for seven months

869
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,761
and you didn't hear about it,
right?

870
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,864
- Yeah.
- Okay.

871
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,533
Just be careful
when you're drinking.

872
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,005
I will.

873
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,809
- Hey, you ready to go?
- Yeah.

874
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,946
I think you're supposed
to be paying the check.

875
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,781
She's all covered.

876
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,689
<i>- And you were a high school athlete.</i>
- That's right.

877
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,825
<i>There's another thing
we didn't know about you.</i>

878
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,194
Baseball and football.
Pitcher and quarterback.

879
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:46,796
- It was a small school.
- The question is were you any good?

880
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,634
- I wasn't bad.
- Well, we're gonna find out right now.

881
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,703
- Uh-oh.
- We're gonna have you stand on this line

882
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,705
- and make five throws.
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

883
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,642
Every throw that goes
through the tire is $1,000

884
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:00,543
to the Sloan-Kettering
Memorial Cancer Research Center.

885
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:01,945
It seems like cancer research

886
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,813
shouldn't have to depend
on my throwing accuracy.

887
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,049
- Come on now, don't chicken out, McAvoy.
- All right.

888
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,219
Wait, there's one more
piece of apparatus.

889
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,087
I don't think
I'm gonna need a helmet,

890
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,756
- unless you guys plan on--
- Oh, it's just for fun.

891
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,658
<i>It's a morning show.
We have fun here.</i>

892
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,726
- Yeah, all right.
- There it is.

893
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,395
All right,
this is for cancer research.

894
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,196
On the line.

895
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,798
On your mark.
Get--

896
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:31,007
I know you think it went badly,
but it didn't.

897
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,177
I have to do two things--
I have to write a huge check to Sloan-Kettering

898
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,379
and then I absolutely
have to break up with you.

899
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,848
They're both important.
I get why the first one has to come first,

900
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:42,218
but the second one has to come right after,
no delay.

901
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:45,989
Why didn't you just say
I shouldn't worry about the number?

902
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,624
Because you should.

903
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,993
I was aiming for
the fucking light tree.

904
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,266
You didn't care that
you scored in the high 90s

905
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,235
<i>in trust and intelligence?</i>

906
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,272
- You looked like Dukakis riding in the tank.
- I know.

907
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,108
I've done a comprehensive study on
your psychological profile.

908
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,644
<i>Introduction to First Year
Adult Psychology</i>.

909
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,980
I haven't read the whole thing,
but I read from page eight to--

910
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,083
Well, I've read
most of page eight.

911
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,818
And here's
what happened to you.

912
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,619
<i>A long, long time ago,</i>

913
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,288
<i>you were doing a show you liked
with MacKenzie.</i>

914
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:20,690
<i>Then she broke your heart.
Then you started doing a different show.</i>

915
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,827
A softer show.
A show built around your likeable personality.

916
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,363
And the love you got
from the audience filled, almost,

917
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,897
the hole in your heart.

918
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,833
<i>You're happy
from 8:00 to 9:00</i>

919
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,801
<i>and miserable
the other 23 hours.</i>

920
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,404
<i>You feel more comfortable
with strangers than with friends.</i>

921
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,439
Then suddenly
Mackie's back in town

922
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,042
and she's making you do
the show you're supposed to be doing

923
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,277
and she insists
that you and everyone else

924
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,846
do the news, and you like that.

925
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,714
But that does mean
you might lose

926
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,916
some of your invisible friends.
That sound about right?

927
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,919
- I don't believe it really said that in the book.
<i>- I extrapolated.</i>

928
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,889
You gonna tell me I'm supposed to love myself
before anyone else can love me?

929
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,125
- Mm-hmm.
- "Self-love, my liege,

930
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,560
is not so vile a sin
as self-neglecting."

931
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,596
I read page eight
of Shakespeare, too.

932
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,166
"A woman is like a tea bag. You can't tell
how strong she is until you put her in hot water."

933
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,934
- <i>Who said that?</i>
- Eleanor Roosevelt.

934
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,436
- Does that have anything to do with this?
- No.

935
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,038
Okay.

936
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,541
That's it?
I thought I was getting chewed out.

937
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,410
I can't say anything that would make you feel
worse than you do right now.

938
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,812
- I like that you know that.
- You know what a Goldilocks planet is?

939
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,381
It's a planet
with the potential to support life

940
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,283
because of its
proximity to a star.

941
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,551
- Not too hot, not too cold.
- Right.

942
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,520
<i>Near liquid water,
but not made of liquid water.</i>

943
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,188
Enough oxygen,
but not too much nitrogen.

944
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:27,524
And we use something, um...

945
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:29,893
- Transit spectroscopy.
- I think that's what it's called.

946
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,128
To analyze the atmosphere
and find planets

947
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,997
<i>that match the different
requirements.</i>

948
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:37,066
<i>1,300 planets were identified,
but only two confirmed.</i>

949
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,802
And of those two,

950
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:41,337
one turned out to be...
something.

951
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:43,006
- Radioactive.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

952
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,542
So right now
that leaves one planet

953
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:49,212
in all of space that's perfect.

954
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,281
You're talking about
what I think you're talking about, right?

955
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:52,882
- I probably am.
- All right.

956
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,050
Okay.

957
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,819
How'd the date with
the Giant go last night?

958
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,054
Not that good.
He ditched me around midnight.

959
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,690
But I did end up dancing
with Savannah Guthrie for a while.

960
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,927
That girl can dance.
Have you seen the sheer length of her legs?

961
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:07,530
I embarrassed the whole team
this morning and I'm sorry.

962
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,399
It won't happen again.

963
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,835
I love you, Will.

964
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,404
Thanks, sis.

965
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,977
- You look tired.
<i>- I'm not.</i>

966
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,912
- When'd you get in?
- On the first shuttle.

967
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,848
What are we going to do
about the screen?

968
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,883
Oh, it has to be on.
It's a condition.

969
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,486
I can't frame it out.
There's gonna be a piece of the game in the shot.

970
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,054
We're gonna blur it out.

971
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,956
Why not just move the chair?

972
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,191
I want the hardware
for gravitas.

973
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,727
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

974
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,029
- General.
- Let me just see what's going on here.

975
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,437
It's a good game.

976
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,040
- Jerry Dantana?
- Yes, sir.

977
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,443
This is Maggie Jordan.
She's also a producer on the story.

978
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:54,944
She'll be leaving
before we start.

979
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,446
No, she's a producer
on the story.

980
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,582
- She understands--
- I was told Jerry Dantana.

981
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,117
Sir--

982
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:04,387
Charlie Skinner and MacKenzie McHale
told me Jerry Dantana,

983
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,857
and Jerry Dantana
is who I had investigated,

984
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,826
not Maggie Jordan.

985
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,895
- Um--
- It's all right. I'll wait outside.

986
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,864
Just check your levels
once in a while.

987
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:16,633
Fellas, you all set?

988
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,135
- Yeah.
- Okay, could you wait outside?

989
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,240
- Mmm.
- You can sit right there, sir.

990
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,711
You understand we're going
to ask about Operation Genoa

991
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,813
- and that it was a classified mission?
- Yes.

992
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:34,083
Okay, you're all set.

993
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,785
I'm stepping out.

994
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:40,323
<i>- And you're going to confirm it happened.</i>
<i>- It happened.</i>

995
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,263
<i>What was Operation Genoa?</i>

996
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,932
An extraction.

997
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,633
Two Marines were taken
by the enemy

998
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,569
and I won't say more than that.

999
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,404
Who carried out the extraction?

1000
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,973
MARSOC--
Marines Special Operations Command.

1001
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,475
Were any exceptional measures
used in the operation?

1002
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,744
Exceptional measures
were called for.

1003
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,413
Were they used?

1004
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:10,720
General?

1005
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,560
- Was sarin gas used during Genoa?
<i>- It is right.</i>

1006
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,897
It is moral and necessary to use
any means in that situation,

1007
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,333
in the situation they were in,
to use the means

1008
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,568
at your disposal to rescue
captured prisoners.

1009
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,504
- Did we use sarin gas?
- If we used sarin-- Let me put it this way.

1010
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,707
- Sir.
- Here's how we would have used sarin.

1011
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,241
I'd like the logistics
in a moment,

1012
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,411
but right now I'm asking you
if we used sarin gas.

1013
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,947
<i>If</i> we used sarin--

1014
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,682
- General--
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

1015
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:44,454
If we used sarin,
here's how we used sarin.

1016
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,324
It would have been stockpiled
in a depot in Okinawa.

1017
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,293
<i>That's first.
It was guarded...</i>

1018
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,601
Two Marines...

1019
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,904
<i>- ...we used sarin gas?</i>
- If <i>we used sarin--</i>

1020
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,806
- <i>General--</i>
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

1021
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:08,444
If we used sarin,
here's how we used sarin.

1022
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:14,651
If we used sarin,
here's how we used sarin.

1023
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,186
<i>...how we used sarin.</i>

1024
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,489
<i>...how we used sarin.</i>

1025
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,259
...we used sarin.

1026
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,432
<i>It is right.
It is moral and necess--</i>

1027
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,670
<i>It is moral and--</i>

1028
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,538
<i>Who carried out the extraction?</i>

1029
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:38,274
MARSOC-- Marines Special
Operations Command.

1030
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,276
<i>Did we use sarin gas?</i>

1031
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,211
We used sarin.

1032
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:43,680
<i>And how is that used?</i>

1033
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:47,417
<i>Here's how we used sarin.</i>

1034
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,185
<i>It would have been
stockpiled...</i>

1035
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:52,255
- I want to see the raw footage.
- Yeah.

1036
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,498
Here we go.

1037
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,968
<i>Were any exceptional
measures used in the operation?</i>

1038
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:07,904
Exceptional measures
were called for.

1039
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,739
<i>Like what?</i>

1040
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,743
We used sarin.

1041
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:17,146
It is right.
It is moral and necessar--

1042
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,784
We're not there yet.

1043
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:25,955
- You're joking, right?
<i>- It's compelling film.</i>

1044
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,424
- Compelling?
- When Mac and I showed up at his house yesterday,

1045
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,693
he'd forgotten he'd talked
to us on the phone.

1046
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,329
He thought we were selling
magazine subscriptions.

1047
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,398
He wasn't being asked about--

1048
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,500
Did it seem to you like
he was shaky during--

1049
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,068
I want another witness.

1050
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,970
- We have our key witness.
- He wasn't there.

1051
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,505
- He knew about it.
- Didn't remember we'd called.

1052
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,240
- He didn't remember at first, right?
- Jerry--

1053
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,908
We've got evidence
of a war crime.

1054
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,844
<i>Just sit with that
for a second.</i>

1055
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:52,281
We dropped sarin gas
on a village.

1056
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,818
We have a moral imperative
to question

1057
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,488
the flagrant disregard
with which the president

1058
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,156
<i>and the national security
establishment</i>

1059
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,625
treat the Constitution
and international laws.

1060
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,193
What does this have to do
with the Constitution?

1061
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,596
We've killed four American citizens
without due process.

1062
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,131
And those are the ones
we know about.

1063
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,932
Five times as many
drone strikes

1064
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,201
as the entire Bush presidency.

1065
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,403
Dramatically increased
wire tapping,

1066
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,205
detentions,
prosecuting whistle blowers,

1067
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,775
several of whom
are willing to go on camera for us.

1068
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,877
- What your problem is...
- Careful, Jerry.

1069
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,379
...is that you like him.
You like this president.

1070
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,782
You trust him.
Go ahead, we trust you.

1071
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:29,118
<i>Chase Nielsen flew
the Doolittle Raid after Pearl Harbor</i>

1072
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,120
and got water boarded
by the Japanese,

1073
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,756
and we executed
the Japanese soldiers who did it!

1074
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,892
What the fuck is going on?!

1075
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,727
We have it.

1076
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,564
How long before
you're comfortable?

1077
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,301
Former Pennsylvania Senator
Rick Santorum

1078
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:47,003
suspended his campaign
for the presidency...

1079
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,505
President Obama told ABC News
Robin Roberts

1080
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,707
that same-sex couples
should be able to get married.

1081
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,776
Texas Representative
Ron Paul said today

1082
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,813
that he will stop actively campaigning
in the Republican primaries.

1083
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,614
And now,
thanks to the Lone Star State,

1084
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,017
Governor Romney can officially drop
the word "presumptive."

1085
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,352
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker
is still the governor...

1086
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,154
Chick-Fil-A's president,
Dan Cathy said,

1087
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,490
"I think we are inviting
God's judgment on our nation."

1088
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:09,625
The White House is exercising
executive privilege

1089
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,295
over documents requested by
the House Oversight Committee

1090
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,330
in its investigation
of <i>Fast and Furious</i>.

1091
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,532
Chief Justice John Roberts
wrote the majority opinion

1092
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,234
in the historic
5-4 decision.

1093
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,003
The constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act
has been challenged...

1094
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,706
With eight weeks left until
the Republican National Convention in Tampa,

1095
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,142
speculation has turned
to Governor Romney's choice of running mate.

1096
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,144
...introduced
Representative Paul Ryan,

1097
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,180
one of the Republican party's
young conservative leaders as his running mate.

1098
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,983
Representative Todd Akin,
who won Missouri's GOP Senate primary

1099
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:37,420
earlier this month,
and who will face Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill,

1100
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,989
said Sunday that he misspoke
when he claimed "legitimate rape"...

1101
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,710
With three days to go before delegates
converge on Tampa Bay, Florida,

1102
00:47:43,732 --> 00:47:46,367
GOP officials are moving
forward with their plans

1103
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:49,136
to kick off the Republican
National Convention on Monday,

1104
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,839
despite the looming threat
of Tropical Storm Isaac.

1105
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:54,408
<i>The storm is currently
headed for Haiti.</i>

1106
00:47:54,442 --> 00:47:57,378
I'm gonna ask you to hold on
just a second, please.

1107
00:48:33,615 --> 00:48:36,583
Lance Corporal Herman Valenzuela
is on the phone.

1108
00:48:36,618 --> 00:48:39,153
Valenzuela is dead.

1109
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:41,789
No, he's not.
He's on the phone.

1110
00:48:41,823 --> 00:48:43,791
How'd you get that wrong?

1111
00:48:43,825 --> 00:48:46,326
There were two
Herman Valenzuelas.

1112
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:48,162
Both lance corporals.

1113
00:48:48,196 --> 00:48:49,763
<i>One was killed in action.</i>

1114
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:51,932
Why were you calling him
if you thought he was dead?

1115
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:54,768
The messages were left for him
before we got the service records.

1116
00:48:54,803 --> 00:48:57,171
We stopped calling,
but he'd been deployed.

1117
00:48:57,205 --> 00:48:59,773
And when he got home,
he got our messages and returned our call.

1118
00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:01,742
And that's when you gave
the green light?

1119
00:49:01,776 --> 00:49:03,444
We had Sweeney,
we had Hamni8...

1120
00:49:03,478 --> 00:49:05,312
- Charlie.
<i>- ...we had the report from the NGO,</i>

1121
00:49:05,346 --> 00:49:06,914
- we had my source...
- Who you won't reveal.

1122
00:49:06,948 --> 00:49:08,248
...we had the helo manifest,

1123
00:49:08,283 --> 00:49:10,551
we had Valenzuela
who was the crew chief.

1124
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:13,754
We had a story
that the US used sarin gas

1125
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:16,056
on a village in Pakistan
and we went.

1126
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,491
Anybody would have.

1127
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:19,693
Most people would have
gone months earlier.

1128
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:21,562
To not go would have
been to participate

1129
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:24,164
in the biggest
cover-up since...

1130
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:29,303
These were war crimes.

1131
00:49:32,373 --> 00:49:33,807
It was a Sunday special report.

1132
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:35,576
9:00 P.M. Eastern.

1133
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,312
Neilson tracking showed it was gonna be
a monster audience--

1134
00:49:38,346 --> 00:49:39,980
Three and a half, four million.

1135
00:49:40,048 --> 00:49:42,449
It ended up closer to six.

1136
00:49:44,052 --> 00:49:47,020
<i>By 10:05,
I knew we had a problem.</i>

1137
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:50,958
None of it was true.

1138
00:49:50,982 --> 00:49:52,720
