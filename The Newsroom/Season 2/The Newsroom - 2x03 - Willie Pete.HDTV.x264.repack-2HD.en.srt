1
00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:02,963
Have you ever heard anything
about a black op called Genoa?

2
00:00:02,997 --> 00:00:04,398
<i>We used sarin gas.</i>

3
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:07,232
You're talking about
a massive war crime.

4
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:12,603
<i>TMI</i> is doing full-on computer hacking
and Reese Lansing knows?

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,206
Reese has been ordering it.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,443
- You hacked my phone.
- You got some proof?

7
00:00:17,477 --> 00:00:19,680
I'll go to jail
before I'm blackmailed.

8
00:00:19,714 --> 00:00:21,482
- I didn't catch your name before.
- Hallie.

9
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:24,119
Would you mind just framing me up?
Mr. Romney's health care--

10
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:27,421
- That camera is pointed nowhere near my face, right?
- We're competitors.

11
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:30,390
The two of you are going to anchor
the 9/11 anniversary coverage.

12
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:32,325
On the 9th or 10th,
I'm going to get the flu

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,127
and you guys
are gonna take my desk.

14
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:35,563
What is it with you and Africa?

15
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:38,431
I want to be the go-to person
on something around here.

16
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,034
There's nothing
I can do for you.

17
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:42,203
If there's anyone who
wants this to be a story, it's me.

18
00:00:42,237 --> 00:00:44,901
- Something's going on.
<i>- Yeah, something's going on.</i>

when they are literally on the lines
fighting for our freedom.

28
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,975
Presidential candidate
Herman Cain will not apologize

29
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,513
for having the biggest, baddest,
greatest military on the planet.

30
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,150
And I don't apologize

- <i>even more than we already do.</i>
- Copy.

35
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,529
I think it's time
for American citizens and politicians

36
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,331
to show a surge of support

37
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:48,769
<i>and for us to reach out to our neighbors

39
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:54,108

at the selfless act

40
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:56,945
of volunteering to serve
in a time of war.

41
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:00,348
We have a culture right now
that doesn't say serve.

42
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:04,486
It doesn't say
don't think about yourself.

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,188
It says, "Me, me, me."

44
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:09,257
It's a very self-absorbed,
me-centered,

45
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:11,560
<i>excessive popular culture.</i>

46

47
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:16,998
<i>who are willing to step forward

48
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:20,435
They're willing to
sacrifice their lives

49
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:22,571
for this great country.

50
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:26,142
Stephen Hill is a decorated captain
in the US Army,

51
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:28,712
where he's been a reservist
for 20 years.

52
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:31,783
He is this very night
serving in combat in Iraq,

53
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:34,352
as he was last night
when he asked this question

54
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:37,955
via YouTube at the GOP debate
in Orlando, Florida.

55
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,558
In 2010, when I was
deployed to Iraq,

56
00:03:40,593 --> 00:03:42,127
I had to lie about who I was

57
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:43,629
because I'm a gay soldier

58
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:45,632
and I didn't want
to lose my job.

59
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:49,035
My question is,
under one of your presidencies,

60
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,138
do you intend to circumvent
the progress that's been made

61
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:54,340
for gay and lesbian soldiers
in the military?

62
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,080
That was a big room full
of Republican primary voters

63
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,116
booing an American
combat soldier

64
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,752
who, as he was speaking,
was in combat.

65
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:08,822
The audience members
who were booing were in Orlando.

66
00:04:08,856 --> 00:04:10,790
Soon they'll surely be in hell,

67
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,225
though not soon enough.

68
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:13,894
Not everyone was booing.

69
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:16,897
There were people in the audience
who heard Captain Hill say

70
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,899
that when he was deployed to Iraq,
he was worried

71
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:22,402
that if his sexuality was discovered,
they might not let him go--

72
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:26,239
As opposed to most of us who,
if told we were being deployed to Iraq,

73
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:28,608
would go Corporal Klinger
faster than you can pull on

74
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,611
a yellow taffeta picnic dress.

75
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,980
I'm sure there were even
some people in the building

76
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:34,615
who stood up for Captain Hill,

77
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,683
people who had the simple
strength of character

78
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:39,286
to turn to the fraction of a human
in the seat next to them

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,755
and say, "How many different
kinds of disgusting

80
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,324
do you have to be to boo a man

81
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:46,027
who volunteered to fight
and die for you?"

82
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:48,930
I'm sure those people
were there.

83
00:04:48,965 --> 00:04:50,566
I'm sure there were
many of them.

84
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:53,802
But unfortunately,
none of them were on the stage.

85
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,405
Not one of these would-be
commanders in chief

86
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:59,541
took a moment to stand
with a line officer.

87
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:01,443
They let him stand alone.

88
00:05:01,478 --> 00:05:05,381
Soldiers never do that.
Leaders never do that.

89
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:10,053
Witless bullies and hapless punks
do it all the time.

90
00:05:10,087 --> 00:05:14,124
The only president on the stage
last night was Stephen Hill.

91
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:16,760
Godspeed, Captain Hill,
and come home soon.

92
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:20,297
A grateful nation is waiting
to say thank you.

93
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:22,099
<i>That's </i>News Night
<i>for September 23rd.</i>

94
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,234
<i>Terry Smith is up next

95
00:05:24,268 --> 00:05:26,469
I'm Will McAvoy.
Good night.

96
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,774
When you turn to the monitor,
I need you to slide your chair

97
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,943
- back about an inch for the key light.
- Why?

98
00:05:32,978 --> 00:05:36,013
So the photons bounce off your face
and not your forehead.

99
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:37,247
I don't get it.

100
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,049
You have to slide
your chair back about an inch

101
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:40,985
when you turn to the monitor
so we can see your face.

102
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:42,453
- Is this a new problem?
- Yeah.

103
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:44,489
- Why?
- I guess you used to slide your chair back.

104
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,191
Why don't you adjust
the key light?

105
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,660
Because when you're not facing the monitor,
you're-- Never mind.

106
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,530
Number two: Don't stare at guests
who are wearing toupees.

107
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,098
I know.
I couldn't help it.

108
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,667
- Help it.
- I was mesmerized.

109
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,302
- And a little bored.
- Okay.

110
00:05:57,337 --> 00:06:00,272
Did I take you by surprise
with the witless bullies and hapless punks?

111
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,007
No, you left a message
for me last night.

112
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:05,211
I realized as I was saying it that
you never mentioned you got the message.

113
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,780
- I did and I approved.
- I wasn't asking for your approval.

114
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:09,782
- You were, but speaking of voicemail--
- No.

115
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:10,950
- Come on.
- Let it go.

116
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,351
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

117
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,053
You've asked me every day
for two months.

118
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,255
- There have been days when I haven't asked.
- You asked on Sundays.

119
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:17,756
Oh, Sundays are your holy day?

120
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,558
I don't remember the message.

121
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:21,794
You said, "I'm not just saying this
because I'm high."

122
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:24,330
- And then?
- I left the message in May.

123
00:06:24,364 --> 00:06:27,065
- "I'm not just saying this because I'm high..."
- I don't remember.

124
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,468
- How can you not remember?
- Really?

125
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:31,236
- Right, you were high.
- Yeah.

126
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,007
- Still...
- All right.

127
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,844
Witless bullies
and hapless punks.

128
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,446
- Too far?
- Not far enough.

129
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,815
You should have told what's-her-name
to go fuck herself, too.

130
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,216
The moderator.

131
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,184
I'm not allowed to make
that suggestion on television.

132
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,986
Make it anytime you want.
We're protected.

133
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,256
- Oh, you mean the tape.
- The tape, baby, the tape.

134
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,926
We're like made men.
We're like Joe Pesci in <i>Goodfellas</i>.

135
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:58,262
- He got shot.
- Before he got shot.

136
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:00,898
Before he got shot,
he wasn't a made man.

137
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:03,067
We're like James Caan
in <i>The Godfather</i>.

138
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:05,269
- Also shot. Many, many times.
- Who are we like?

139
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:07,972
Two guys who have a tape of their boss
admitting to phone hacking.

140
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:10,808
How do these people
boo a soldier?

141
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:12,744
How do the candidates
say nothing?

142
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:14,479
And how are you
a member of this party?

143
00:07:14,514 --> 00:07:16,181
I'm changing it from within.

144
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:17,816
Like Pacino in <i>Scarface</i>.

145
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:19,685
Have you ever seen
any of these movies?

146
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,453
- <i>I should.</i>
- Yeah.

147
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:23,956
So here's something.

148
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,524
You remember Nina Howard?

149
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,494
I definitely remember
Nina Howard.

150
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:30,230
She called Jan in the press office
a couple hours ago.

151
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:33,566
- She knows you didn't have the flu on 9/11.
- Oh. Shit, Charlie!

152
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,134
- I knew this was gonna happen.
- It's not that big a deal.

153
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:37,303
It's a very big deal.
I look like an idiot.

154
00:07:37,337 --> 00:07:38,771
- It could be worse.
- How?

155
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:40,706
<i>I</i> could look like an idiot.

156
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,543
- You know what?
- That was simple comedy structure.

157
00:07:43,577 --> 00:07:46,045
I had an open jump shot
and I took it.

158
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,546
What do you want
to do about this?

159
00:07:47,581 --> 00:07:49,982
We have two options.
Jan says we do nothing.

160
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:53,085
We don't respond,
it goes away in 48 hours.

161
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,689
The other option is
we stick to our story.

162
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:59,057
Tell me those options again.

163
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:02,061
We do nothing
or we stick to our story.

164
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:03,862
- There's a third option.
- No, there's not.

165
00:08:03,897 --> 00:08:06,765
- It involves having faith in my mission to civilize.
- No one has faith.

166
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:09,634
I really thought we were done
with the mission to civilize.

167
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:11,903
Was Don Quixote de la Mancha
done with his mission to civilize?

168
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:13,771
Yeah, he died of being crazy.

169
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:15,773
So that one you know,
but not <i>The Godfather</i>?

170
00:08:15,808 --> 00:08:19,411
We say nothing,
which is what I strongly recommend.

171
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:20,778
Or we tell the truth.

172
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:22,747
The truth isn't even
on the table.

173
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,182
- I sit down with her.
<i>- No.</i>

174
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:25,851
- I tell her exactly what happened.
- No.

175
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,453
- I appeal--
- To what?

176
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,254
To her God-given
humanity.

177
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:31,890
God didn't give her humanity.
That's why she's a gossip columnist.

178
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,691
God gave us all humanity.

179
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:35,560
Let's look at the tape
of the people booing a guy

180
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:37,195
while he was in the middle
of saving their lives.

181
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:38,697
I have no explanation for that,

182
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:40,632
but the bitchiness has to stop,
Charlie.

183
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,468
We're inhaling it
like it's a carbon emission

184
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:45,738
blowing out the exhaust pipe of
the crosstown bus we're stuck behind.

185
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:47,206
Snark is the idiot's
version of wit

186
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,708
and we're being polluted by it

187
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,410
like it's, you know,
like it's--

188
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:52,878
Blowing from the exhaust pipe
of the crosstown bus we're stuck behind.

189
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:55,181
Yes, that still works.
And all it takes, Charlie,

190
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,617
- all it takes is one great man.
<i>- Kill me.</i>

191
00:08:57,651 --> 00:08:59,619
- A friend of the angels.
- A close friend?

192
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:02,689
- Don't mock this.
- It's literally impossible not to.

193
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,190
There are things we can do,
Charlie.

194
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:06,259
Things we can do every day.
Things that are free.

195
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:09,095
We can be one inch nicer
to each other.

196
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:12,565
An inch more polite.
We can be decent.

197
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:17,003
Maybe.

198
00:09:17,037 --> 00:09:20,306
But in the meantime,
we should just keep lying about--

199
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,842
I'm gonna meet
with Nina Howard.

200
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,711
Nothing about
that idea is good.

201
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:26,312
How about its honesty
and honor?

202
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:28,481
Trumped by its peril
and stupidity.

203
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:31,750
Please ask Jan
to set up a meeting for Monday.

204
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,721
An off-the-record meeting.

205
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:38,491
And so it was that
the mild-mannered reporter

206
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:40,025
donned his cape
and tights--

207
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,061
And transformed himself
into a delusional drag queen.

208
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:45,263
<i>Okay, can I just say that
it's this kind of attitude</i>

209
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:47,232
that makes you Sancho
instead of the main guy?

210
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,301
I'd tell you to call me
and let me know how it goes,

211
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:52,037
- but I've got you on Google Alert.
- Got it.

212
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,540
<i>At our next event at Rollins Park,</i>

213
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,675
the governor's message
will be simple and clear.

214
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,945
<i>He'll be reiterating his role
as a business leader and job creator</i>

215
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:03,281
and he'll focus as well
on the failures of Obamacare

216
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:05,983
to meet the needs of the country.
Jim?

217
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:08,986
I'd like to read you the e-mail
you sent us last night.

218
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:12,123
<i>"At tomorrow's event, the governor's message
will be simple and clear.</i>

219
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:14,959
He'll be reiterating his role as a business
leader and job creator

220
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:17,095
<i>and he'll focus as well
on the failures of Obamacare</i>

221
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,331
<i>to meet the needs of the country."</i>

222
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:20,798
Is there a question?

223
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,934
Okay, Governor Romney said
we can't reduce our debt

224
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:25,170
- without changes to the entitlement programs.
- Mm-hmm.

225
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,372
- <i>What changes is he proposing?</i>
- He's laid out his plan.

226
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:28,840
- <i>No, he hasn't.</i>
<i>- Go to our website.</i>

227
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,375
- <i>I'm there right now.</i>
<i>- You can read about our plan.</i>

228
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:32,944
<i>There's no plan.</i>

229
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:35,714
Current seniors would have nothing to worry about.
We made a promise--

230
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:37,249
"Promise to our parents
and our grandparents

231
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:38,950
and that's a promise
we need to--"

232
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,552
- Okay, I get it.
<i>- Do you?</i>

233
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:42,187
- Yeah.
<i>- I don't think you do.</i>

234
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:45,324
Because while those are sentences
and everything, they're not a plan.

235
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,793
If we don't figure out how to stop
spending and cut this debt,

236
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:50,130
<i>we'll be leaving
a terrible burden to our children.</i>

237
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:53,000
There's no one who disagrees with that.
What's the governor's plan?

238
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:55,335
Obviously we have to look
at entitlement reform.

239
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,071
Okay, good.
What kinds of reforms?

240
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,706
That's all laid out
in the governor's plan.

241
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,276
- Are you a cyborg?
- Are you a moron?

242
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,378
You think you're scoring
wise-ass points

243
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,446
and he's plainly
fucking with you.

244
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,481
You've heard the only answer
you're going to hear.

245
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:10,952
Learn how this works,
'cause you're driving the rest of us crazy.

246
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:14,922
You can't blame me for trying.

247
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,691
I am.
I'm blaming you for trying.

248
00:11:16,725 --> 00:11:19,493
- Any other questions?
- Can I get 30 minutes with the candidate today?

249
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,996
- No. Anything else?
- Lunch will be?

250
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,832
- Turkey sandwiches.
- Turkey sandwiches.

251
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,875
Yeah?

252
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:36,177
- You can speed-read?
- I hope so.

253
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:39,414
Okay, well, I wanted to see if there was
anyone around with a military background.

254
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,050
- Why?
- Eric Sweeney is taking the train in

255
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:43,719
from Trenton
to sit down with me.

256
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:45,287
I want to make sure
I don't miss any acronyms.

257
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:48,390
- Ah, Jerry, I--
- Why is it so crazy that we'd use gas

258
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:50,058
if our soldiers were
in immediate danger?

259
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:51,960
For one thing,
we destroyed our chemical weapons

260
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:53,995
after the 1997 CWC accord.

261
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,131
- <i>The chemical weapon--</i>
- I know what the CWC is.

262
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:58,934
And that process was supposed to be
completed in 2007,

263
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,870
but wasn't and hasn't yet.
We have sarin gas.

264
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,641
I'm gonna go with you.
I want to meet Sweeney.

265
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,176
Now we're talking.
Noon?

266
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,811
- Come by and get me.
- Good morning.

267
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:10,179
- How you doing?
- Good.

268
00:12:10,213 --> 00:12:11,947
- Good.
- All right.

269
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,149
- You know what opened four days ago?
- What?

270
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:15,951
Park51, the Ground Zero mosque.

271
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,986
- It turns out the sky didn't fall down.
- It opened?

272
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,488
Nobody, including us,
covered it.

273
00:12:19,522 --> 00:12:21,457
I found out by walking in there.
I said, "You guys open?"

274
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,859
They said, "Yeah."
I wonder why people hate the media.

275
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:26,528
How did Nina Howard find out
I didn't have the flu?

276
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:28,163
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:29,732
You gave me a lecture
about trusting the staff.

278
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:31,200
- I was right.
- Somebody leaked it.

279
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:32,935
- Nobody on the staff.
- They were the only ones who knew.

280
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,171
Nobody on the staff
would leak it.

281
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:36,806
You see the problem here?

282
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,242
- Charlie said you're meeting with her.
- I am.

283
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:41,511
Would it mean anything if I told you
that was a terrible idea?

284
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:43,346
- <i>No.</i>
- What are you gonna say to her?

285
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,248
I'm gonna ask her if we can be
a little bit human for a day.

286
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:50,319
I'm gonna ask her if 9/11 can be declared
a scandal-free zone.

287
00:12:51,788 --> 00:12:55,056
You know,
I had a nice conversation with her once.

288
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:57,325
- When?
- When you were in the hospital

289
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,928
and she told me she knew you were high
the night we got bin Laden.

290
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:02,197
She didn't tell me she knew because
Reese had hacked my phone.

291
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:05,167
She couldn't,
but she expressed remorse.

292
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,501
We had a connection.

293
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,103
That's great.

294
00:13:08,138 --> 00:13:10,039
- And speaking of voicemail...
- We weren't.

295
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:11,140
- A little bit.
- No.

296
00:13:11,174 --> 00:13:12,675
- Tangentially.
- I don't remember.

297
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,478
"I'm not just saying this
because I'm high..."

298
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,812
Mac.

299
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:19,415
- You know what I think?
- What?

300
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:21,951
I think you got home
after the bin Laden broadcast

301
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:24,887
and for a minute,
just a minute,

302
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,422
you forgot that you
were mad at me.

303
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:27,957
- Listen.
<i>- You forgot for a minute</i>

304
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:30,626
<i>that you'd made a pledge
to be mad at me</i>

305
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,495
for the rest of your life.

306
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:45,708
Let's speak really quietly,
okay?

307
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,310
I'm not mad at you.
You didn't dent my fender.

308
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:50,379
You didn't stand me up
for a date.

309
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,281
- I'm not mad at you. I'm not your gay best friend.
- I know. God.

310
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:55,318
You were back with Brian for four months
while you were with me.

311
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:58,088
And you-- That's flat--
I don't get it.

312
00:13:58,122 --> 00:14:00,490
Do you wanna see the e-mails
you sent me while you were with him?

313
00:14:00,525 --> 00:14:04,127
I'm never gonna get it.
So the small favor you can do for me

314
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:07,631
is not saying something as inane as,
"You forgot you were mad at me."

315
00:14:07,665 --> 00:14:11,268
Because sometimes,
you're not as cute as you think you are.

316
00:14:13,304 --> 00:14:15,872
- You're right.
- I want to know who leaked the story.

317
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:27,284
<i>The campaign's happy
to announce the results</i>

318
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:29,253
<i>of the latest</i>
New Hampshire Journal<i> poll,</i>

319
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:32,556
which has Governor Romney
in the lead with 37%

320
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,758
of New Hampshire's
likely Republican voters,

321
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:38,062
well ahead of Rick Perry
with 18%,

322
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:39,997
Ron Paul with 14%,

323
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:41,966
then Michele Bachmann
and Herman Cain.

324
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,669
You forgot about Huntsman,
Gingrich, and Santorum.

325
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:46,404
- And soon you will, too.
- Taylor?

326
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:48,339
Oh, we have
a new student in class.

327
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:50,040
Jim Harper, ACN.

328
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:52,376
Jim Harper, ACN.

329
00:14:52,411 --> 00:14:54,946
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

330
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,615
When the gay soldier
asked his question,

331
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,051
did Will McAvoy
expect the candidates

332
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:02,287
to waterboard each member
of the audience

333
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:05,391
until they admitted to exercising
their First Amendment rights?

334
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:07,326
- I doubt it.
- What did he expect?

335
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:09,628
I guess for at least
one of them,

336
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:11,730
perhaps the front runner,
to tell the audience

337
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,867
that he wasn't interested in the votes
of anyone who was booing.

338
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:17,804
Not for nothing,
but he'd have won the election that night.

339
00:15:17,838 --> 00:15:20,240
How long have you been
covering politics?

340
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:22,909
- Almost two weeks.
- Right.

341
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:24,811
What is your question, Jim?

342
00:15:24,846 --> 00:15:28,581
In the past, Governor Romney said that
his proudest accomplishment

343
00:15:28,616 --> 00:15:31,550
in public service was bringing
health care reform to Massachusetts.

344
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:35,287
I've been to 28 events in 11 days
and he hasn't brought that up.

345
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:37,223
- And your question?
- We're really gonna do this?

346
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:38,790
Has anyone
on the bus asked why?

347
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:40,826
- No. Thank God you got here.
- Taylor, why is it--

348
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,528
Governor Romney is very proud
of his accomplishments

349
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:45,897
in Massachusetts
with regard to health care.

350
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:48,401
But his plan is nothing
like Obamacare,

351
00:15:48,435 --> 00:15:52,338
which the governor has promised to repeal
on his first day in office.

352
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,774
- What exactly are the differences?
- All right, that's it, guys.

353
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,278
- One more question?
- Sure.

354
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:01,014
What do you expect us
to report tonight?

355
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:03,683
<i>The governor was
in good spirits today as the campaign</i>

356
00:16:03,717 --> 00:16:06,119
touted the results of the latest
<i>New Hampshire Journal</i> poll...

357
00:16:06,153 --> 00:16:08,655
A new poll has the Romney campaign
feeling good about its chances...

358
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,490
And a senior campaign
spokesperson reiterating

359
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:13,026
the candidate's pledge that a President Romney
would repeal Obamacare...

360
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,794
...and expressing
no expectation of surges

361
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:16,996
from Huntsman, Gingrich,
or Santorum.

362
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,930
With the Romney
campaign in Concord,

363
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,799
I'm Jim Harper, ACN.

364
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,868
<i>I was stationed with
a MARSOC unit in J-bad.</i>

365
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:26,571
- Marine Special Operations Command in Jalalabad.
- I know.

366
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:28,573
Intel had location
on Marine POWs

367
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,374
who'd been separated
from their unit three days earlier

368
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:31,842
during a firefight
in the Hindu Kush.

369
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:33,344
They'd been smuggled
across the border.

370
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:34,878
Pakistani Taliban
intended to sell them

371
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:36,747
to Al-Qaeda
for propaganda purposes.

372
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:38,549
You mean like,
"Hey, look, we got some Americans"?

373
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:41,052
I mean like, "Hey, look,
we beheaded some."

374
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,722
We had to get to them before they
moved again or else we'd lose them.

375
00:16:43,756 --> 00:16:45,590
The target was a village
inside the FATA.

376
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,026
- What were you told to expect?
- Taliban fighters.

377
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,595
Potentially Pakistani QRF
responding to our border invasion.

378
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,532
- Quick reaction force.
- We ran rehearsals for 48 hours.

379
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,734
- That's when things got different.
- What was different?

380
00:16:55,768 --> 00:16:57,970
We were practicing
in full MOPP gear.

381
00:16:58,004 --> 00:16:59,738
Mission oriented
protective posture.

382
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:01,774
- It's like a hazmat suit.
- I know.

383
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:04,009
Two helos, 15 operators each.

384
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:06,378
We cross into Pakistan,
no IDs, no dog tags.

385
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:09,114
- Without permission?
- I'm not the guy who gets permission.

386
00:17:09,148 --> 00:17:11,617
Two helos.
Any backup?

387
00:17:11,651 --> 00:17:12,985
It was two years ago.

388
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,488
I think I remember we asked for
an AC-130 Spectre gunship

389
00:17:16,523 --> 00:17:18,123
to loiter on
the Afghanistan side,

390
00:17:18,158 --> 00:17:20,926
but either it didn't get authorized
or it didn't show up.

391
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,661
The 60s had
.50-cal door guns.

392
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,463
AH-1s had rockets
on the skids.

393
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:25,564
AH-1s are Cobras.

394
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,132
We had a few guys
carrying new HE rounds

395
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:28,934
for the M203s, M79s.

396
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:32,037
We got on board at 0400 and were
on the target before dawn.

397
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:33,939
- HE is--
- High explosive.

398
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:35,741
- Everything all right here?
- We're good, thank you.

399
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:37,242
Amy, could you do me a favor

400
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:38,976
and not seat anyone nearby
if you don't have to?

401
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:41,746
Yeah.

402
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:45,717
Things went bad right away.

403
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:47,352
You want to make God laugh,

404
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:49,120
tell Him you rehearsed
for an extraction.

405
00:17:49,154 --> 00:17:51,121
A bunch of fighters come out of the hills
as soon as we land,

406
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:52,689
and I'm sorry for the language,
ma'am,

407
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:54,658
but there was a shit-ton
of civilians in the village

408
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:56,627
and we weren't
prepared for that.

409
00:17:56,662 --> 00:18:00,397
The helos started laying
down white phosphorus to cover us.

410
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,500
You're saying you shot
white phosphorus?

411
00:18:03,535 --> 00:18:04,668
Yes, ma'am.

412
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:06,336
White phosphorus?

413
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:08,372
- What does it do?
- Depends how you use it.

414
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:10,006
I thought we were
using it for cover.

415
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:12,209
Then one of the choppers
fired a missile right near us.

416
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:13,777
<i>We're going door-to-door
looking for our guys.</i>

417
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:15,712
All of a sudden,
I'm tripping over people screaming.

418
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:18,181
Women, children,
boils and burns on their faces.

419
00:18:18,216 --> 00:18:20,117
Some of them passed out.
I hadn't seen anything like it.

420
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:22,886
A couple of my buddies grabbed our guys
out of a hole in one of the houses,

421
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,622
hit 'em with atropine, dragged them to the helos,
and we all got out of there.

422
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:27,057
So later,
I'm talking to the crew,

423
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:28,658
and I ask them about
the weapons package.

424
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:30,393
Why did the white
phosphorous do that?

425
00:18:30,428 --> 00:18:31,828
The guy said it wasn't
white phosphorous.

426
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,930
I said,
"Well, what was it?"

427
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,669
He said, "Sarin."

428
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,520
Would you write down as many names
as you can remember, please?

429
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:13,535
Am I about to be murdered?

430
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,470
You look good, Nina.

431
00:19:16,706 --> 00:19:19,140
Are you sure the AWM
executive dining room

432
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:20,742
is the safest place to meet?

433
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:22,144
I am.
I've had it closed.

434
00:19:22,178 --> 00:19:23,878
You came in through
the freight entrance

435
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,714
and rode the elevator alone
except for this gentleman,

436
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,250
<i>who's a former New York City
police detective.</i>

437
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:29,818
You have that kind of muscle?

438
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:31,153
Right now,
<i>you</i> have that kind of muscle.

439
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:32,954
But I don't want to talk to you
about power today.

440
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:35,857
<i>I want to talk to you about something else.
Come on over and sit down.</i>

441
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:38,427
- Would you like a mimosa?
- What?

442
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:40,463
- <i>Champagne and orange juice.</i>
- I know what it is.

443
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:43,366
Pierre,
a mimosa for Miss Howard, please.

444
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,667
No pulp, correct?

445
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:47,202
- Yes.
- I learned that on Facebook.

446
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,903
- No pulp.
- Right away.

447
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:58,146
- Is his name really Pierre?
- No.

448
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:00,115
- What's going on?
- I'm glad you asked.

449
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:01,383
I think anybody would have.

450
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,318
You can start a revolution,
Nina.

451
00:20:03,353 --> 00:20:04,853
You can fire the shot
heard 'round the world.

452
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:06,755
And that's an apt analogy,

453
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,325
because no one knows which side
the guy was on who fired the shot.

454
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,462
But nonetheless, it led to a revolution
that it was good that we won.

455
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:13,563
- Will.
- Yeah?

456
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:15,064
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

457
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:16,533
I didn't have the flu.

458
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:18,535
We felt that with
the controversy created

459
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,237
by my remarks
about the Tea Party,

460
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:23,307
the 9/11 anniversary coverage
should be handled by someone else.

461
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:26,277
And so Sloan Sabbith
and Elliot Hirsch anchored

462
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,313
and I pretended
to have the flu.

463
00:20:28,347 --> 00:20:29,881
You forgot to say
we're off the record.

464
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:32,417
We're not.
We're on the record.

465
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,587
Why are you being this way?

466
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:38,423
Wayne.

467
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:43,829
- Oh, dear God.
- Yep.

468
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,931
I don't believe in censorship,

469
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:48,634
but I'm a big believer
in self-censorship.

470
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:50,269
You've got a scoop.

471
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,938
You can write a story
that embarrasses me and the network

472
00:20:52,972 --> 00:20:55,107
or you can say
that's all the story is.

473
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:59,011
You can say,
"I've had a belly full of this bullying bullshit."

474
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:01,813
You're financially secure?
You've invested wisely?

475
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:03,915
I invested in my parents' will.

476
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,617
So you don't need the $250?

477
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:07,352
Oh, I'd get a lot more
than $250.

478
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:10,355
Sorry, you don't need the $275.

479
00:21:11,824 --> 00:21:14,525
Did Reese or Leona Lansing
take you off the anniversary

480
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,528
or did you do it voluntarily?

481
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,998
Charlie Skinner took me off.

482
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:23,967
And I get that's
where the story is,

483
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:26,002
but, Nina, are we okay
with being <i>Mean Girls</i>

484
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:29,406
and <i>Heathers</i> and whatever
the male equivalent of that is?

485
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,574
- <i>Lord of the Flies</i>.
<i>- Lord of the Flies</i>.

486
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:34,044
Well, in <i>Lord of the Flies</i>--
Sure, yes, <i>Lord of the Flies</i>.

487
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:35,879
9/11 is a sacred day.

488
00:21:35,914 --> 00:21:38,249
- Maybe that could be the one day--
- All right.

489
00:21:38,283 --> 00:21:40,552
- What?
- I won't run it.

490
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:42,487
Seriously?

491
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:43,888
I liked that you
told me the truth

492
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:45,790
when I asked if you took
yourself off voluntarily.

493
00:21:45,824 --> 00:21:47,792
- You did?
- Yeah.

494
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:52,030
So it worked?

495
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:54,966
Wow, we--
Look at that.

496
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:00,906
Okay, well,
enjoy the rest of your mimosa

497
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,309
and that'll--
That's that.

498
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:04,911
- That's that.
- All right.

499
00:22:04,945 --> 00:22:07,113
- Okay.
- Okay.

500
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:25,932
Do you think you'd like
to go out sometime

501
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:28,201
<i>to dinner or a movie
on a date with me?</i>

502
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:31,071
I'd love to, but I won't.

503
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:32,973
Okay.

504
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:38,245
- All right.
- I'm sorry, you'd love to, but you won't?

505
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,947
You've forgotten that I heard

506
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:43,250
the voicemail that you left
for MacKenzie.

507
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:45,152
Right.

508
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:47,955
The voicemail I left--
Wayne, could you stop playing for a minute?

509
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:50,457
- We're good.
- I would love to go out with you.

510
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:52,993
I wanted to go out with you
New Year's Eve a year ago

511
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:54,495
the first time that you told me

512
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:56,330
that you had no respect
for me and what I do.

513
00:22:56,364 --> 00:22:58,565
But you're in love
with MacKenzie.

514
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,769
I'm not. I was years ago,
but we just work together.

515
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:04,605
Now, I like her,
I depend on her, she's my EP,

516
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,507
but she runs my show
and that's it.

517
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,308
- The message said--
- You don't have to say what it said.

518
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:09,944
- It said--
- It's all right.

519
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:12,546
It said, "Hey, Mac, it's me.

520
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,884
Look, I'm not just saying this
because I'm high.

521
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:18,685
I've never stopped loving you.

522
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,921
You were
spectacular tonight."

523
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:25,225
Then there's a pause
and you say,

524
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:27,260
"Can you believe
we got Obama?"

525
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:31,098
- I meant bin Laden.
- Yeah, I know.

526
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:33,600
- And that was a long time ago.
- It was May.

527
00:23:33,634 --> 00:23:37,070
I'd eaten two massive--
we're off the record now--

528
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:39,005
- cookies laced with--
- I know. I know.

529
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,573
We'd been on the air
till 4:00 A.M.

530
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:43,510
I had adrenaline and THC
coursing through my, you know--

531
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:44,778
- Brain?
- Yes!

532
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:47,315
I don't know what courses
through your brain,

533
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:49,951
but I listened to
that voicemail 100 times

534
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:53,287
before I destroyed it
and that message was the real thing.

535
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,694
Didn't you ever wonder
why she didn't call you back?

536
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:01,696
You guys erased the message.

537
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,664
Well, you didn't know that
at the time.

538
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:05,867
You know, I thought...

539
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:08,570
What, you thought
she'd moved on?

540
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:11,205
- Uh-huh.
- You're an idiot.

541
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:14,175
Yeah.

542
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,148
So, no to the date,

543
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:22,750
- but I thought everything else went really well.
- Mm-hmm.

544
00:24:22,785 --> 00:24:25,620
Welcome to the high ground
in McAvoy's team of champions.

545
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:28,823
And thank you.

546
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:33,694
- The guy's paid for an hour, so...
- Okay.

547
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:37,564
It was nice of you
to destroy the message.

548
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:45,972
They'll take you back down
when you're ready.

549
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:52,077
You asked him to tell you
classified information and he did?

550
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,380
- I know.
- Whistle-blowers can be patriots.

551
00:24:54,414 --> 00:24:56,181
And he doesn't
remember the date?

552
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:58,784
He remembers
it was around March 9, 2009.

553
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:00,519
Do you remember dates
from two years ago?

554
00:25:00,553 --> 00:25:04,223
I would if I dropped sarin gas
on a small town.

555
00:25:04,257 --> 00:25:07,126
- And he said they shot white phosphorus?
- Yeah.

556
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:10,162
If they shot white phosphorus
into an enclosed area,

557
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:12,132
that alone would be
chemical warfare.

558
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,000
Just the white phosphorus.

559
00:25:14,035 --> 00:25:16,069
- What about his discharge?
<i>- Honorable.</i>

560
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:18,238
- Has he talked to anyone else?
- No, just me.

561
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,140
- Us.
- Why?

562
00:25:20,175 --> 00:25:22,576
- Nobody's asked.
- That's a bullshit answer.

563
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:24,312
- No, it's not.
- It is.

564
00:25:24,346 --> 00:25:26,514
- Did his hands shake or were they steady?
<i>- Steady.</i>

565
00:25:26,548 --> 00:25:29,083
He remembered a lot of details
and his story sounded a little rehearsed.

566
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:32,053
- Didn't to me.
<i>- No criminal record and we're checking his credit.</i>

567
00:25:32,088 --> 00:25:33,722
Guy owes money on a Jet Ski,
we're not gonna believe him?

568
00:25:33,756 --> 00:25:35,457
I've never flown an MH-60,

569
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,859
but the old Hueys couldn't
handle that altitude, right?

570
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:39,527
He said it was a Black Hawk?

571
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:42,363
Black Hawks are what we sent in
to get bin Laden.

572
00:25:42,398 --> 00:25:44,332
Abbottabad is 4,000 feet
above sea level,

573
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,869
and most of the villages
in Waziristan are over 9,000.

574
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:48,803
That's pretty thin air
for rotating blades.

575
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,905
Maybe it wasn't a Black Hawk
or maybe, excuse me,

576
00:25:50,939 --> 00:25:52,707
we're not experts
in military helicopters.

577
00:25:52,741 --> 00:25:54,942
- She is.
- I'm not.

578
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:57,845
Well, obviously
you have to follow up.

579
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,181
Just do it quietly
and carefully.

580
00:26:00,215 --> 00:26:02,850
We understand we're talking about
an impeachable offense?

581
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:04,685
- It's a war crime.
- We've committed them before.

582
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:07,321
I know.
I was there.

583
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:11,392
- Just can you give us a second?
- Yeah.

584
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:17,265
Do you believe this story?

585
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,567
I mean, you can't possibly
believe this story.

586
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:21,336
No.

587
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,870
But what if someone
else confirms?

588
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:24,838
At what point
do we have to take it seriously?

589
00:26:24,873 --> 00:26:27,608
We'll never find that out.

590
00:26:27,642 --> 00:26:29,509
All right.

591
00:26:29,543 --> 00:26:32,445
I'm commandeering
this desk clump right here.

592
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,781
Anyone who works here,
move your stuff someplace else.

593
00:26:34,815 --> 00:26:37,016
Martin, Tamara, Tess,
you're working with me.

594
00:26:37,051 --> 00:26:38,284
- <i>Maggie.</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

595
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,552
You're on this team.

596
00:26:39,587 --> 00:26:41,587
We're splitting this list
into five sections

597
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:44,957
and we don't stop until
we have tracked down every name on it.

598
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:47,560
All right. I don't know what
you're talking about.

599
00:26:47,594 --> 00:26:49,128
I'm gonna brief you.
Everybody huddle up.

600
00:26:49,163 --> 00:26:51,864
Jerry, this is something
they and you do

601
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:54,133
when they and you
have nothing else to do.

602
00:26:54,168 --> 00:26:56,135
Rundown meeting.

603
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,438
I'll brief everyone after.

604
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,441
- How was the doctor?
- I'm good to go.

605
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:03,977
I could swallow
a petri dish full of smallpox,

606
00:27:04,011 --> 00:27:06,079
and my immune system would
laugh the laugh of the righteous.

607
00:27:06,114 --> 00:27:07,781
- Malaria?
- Covered.

608
00:27:07,816 --> 00:27:10,818
- Mefloquine or doxycycline?
- I'm not sure.

609
00:27:10,852 --> 00:27:13,588
<i>You want to be sure because
mefloquine has possible side effects.</i>

610
00:27:13,622 --> 00:27:15,523
Mefloquine.

611
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:17,158
I told you to get
the doxycycline.

612
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:18,960
Yes, but one of them is for
people with fair skin, and that's me.

613
00:27:18,995 --> 00:27:20,929
Do you know what the
possible side effects are?

614
00:27:20,963 --> 00:27:23,231
- Nope.
- Check it out.

615
00:27:27,637 --> 00:27:29,738
All right, around the table.

616
00:27:29,772 --> 00:27:32,140
The court's gonna rule
on the ACA early next year.

617
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:34,376
Justice is declining to appeal
to the 11th Circuit.

618
00:27:34,411 --> 00:27:37,479
Saudi Arabian women will be given
the right to vote in 2015.

619
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:39,147
Romney's meeting
with Trump tomorrow.

620
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:41,917
- Oh, my God!
- There it is.

621
00:27:44,153 --> 00:27:46,722
- "Depression, confusion, hallucinations..."
- Yeah.

622
00:27:46,756 --> 00:27:48,523
"...severe vomiting,
suicidal thoughts,

623
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:50,992
<i>homicidal thoughts,
and extreme fear."</i>

624
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:52,861
Easy enough to understand
where the extreme fear comes from.

625
00:27:52,895 --> 00:27:55,497
- Anything else?
- "Itching."

626
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:58,166
I'm gonna be itchy
while I'm confused and hallucinating.

627
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,335
If at all possible,
have the suicidal thoughts

628
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,638
- before the homicidal thoughts.
- Didn't you get the same thing?

629
00:28:02,672 --> 00:28:05,574
I got the doxycycline.
I don't have fair skin, just soft skin.

630
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:07,175
Does doxycycline
have side effects?

631
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,611
- Sun sensitivity.
- Okay.

632
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:12,881
Don't take it.
Go back and tell them you want the doxy.

633
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:18,252
You already took it.

634
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:20,321
I can feel my mood changing.
I can feel it.

635
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,490
- It's happening right now.
- Let's keep going.

636
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:24,826
There's Friday's address
at the UN by Mahmoud Abbas

637
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,828
- pressing the case for Palestinian--
- Oh, shut up, Martin.

638
00:28:26,862 --> 00:28:28,296
The UN can go to hell.

639
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:31,433
The drug takes about
a week to kick in.

640
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:33,735
- <i>When did you take the pill?</i>
- 10 minutes ago.

641
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:35,703
- So...
- I'm confused

642
00:28:35,738 --> 00:28:37,973
and experiencing extreme fear.

643
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,674
Uh-huh.
Keep going.

644
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,342
The Conrad Murray trial
begins tomorrow.

645
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:43,578
That's 30 seconds
buried deep somewhere,

646
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:45,146
<i>preferably when
we're in a commercial.</i>

647
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:46,815
- Good afternoon.
- How'd it go?

648
00:28:46,849 --> 00:28:48,916
I have two things to say:
People are fundamentally good

649
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:51,853
and who the fuck leaked
I wasn't sick on 9/11?

650
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:54,155
Everyone's gonna close their eyes
including me,

651
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,092
and the person who couldn't
keep their mouth shut is gonna raise their hand.

652
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:58,893
That wouldn't work.
That doesn't make any sense.

653
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:01,463
- Can I ask something?
- Sure, this meeting's off the rails.

654
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,999
Saturday, the day before yesterday,
there was an OWS march.

655
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,834
It didn't make it
to the 2:00 rundown.

656
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:07,235
Was it out this morning
at 11:00?

657
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,571
Yes. I put it up
this morning at 11:00.

658
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:11,806
There was a march through
the financial district that was interrupted

659
00:29:11,841 --> 00:29:15,076
by the NYPD using excessive force
and pepper spray without being provoked.

660
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:18,346
I saw the film. I don't know.
Maybe. If there's time.

661
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,616
There's time right there
where Mitt Romney meets Donald Trump.

662
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,217
Oh, we're totally
doing that story.

663
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:25,587
And seriously, when I find out
which one of your roommates,

664
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:29,057
which one of your boyfriends,
which one of your baristas gave me up--

665
00:29:29,092 --> 00:29:32,260
I know some of you have
special relationships with your baristas.

666
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:34,129
I don't understand
that part of the world,

667
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,664
but I am gonna
own somebody here.

668
00:29:35,698 --> 00:29:37,733
There's gonna be
a heartache tonight.

669
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:39,668
How are you even supposed to know
if you're delusional?

670
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:41,369
This was a colossal
waste of time,

671
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,738
so I'm going to try
meeting with graphics.

672
00:29:49,445 --> 00:29:51,880
Mac.

673
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:53,948
I'm sorry about this morning.

674
00:29:53,983 --> 00:29:55,883
I don't know
where that came from.

675
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:58,652
I know where it came from,
but still...

676
00:30:00,555 --> 00:30:04,758
Honestly, I'm impressed
it doesn't happen more.

677
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:06,694
Impressed is the wrong word.

678
00:30:13,902 --> 00:30:16,236
I can't think of the right word.

679
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,171
That's okay.

680
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:20,641
- Anyway...
- All right.

681
00:30:22,611 --> 00:30:24,712
Nothing on the march
in New York on Saturday.

682
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:26,581
A friend of mine
in the newsroom's gonna lose it.

683
00:30:26,615 --> 00:30:28,616
One, two, three.

684
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,953
- Ah!
- Tequila! Whoo!

685
00:30:31,987 --> 00:30:33,822
What does that do for you,
shouting "tequila"?

686
00:30:33,856 --> 00:30:36,224
- How does that enhance the experience?
- I don't know.

687
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:37,692
- Until you do...
- Stop?

688
00:30:37,727 --> 00:30:39,628
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- What was the girl's name?

689
00:30:39,662 --> 00:30:41,563
- It doesn't matter.
- It does because I don't want to accidentally

690
00:30:41,597 --> 00:30:43,498
use her real name when
I'm writing the story in my blog.

691
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,000
Don't write it in your blog.

692
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:46,969
- "Tales From the Trail."
- Write about Romney.

693
00:30:47,003 --> 00:30:48,971
When Romney jumps off a <i>Sex and the City</i>
tour bus to chase a girl,

694
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:50,739
I'll definitely write about it.
Now, what was her name?

695
00:30:50,774 --> 00:30:52,808
Guys, I think Jim
would like a little space on this.

696
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:54,944
- We can just leave it alone.
- Thank you.

697
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,845
- What was her name?
<i>- Maggie.</i>

698
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,047
Her name is Maggie.

699
00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:01,016
How did you know that?

700
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:03,385
You've called me Maggie twice
since you got here.

701
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,021
- Ooh!
- Tequila!

702
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:08,490
- Cameron.
- 30 minutes with the candidate?

703
00:31:08,524 --> 00:31:10,292
- Yeah.
- Nope.

704
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:21,703
Come on in.

705
00:31:21,738 --> 00:31:25,040
Okay, so what are you--
What's happening here?

706
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:27,443
I started by putting
tires on my chair.

707
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:29,245
Tires?

708
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,481
Little tires.
They go on your chair.

709
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,916
They give you better traction
to zip around the room

710
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,551
and then there were some parts
that were squeaking,

711
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:36,186
so I got some WD-40
and here I am.

712
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,021
Are you gonna be able
to put this back together?

713
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:39,856
Yeah, I'm good with my hands.
I'm handy, mechanical.

714
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,591
What can I do for you?

715
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:43,059
I'm having a tough time
with Zane.

716
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:44,828
Aren't you always
having a tough time with him?

717
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,430
Not because of me.
I'm delightful.

718
00:31:46,464 --> 00:31:48,799
Here's the thing--
Lockheed is a good buy right now

719
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:50,300
because they make
the Hellfire missile,

720
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:51,835
which is shot out
of a Predator drone.

721
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:53,503
I'm advising my viewers
not to buy the stock.

722
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,504
You just said
it was a good buy.

723
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,039
It's a great buy
if you like money.

724
00:31:56,073 --> 00:31:57,607
But you think
it's an immoral stock.

725
00:31:57,642 --> 00:31:59,542
- I do. You know why?
- Yeah, 'cause they make drone missiles.

726
00:31:59,577 --> 00:32:02,145
- You get me.
- Zane doesn't want you to go on the air and say that.

727
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:03,613
That's close.

728
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:05,049
You already went on the air and said it
and now Zane's pissed.

729
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:06,417
That's exactly it, yeah.

730
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:08,352
Okay, personally,
I think that your position is commendable,

731
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:10,288
- but you have to listen to your EP.
- Okay.

732
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:11,790
- All right.
- And one more thing.

733
00:32:11,824 --> 00:32:13,558
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- I'm pretty sure I'm the leak.

734
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:16,095
- Say again?
- Will not having the flu--

735
00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:18,998
I'm pretty sure I'm the leak.
I'm the leak.

736
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:23,335
- How'd that happen?
- A guy invited me to a wedding.

737
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,170
<i>When I was told I would
be doing the 9/11 coverage,</i>

738
00:32:25,205 --> 00:32:26,638
I had to tell him why
I couldn't go to the wedding

739
00:32:26,673 --> 00:32:28,140
and I could tell
he didn't quite believe me,

740
00:32:28,175 --> 00:32:30,743
<i>so I had to make
a very convincing and detailed case</i>

741
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:32,879
because I told him
before Will didn't get the flu.

742
00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:34,814
- You see my point?
- Yeah.

743
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:36,349
A guy invited you to a wedding?

744
00:32:36,384 --> 00:32:38,485
Just a friend.
That's not important information.

745
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,221
How'd the story have gotten
from the wedding guy to Nina Howard?

746
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:43,390
- Nina has a book agent.
- Yeah?

747
00:32:43,424 --> 00:32:46,126
The wedding guy was--
You told Nina Howard's agent?

748
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,462
In my defense, I was accused of
lying to get out of a date.

749
00:32:48,496 --> 00:32:50,363
- That's a terrible defense.
- I agree, so what would you do?

750
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:53,032
- Don't say a word to Will.
- Just tell Will the truth, right?

751
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:55,268
Okay, I'll do it your way

752
00:32:55,302 --> 00:32:56,670
while I'm formulating
another plan.

753
00:32:56,704 --> 00:32:58,305
- Run that plan by me first, okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

754
00:32:58,339 --> 00:33:00,240
Thanks for agreeing with me
on the immoral stock.

755
00:33:00,274 --> 00:33:02,074
And I in no way think
that this here

756
00:33:02,109 --> 00:33:03,909
<i>is a reaction
to your breakup with Maggie.</i>

757
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:06,745
Well, you were gonna go to a wedding
with a book agent for no reason at all

758
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,880
and book agents
beat their wives.

759
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:10,615
Uh, I don't think they do.

760
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,018
- Ask around.
- I will.

761
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:15,053
<i>- Taylor.</i>
<i>- Jim.</i>

762
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:18,557
In June, Governor Romney said,
"I believe the world is getting warmer

763
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:20,526
and I believe humans
have contributed to that."

764
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,429
Last week he said,
"Do I think the world is getting hotter?

765
00:33:23,464 --> 00:33:27,133
Yeah. I don't know
if it's caused mostly by humans."

766
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,801
What new information raised doubts
for the governor?

767
00:33:28,835 --> 00:33:31,236
Governor Romney isn't willing to spend
trillions of dollars

768
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:33,038
on something
he doesn't know the answer to.

769
00:33:33,072 --> 00:33:34,706
Got it, but that
wasn't my question.

770
00:33:34,741 --> 00:33:37,910
In June, this last June,
102 days ago--

771
00:33:37,944 --> 00:33:39,912
Asked and answered, Jim.

772
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:58,633
I read some of your stuff
last night in my room.

773
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,802
That's a little creepy.

774
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:02,771
Especially in the quiet voice
you're using.

775
00:34:02,805 --> 00:34:04,639
You know,
I'm trying to compliment you.

776
00:34:04,673 --> 00:34:07,208
I thought they were really good
except for the parts that weren't.

777
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:09,510
And you've been kind of nasty to me
since I got here.

778
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:11,512
Because we live here
and you're visiting.

779
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:13,881
You're slumming it.
You're a senior studio producer

780
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,883
and you come up here
like Captain America

781
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,752
- thinking you're gonna school us.
- None of that is true.

782
00:34:17,786 --> 00:34:19,386
And some of you
need to be schooled.

783
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:21,922
- This is my third presidential campaign.
- Your third?

784
00:34:21,957 --> 00:34:24,425
I took my junior year off
from college to cover Kerry.

785
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:25,960
Why'd you leave
the <i>Denver Post</i>?

786
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:28,028
Because once McCain
got the nomination four years later,

787
00:34:28,063 --> 00:34:30,197
I was replaced by someone
with more experience

788
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:32,132
who didn't ask questions
I wanted answers to.

789
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,833
- Like what?
- Like women's issues.

790
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:35,735
- Choice?
- Yeah.

791
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,671
Choice is the only
women's issue.

792
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:40,106
And it's just a women's issue
because we all got pregnant

793
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,907
reading
<i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>.

794
00:34:43,477 --> 00:34:46,244
- So you started your own website...
- With an investor.

795
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,847
...to make sure you didn't get bigfooted
once Romney gets the nomination...

796
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:51,115
- To write in my own voice.
- ...and ask the questions you wanted answers to.

797
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,119
- Yeah.
- How's that part been going?

798
00:34:55,408 --> 00:34:58,423
I'm starting to understand
why Maggie was running so fast.

799
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:02,960
I was hoping you could run a couple names
through your VA database for me.

800
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,862
Yes, I'm trying to reach
Humboldt County Records.

801
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:07,131
Marines,
probably special ops, MARSOC,

802
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,500
and stationed
in or near J-bad.

803
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:12,336
We have one source
and we're trying to get the next.

804
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:15,140
Can you tell me, have you ever heard
the name Operation Genoa?

805
00:35:15,174 --> 00:35:17,308
- Genoa.
- We should be checking Twitter, too.

806
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:20,612
- You think somebody saw it?
- Somebody saw us getting bin Laden.

807
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:22,547
I don't know.
I'm a ticking time bomb.

808
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:24,049
That was in--
Thank you.

809
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,584
That was in a suburban
neighborhood.

810
00:35:25,618 --> 00:35:27,519
This is in the middle
of a pile of rocks.

811
00:35:27,553 --> 00:35:29,788
I'd be amazed if
a village in North Waziristan

812
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:32,090
has cell service,
let alone Twitter users.

813
00:35:32,124 --> 00:35:33,992
They have cell service.

814
00:35:34,026 --> 00:35:35,894
How do we search
every tweet that was posted

815
00:35:35,928 --> 00:35:38,497
in the area sometime
around March 2009?

816
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:40,532
You're gonna use
something called Topsy.

817
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,501
It narrows the area
and the dates.

818
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:45,170
And you're gonna need a translator,
either Urdu or Pashto.

819
00:35:45,204 --> 00:35:47,372
I'll get on it.

820
00:35:49,074 --> 00:35:51,376
You should have today's
talking points in your e-mail,

821
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,377
but I will just
reiterate them here.

822
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:56,947
Governor Romney's very proud
of his 59-point jobs plan.

823
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:59,283
We've named it Day One, Job One

824
00:35:59,317 --> 00:36:01,151
<i>and it will lower
the unemployment rate</i>

825
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:04,654
<i>from President Obama's
9.1 to 5.9,</i>

826
00:36:04,688 --> 00:36:06,922
<i>creating 12 million new jobs.</i>

827
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:07,956
Everybody have that?

828
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:09,658
- <i>Taylor?</i>
- Jim.

829
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:12,861
Moody's released a report
saying that 12 million new jobs

830
00:36:12,895 --> 00:36:14,262
will be created in
the next four years

831
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:15,863
no matter who the president is.

832
00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:17,498
<i>Does the governor have
any comment on that?</i>

833
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:19,233
The governor's
59-point jobs plan

834
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,769
will create 12 million new jobs
in his first term,

835
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,272
cutting the unemployment
rate almost in half.

836
00:36:24,306 --> 00:36:27,007
5.9 isn't almost
half of 9.1

837
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:29,977
and Moody's says that
no matter who the president is--

838
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:32,379
We think it matters very much
who the president is.

839
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:34,048
- <i>Follow up?</i>
- Yes.

840
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:36,584
Is there somebody inside you
operating you with controls?

841
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,554
Good one, Jim.

842
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:41,623
Day One, Job One.

843
00:36:43,627 --> 00:36:45,728
<i>Governor Romney
was in Portsmouth today</i>

844
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:47,864
to introduce his economic plan
promising to cut

845
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:50,467
unemployment almost in half
with his 59-point jobs proposal.

846
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:52,102
Touting his experience
in the private sector,

847
00:36:52,136 --> 00:36:54,404
today found the former CEO
campaigning in Portsmouth,

848
00:36:54,438 --> 00:36:57,440
where Governor Romney
unveiled his Day One, Job One plan

849
00:36:57,475 --> 00:37:00,344
<i>that would add 12 million
new jobs in his first term.</i>

850
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:02,579
<i>The 59-point
proposal promises</i>

851
00:37:02,614 --> 00:37:05,817
<i>to cut President Obama's
unemployment rate nearly in half.</i>

852
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,588
You know, Jim,
if you'd open up a little,

853
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:11,323
we could have, like,
a bond or something.

854
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:14,159
Embeds bond on the road.
And there's a lot of sex.

855
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:15,994
- For who?
- Players gotta play.

856
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,429
- With who?
- Whom.

857
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:18,697
Shut the fuck up,
that's with whom.

858
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:21,132
- Jim, are you feeling me?
- I really hope not.

859
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:24,468
- You can't force a bond.
- It happens in every road movie.

860
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:25,836
Bing Crosby and Bob Hope.

861
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:27,171
Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.

862
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,374
- Which one of those guys are you?
- Bing and Dean.

863
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:31,943
- And you can be Dorothy Lamour.
<i>- I didn't pack my sarong.</i>

864
00:37:31,977 --> 00:37:33,678
<i>I'll buy you a sarong
if you'll wear it.</i>

865
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:35,045
<i>I'll sew you a sarong
if you'll wear it.</i>

866
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,847
<i>You're not wearing a sarong.</i>

867
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:38,882
<i>- So just you?</i>
<i>- Nobody's wearing a sarong.</i>

868
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:53,830
You got one.

869
00:37:53,864 --> 00:37:56,599
Your guy can't just e-mail
the translations?

870
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,901
- He doesn't like e-mail.
- Why?

871
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:00,336
I didn't follow up.

872
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,205
Wazir_teacher tweets,

873
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,042
"Uncle just intro me
to #Misbah-ul-Haq!"

874
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:08,111
Find out
who Misbah-ul-Haq is.

875
00:38:08,145 --> 00:38:10,847
Hang on.

876
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:12,883
He's a cricket player.

877
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,652
Keep calling.

878
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:17,587
Get this guy
to translate faster.

879
00:38:17,622 --> 00:38:20,324
Neal, listen,
I need you to give serious

880
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:22,493
and immediate attention
to the website.

881
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:23,961
Are we down?
I would have been alerted.

882
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:26,463
No, it's up and running,
but it's not--

883
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:29,433
The blog isn't accomplishing
what it should.

884
00:38:29,468 --> 00:38:32,437
And even though I can't
tell you specifically what to change,

885
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:34,005
I want a complete overhaul.

886
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:36,541
I see, you're doing
a topical satire of OWS.

887
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:38,477
Well, I'm not willing to say
exactly what I'm doing,

888
00:38:38,511 --> 00:38:40,880
- because I don't want it corrupted by the media.
- It's a good joke.

889
00:38:40,914 --> 00:38:43,716
And while I am the boss,
we don't have "leaders,"

890
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:46,153
- so there's really no one--
- Can I show you something?

891
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:52,425
We experienced a massive failure
of our banking system,

892
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,762
which devastated the lives
of millions of people, right?

893
00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:56,596
Protesters marched
last Saturday

894
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:58,899
and got pepper sprayed
by the police.

895
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:01,401
This is the Fox coverage,
which was about

896
00:39:01,436 --> 00:39:03,837
does pepper spray hurt?

897
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:06,273
Now you see--
Then I guess the pepper spray

898
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:08,241
happens right there
and the women go down.

899
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:10,744
Arthur, I don't know.
I see these women screaming.

900
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:12,713
It's like they've been
shot in the face.

901
00:39:12,747 --> 00:39:14,681
<i>Now, listen, I've never been
pepper sprayed in the face,</i>

902
00:39:14,715 --> 00:39:16,683
but there's got to be
an argument

903
00:39:16,717 --> 00:39:18,685
that they're being
overly dramatic,

904
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,187
<i>that they're playing it up
for the cameras.</i>

905
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:22,122
<i>And that very well
may be the fact.</i>

906
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:23,657
<i>It's just so hard...</i>

907
00:39:23,691 --> 00:39:26,293
- That wasn't a great report.
- It was better than our nothing.

908
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:27,761
Neal, the incoherence,

909
00:39:27,795 --> 00:39:29,896
the hand signals
and the nonsense--

910
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:31,865
These guys don't make it easy.

911
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:35,669
I think--
I really feel that by fixating on--

912
00:39:35,703 --> 00:39:39,072
And one of your Occupy idiots
jumped in front of the cab in front of me

913
00:39:39,106 --> 00:39:41,274
in an Uncle Sam costume
this morning

914
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:42,909
and we slammed
into a honey wagon.

915
00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:45,011
I walked the other
14 blocks in the rain.

916
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:47,381
Do you know what happens
to my shoes in the rain?

917
00:39:47,415 --> 00:39:49,049
- Was anyone hurt?
- Yes.

918
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:52,019
But incredibly not the guy
in the Uncle Sam costume.

919
00:39:52,053 --> 00:39:53,921
- <i>Mac--</i>
- OWS does nothing for me.

920
00:39:53,955 --> 00:39:55,856
Their disdain for leadership
is producing--

921
00:39:55,891 --> 00:39:57,825
surprise-- no leaders.

922
00:39:57,859 --> 00:39:59,894
- If that's their worst crime--
<i>- No, it's not.</i>

923
00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:01,996
Their worst crime is
making the Tea Party look good.

924
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,564
How can you say--

925
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,534
I can say that because
there are 87 members of the Tea Party

926
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:09,871
who write laws now
and OWS has a cardboard library.

927
00:40:09,905 --> 00:40:12,474
<i>You think you need to convince me
this is serious?</i>

928
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:13,975
It is and they're blowing it.

929
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,644
They made themselves the punch line,
not us.

930
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:17,245
- Can't you get past the punch line?
<i>- No.</i>

931
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,548
Well, it probably
helps that--

932
00:40:19,582 --> 00:40:21,317
- What?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

933
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:22,618
Probably helps that what?

934
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:25,921
That the shoes you
walked 14 blocks in cost $1,200.

935
00:40:28,224 --> 00:40:30,859
- Okay, that was spunky.
- I didn't mean to imply--

936
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:34,162
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah, I did. Ahem.

937
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:37,933
Here we go, then.

938
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:40,736
Find me a bright, articulate,

939
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,272
informed representative
of the pajama party

940
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:44,873
and I will give them
five minutes

941
00:40:44,908 --> 00:40:47,176
of national prime time air
with Will McAvoy.

942
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,777
You will?

943
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:50,445
Yes, but you should
warn him or her

944
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,581
that he or she is gonna
get their limbs torn off.

945
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:54,283
This was a big one
and they fucked it up.

946
00:40:54,317 --> 00:40:55,684
Don't get me a tomato can.

947
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:57,486
I want him to beat the shit
out of the best they've got.

948
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,054
But he'll be fair?

949
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:01,490
He's a lot of things, man,
but has he ever been unfair?

950
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:02,891
<i>If I don't get a name soon,</i>

951
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:06,294
I'm just gonna start
randomly firing people!

952
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:07,862
I mean in real life.

953
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:09,297
No.

954
00:41:09,332 --> 00:41:11,266
You're in the batter's box now,
brother.

955
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,001
You brought my shoes into it.

956
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:15,337
Got it.

957
00:41:16,572 --> 00:41:17,973
Thank you.

If I ask nicely,
you think your translator could take longer?

961
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,733
- Excuse me.
- Sorry about this.

962
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,535
Hey, Zane, Sloan.

963
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,770
What's with your chair?

964
00:41:47,804 --> 00:41:49,739
It was squeaky
and now he's fixed it.

965
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,908
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah, I would appreciate it

966
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,343
if you would let me produce my show
and you produce your show.

967
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,646
I don't give Elliot notes behind your back,
in front of your back.

968
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,915
- He didn't give me notes.
- You came to me and said Don Keefer agrees.

969
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,650
- He did agree.
- That's giving you notes.

970
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,619
- This is our discussion.
- Do I need to be here for it?

It's <i>Market Wrap-Up</i>.

972
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,323
Just tell people what happened today,
what to do tomorrow.

973
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:09,091
We are not talking
about drones.

974
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:12,361
If you're gonna speak to me like that,
you really should get me a chew toy.

975
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,330
- I would like an apology.
- I'm sorry.

976
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:15,798
- For what?
- I don't know.

977
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,433
This is not the first time
this has happened.

978
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:19,569
You put shit in her head.

979
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,038
Zane, she's got
50 IQ points on both of us.

980
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,940
There's nothing
I can put in her head.

981
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,142
Now, can I suggest
that we all just--

982
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,979
It's the new tires.

983
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,384
It's my understanding
that Sloan's advice to consumers

984
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,752
was that they'd make money
off the stock.

985
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:36,819
But that they shouldn't buy it.

986
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:38,621
If they have a problem
with drones.

987
00:42:38,655 --> 00:42:40,389
- Which I thought was good information.
- And that's what he said.

988
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,325
- Yes, but not the only thing I said.
- He did say something else.

989
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,560
- And what was that?
- That I have to do what my EP tells me to,

990
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,129
<i>but I thought
that was bad advice.</i>

991
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,697
I thought you were one for two on advice,
which ain't bad.

992
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,699
- Sloan.
- Zane, I'm telling people

993
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,835
where the fucking money comes from
and if you have a problem with that,

994
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,437
you should speak to the president of
the news division, Charlie Skinner.

995
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,573
And if you ever lead me by the wrist
through that newsroom again,

996
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:00,177
I'm gonna take out each of your goddamn
knuckles with a ball peen hammer.

997
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,415
God damn it!

998
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,085
All right.

999
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,358
So I'm gonna go tell Will
it was me.

1000
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,792
Yeah, I know.
You want me to come with you?

1001
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,661
Will isn't as scary
as people--

1002
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:21,197
- Yes, because I think if there's a witness--
- Yeah.

1003
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:24,834
Getting to Mars
isn't the problem.

1004
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,603
We know how to get to Mars.
It's getting back.

1005
00:43:27,637 --> 00:43:29,305
<i>So here's what I'd do.</i>

1006
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,040
Come in.

1007
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:33,742
Charlie's here for this, too.
That's exactly what I was hoping for.

1008
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,511
Here for what?

1009
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:38,348
I'm pretty sure I was the leak.

1010
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,316
Oh, really?

1011
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:41,651
I was supposed to go
to a wedding with a guy

1012
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,119
and I would have been
out on the 11th,

1013
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,988
and when I found out I was going on,
I told him.

1014
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,690
So he knew you were off
before you got the flu.

1015
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,228
And it turns out the guy's
Nina Howard's book agent.

1016
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,465
You told Nina's book agent?

1017
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:55,800
I didn't know
he was her agent at the time.

1018
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:58,403
I knew he was <i>an</i> agent,
but it wasn't until I Googled him--

1019
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:00,271
- Why'd you Google him?
- You know, after drinks.

1020
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:01,673
- You had drinks?
- This part doesn't matter.

1021
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:03,575
- <i>It matters to me a little.</i>
- Why?

1022
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:06,445
- I'm not sure.
- Wait, this is wrong.

1023
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:08,714
I know. What do we think
the appropriate punishment should be?

1024
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:12,051
I think certainly
she should be mocked relentlessly--

1025
00:44:12,085 --> 00:44:16,388
You said Nina asked you
if you took yourself off voluntarily

1026
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:18,291
or if Reese or Leona did it.

1027
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:21,594
<i>And you told her
that I took you off.</i>

1028
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:24,563
And she said she liked
that you told her the truth.

1029
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:28,201
- Yeah?
- How did she know you were telling the truth?

1030
00:44:30,805 --> 00:44:34,140
Did you tell the wedding guy
who took Will off?

1031
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:36,143
No. In fact,
I wouldn't have been able to because--

1032
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:37,944
Because Will told everyone
it was his decision.

1033
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,149
Son de la bitch.

1034
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:45,451
- Are you kidding me?
- Get it out of the safe.

1035
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:47,620
I want him to
hear the branch creak.

1036
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:48,621
What's going on?

1037
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:50,957
Guys, we thank you
for your help.

1038
00:44:50,991 --> 00:44:53,793
But at this point,
we must go alone.

1039
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:55,661
- I wasn't the leak?
- No.

1040
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:58,031
- All right.
- You still couldn't keep your mouth shut.

1041
00:44:58,065 --> 00:45:00,333
- Just open the safe.
- I am.

1042
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,511
- Did you forget the combination?
- No.

1043
00:45:11,546 --> 00:45:13,547
It's right,

1044
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:15,949
<i>then past the original.</i>

1045
00:45:15,984 --> 00:45:17,851
- Oh, God.
- Do you know what's going on?

1046
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:19,953
I do, but I'm not telling you
because you went out for drinks with a book agent.

1047
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:21,688
I had to make up
for canceling on the wedding.

1048
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:23,456
When you get married
and he yells at you for not liking

1049
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:25,491
the new unabridged edition
of <i>Peer Gynt</i>, don't come--

1050
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:26,726
Got it!

1051
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,595
All right.

1052
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:32,999
Will, we ride.

1053
00:45:40,275 --> 00:45:43,177
"Karzai accuses us.
Zardari accuses them.

1054
00:45:43,211 --> 00:45:45,646
We're all Pashtun."

1055
00:45:47,282 --> 00:45:49,183
- Can we see him?
- I'll see if he's avai--

1056
00:45:49,217 --> 00:45:50,785
Good.

1057
00:45:53,021 --> 00:45:55,256
Did you tell Nina Howard
that I didn't have the flu

1058
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,559
and that Charlie took me off
the anniversary coverage?

1059
00:45:57,593 --> 00:45:59,594
- Come on in.
- Did you tell Nina Howard--

1060
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:02,497
- Yes.
- I'm sorry?

1061
00:46:02,531 --> 00:46:05,499
Yes, I did.
Anything else?

1062
00:46:05,534 --> 00:46:07,201
Why?

1063
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:09,303
I didn't like
that you blackmailed me.

1064
00:46:09,338 --> 00:46:11,572
I didn't like that you blackmailed
my mother and this company.

1065
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:14,609
I don't like the condescension
or that I'm an object of derision for you.

1066
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:17,612
I don't like that you average 1.5 a night
when you could be getting two million.

1067
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:19,613
I don't like the trouble
you cause the rest of the company

1068
00:46:19,648 --> 00:46:21,649
<i>when you gleefully
and arrogantly insult anyone</i>

1069
00:46:21,683 --> 00:46:23,784
<i>who doesn't conform
to your certainty.</i>

1070
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:26,620
I don't like-- Was that enough?
You need more?

1071
00:46:26,654 --> 00:46:28,489
- You did it just to do it?
<i>- Yep.</i>

1072
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:30,324
<i>You didn't care
how it made the company look?</i>

1073
00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:33,194
We look great.
We look like we're sensitive to the situation.

1074
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:35,830
Or we were gonna anyway.
Somehow you got her to kill the piece,

1075
00:46:35,864 --> 00:46:37,331
so I'll have to leak it
to someone else.

1076
00:46:37,366 --> 00:46:38,499
- No.
- Yeah.

1077
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:40,101
'Cause we did blackmail you.

1078
00:46:40,135 --> 00:46:42,603
It wasn't bluster
when I said I don't care.

1079
00:46:42,637 --> 00:46:45,072
- I don't care.
- Your mother cares.

1080
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:46,940
Mrs. Lansing is more
than happy to let me handle

1081
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:49,409
extremely low-level problems,
like the tape

1082
00:46:49,444 --> 00:46:51,411
which we all know you're
never gonna play for anyone.

1083
00:46:51,446 --> 00:46:54,114
I've met you halfway.
I've cared about numbers.

1084
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:55,982
I cared about SOPA
when you asked me to.

1085
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,518
- But we had an arrangement.
- You had an arrangement.

1086
00:46:58,552 --> 00:47:02,689
Maybe you need to be
reminded what's on here.

1087
00:47:08,696 --> 00:47:10,363
Hang on.

1088
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,099
- Did you press...
- Yeah.

1089
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:16,102
I think I-- Wait.

1090
00:47:16,136 --> 00:47:18,704
Fast-forward.

1091
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:23,843
- What the hell, Will?
- What? Me? It was on record.

1092
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:26,445
- Didn't you listen to it?
- Did I what?

1093
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,048
Did you listen to it?

1094
00:47:29,082 --> 00:47:31,017
I just put it in the safe.
The chain of evidence.

1095
00:47:31,051 --> 00:47:32,885
I didn't want--
Well, I don't know what I didn't want--

1096
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,421
- You're such a dumb ass!
- Can I see that a sec?

1097
00:47:36,623 --> 00:47:38,724
Maybe the volume--

1098
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:41,328
<i>I'm the president of AWM.</i>

1099
00:47:41,362 --> 00:47:43,696
You don't meet me halfway.

1100
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:46,265
You meet me the whole way.

1101
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,034
Go do your show.

1102
00:47:54,241 --> 00:47:55,942
Some news, everybody.

1103
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:59,479
Huntsman's fired his New Hampshire
campaign manager, Ethan Eilon,

1104
00:47:59,514 --> 00:48:01,014
which is not surprising,

1105
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:03,717
<i>and replaced him with
Sarah Crawford Stewart,</i>

1106
00:48:03,751 --> 00:48:05,719
<i>who most recently worked
on the Pawlenty campaign,</i>

1107
00:48:05,753 --> 00:48:08,655
which was, of course,
a huge success.

1108
00:48:08,689 --> 00:48:10,791
So those of you
who feel Huntsman

1109
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:12,993
hasn't been getting
enough coverage--

1110
00:48:13,027 --> 00:48:15,795
Shit, Jim, did you have
any friends in school at all?

1111
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,730
What's the governor's plan
with regard to Iran?

1112
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:20,833
The governor said repeatedly that
he won't allow a nuclear Iran.

1113
00:48:20,868 --> 00:48:23,902
- <i>But what's his plan?</i>
- We talked about jobs today.

1114
00:48:23,937 --> 00:48:26,338
How's he gonna restart
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations?

1115
00:48:26,372 --> 00:48:28,974
- By getting elected president.
- Yesterday he said four times

1116
00:48:29,008 --> 00:48:32,510
that health insurance premiums have gone up
$2,500 due to Obamacare.

1117
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:36,214
<i>They've gone up $1,500
and it's due to higher health care costs.</i>

1118
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:37,750
- <i>Any comment?</i>
- No.

1119
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:40,219
The jobless recovery chart
buried in Day One, Job One,

1120
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:43,356
pick-a-bale-of-cotton,
seems to imply that the Obama recovery

1121
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,559
<i>took place in 2007
when Obama wasn't president.</i>

1122
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:48,661
- Any comment?
- Somebody want to get Jim a Valium?

1123
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:50,463
How's the governor
plan to work with

1124
00:48:50,498 --> 00:48:53,067
what will probably be a new
Islamist government in Egypt?

1125
00:48:53,101 --> 00:48:55,702
We talked about jobs today.

1126
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:57,371
I'd like a half hour
face-to-face with the candidate.

1127
00:48:57,405 --> 00:48:58,672
Me, too.

1128
00:48:58,707 --> 00:49:00,541
A half hour.

1129
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:02,777
Sit down, Jim.

1130
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:04,578
Does anybody want to join me?

1131
00:49:04,613 --> 00:49:07,114
Are you really okay
not doing any reporting?

1132
00:49:07,149 --> 00:49:10,116
Sit down.

1133
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:11,851
I don't get it.

1134
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:14,221
Why not just point the camera

1135
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:17,124
<i>at the talking points e-mail
and play music in the background?</i>

1136
00:49:17,158 --> 00:49:18,792
<i>- Jim.</i>
- Hallie, ask the question.

1137
00:49:18,826 --> 00:49:20,460
- Sit down, Jim.
<i>- Ask.</i>

1138
00:49:21,396 --> 00:49:22,830
If you don't, I'm gonna

1139
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:24,532
and you're gonna know
you're a lame fraud.

1140
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:28,303
<i>- She's a professional.</i>
- Sit, now.

1141
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:41,782
All right.

1142
00:49:41,816 --> 00:49:45,251
April 9, 2002,
Mitt Romney completes a questionnaire

1143
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:47,653
provided by the National Abortion
Rights Action League.

1144
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:49,355
Everything is in
your talking points memo.

1145
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:51,424
Yeah, no, it's not,
'cause in this questionnaire

1146
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,659
he said,
"I respect and will protect

1147
00:49:53,693 --> 00:49:54,893
a woman's right to choose.

1148
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:56,829
<i>This choice is
a deeply personal one."</i>

1149
00:49:56,863 --> 00:49:58,297
We're not talking
about that today.

1150
00:49:58,331 --> 00:49:59,965
I'm talking about it today.

1151
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,636
<i>June, this past June,
102 days ago,</i>

1152
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:06,840
your candidate said,
"I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade."

1153
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:08,241
Don't let Jim egg you on.

1154
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,710
Don't change the fucking subject.
Which is it?

1155
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:13,012
- Let's everybody calm down.
- We know the questions.

1156
00:50:13,047 --> 00:50:15,048
Why aren't we
insisting on answers?

1157
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:16,750
Because they want
to stay on the bus.

1158
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:19,853
Why?
It's not a press bus.

1159
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:21,722
It's a free media bus.

1160
00:50:21,756 --> 00:50:25,092
We can get off this bus,
rent cars,

1161
00:50:25,126 --> 00:50:27,995
and cover the campaign
the way a campaign should be covered.

1162
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:31,098
<i>Like a cross-examination
in a courtroom.</i>

1163
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:33,667
We can force them
to answer our questions

1164
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:37,671
if we do it together,
if nobody backs down.

1165
00:50:37,706 --> 00:50:39,673
They need us.

1166
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:42,310
Who's with me?

1167
00:50:42,344 --> 00:50:44,212
I am.

1168
00:50:46,482 --> 00:50:48,517
Okay, who else?

1169
00:50:55,925 --> 00:50:58,093
Oh, God.

1170
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,647
Do you have a plan?

1171
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,452
I'm formulating one.

1172
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:22,620
Right.

1173
00:51:22,655 --> 00:51:25,089
Well, you know, take your time.

1174
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,226
I lifted some
turkey sandwiches.

1175
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,428
Nice.

1176
00:51:36,401 --> 00:51:38,936
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

1177
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:43,707
I didn't even know
you were still here.

1178
00:51:43,742 --> 00:51:46,043
We're both working late.

1179
00:51:46,077 --> 00:51:48,646
Public Affairs at AFRICOM
called before the show.

1180
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,383
They feel this is a sensitive time
because of the recent troop deployment,

1181
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:54,351
- and they want to pull your clearance, but--
- God.

1182
00:51:54,386 --> 00:51:57,020
- No, listen, Maggie.
- Jesus. Let me blow off some steam,

1183
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,090
'cause I didn't say anything
when I got YouTubed

1184
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,726
and Don kicked me out
or Jim started treating me like a sister

1185
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:04,862
and Lisa stopped speaking to me
because I had this thing.

1186
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:06,864
I had Africa.
I had my first story.

1187
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:09,799
And I've taken these pills
of which one of the side effects

1188
00:52:09,834 --> 00:52:11,534
should be extreme paranoia
about the side effects.

1189
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:13,971
Listen to me.
They want to pull your clearance, <i>but</i>--

1190
00:52:14,873 --> 00:52:17,541
Oh. Go on.

1191
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:20,879
I got them to agree to it
if you tack on a human interest story.

1192
00:52:20,913 --> 00:52:23,181
The troops do a lot
of community outreach.

1193
00:52:23,216 --> 00:52:26,652
So you and Gary are going to
an orphanage in north Uganda

1194
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:28,854
that shelters kids
whose parents have been killed in the wars.

1195
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:32,659
The troops will pass out textbooks
and soccer balls and you'll get some film.

1196
00:52:32,693 --> 00:52:35,428
- That's great.
- Yeah.

1197
00:52:37,297 --> 00:52:39,164
- I'm going.
- You're going.

1198
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:41,100
I'm not gonna make
a fool out of you.

1199
00:52:41,134 --> 00:52:42,902
I know.

1200
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:47,306
Take this.

1201
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,410
$100?

1202
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:53,879
You'd be amazed at the trouble
you can get out of with that.

1203
00:52:53,913 --> 00:52:56,281
Okay, but I'll be
drawing cash from--

1204
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:57,849
No, it's a tradition.

1205
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,884
You either come back
with the $100 bill

1206
00:52:59,918 --> 00:53:01,786
or you come back with
the story of where it went.

1207
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:05,756
Good luck.

1208
00:53:07,825 --> 00:53:10,928
That was pretty nice of Nina Howard
to kill the piece.

1209
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:13,530
She is nice.
I met her last month.

1210
00:53:13,564 --> 00:53:16,199
She said she regretted
a lot of things she'd done.

1211
00:53:16,233 --> 00:53:18,301
I should call and thank her.

1212
00:53:33,785 --> 00:53:35,452
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi.

1213
00:53:35,487 --> 00:53:37,788
This is your old friend
MacKenzie McHale.

1214
00:53:37,823 --> 00:53:39,290
I hope I'm not
calling too late.

1215
00:53:39,324 --> 00:53:41,359
No, no, not at all.

1216
00:53:41,393 --> 00:53:43,595
It's-- It's great
to hear from you.

1217
00:53:43,629 --> 00:53:45,363
<i>I just wanted to say thanks
for killing the piece.</i>

1218
00:53:45,398 --> 00:53:47,133
- I owe you one.
<i>- I hacked your phone.</i>

1219
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:48,935
<i>I think I owe you
more than one.</i>

1220
00:53:48,969 --> 00:53:52,272
- All right, have a good night.
- You, too.

1221
00:53:52,306 --> 00:53:53,940
- <i>Listen.</i>
- Yeah?

1222
00:53:53,975 --> 00:53:57,310
- Nothing.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1223
00:53:57,345 --> 00:53:59,146
Can I cash in?

1224
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,914
I didn't hear that.

1225
00:54:00,948 --> 00:54:03,383
On the more than one.

1226
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:07,186
<i>MacKenzie?</i>

1227
00:54:10,558 --> 00:54:14,160
Do you happen to remember
the rest of Will's message

1228
00:54:14,194 --> 00:54:18,063
after he said,
"I'm not just saying this because I'm high"?

1229
00:54:18,098 --> 00:54:19,765
<i>I was just curious.</i>

1230
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:22,167
Yeah, no, he said

1231
00:54:22,202 --> 00:54:25,336
he thought you did
an amazing job with the coverage.

1232
00:54:25,371 --> 00:54:27,305
<i>With the bin Laden coverage.</i>

1233
00:54:27,339 --> 00:54:30,775
He-- I mean,
I don't remember it word for word,

1234
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:34,778
but it was about
how you did a great job.

1235
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,948
<i>That's really nice.
It was a team effort.</i>

1236
00:54:38,016 --> 00:54:39,850
I'll bet.

1237
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:42,519
All right.
Anyway, thanks again.

1238
00:54:42,553 --> 00:54:44,554
<i>Have a good night.</i>

1239
00:55:00,605 --> 00:55:02,506
MacKenzie just called me.

1240
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,109
- Why?
- To thank me for killing the piece.

1241
00:55:06,143 --> 00:55:08,845
Oh.

1242
00:55:10,914 --> 00:55:13,182
You don't have to look like
you did something wrong.

1243
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,091
Jerry's guys are still here
working the phones.

1244
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:25,094
- They stay late every night.
- I think it's time.

1245
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:27,330
Me, too.

1246
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:35,472
Is this the Menendez
that served with MARSOC in 2009?

1247
00:55:35,506 --> 00:55:37,307
I'm sorry for calling so late.

1248
00:55:37,341 --> 00:55:40,276
- Jerry.
- I know.

1249
00:55:40,311 --> 00:55:43,012
I've got to pull the plug.

1250
00:55:43,046 --> 00:55:45,014
It's a true story, Mac.

1251
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:51,287
All right, everybody,
thanks anyway.

1252
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:56,192
Happy to be done with this guy.

1253
00:56:01,765 --> 00:56:03,665
What's--

1254
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,235
It's written phonetically.
What's Willie Pete?

1255
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:08,738
- Hmm?
- What's Willie Pete?

1256
00:56:10,173 --> 00:56:11,774
It's white phosphorus.

1257
00:56:13,343 --> 00:56:16,211
Hamni8. "Willie Pete everywhere.
Burning."

1258
00:56:21,483 --> 00:56:24,785
Hamni8.
"Helicopters, grenades."

1259
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:31,391
Hamni8.
"Men in gas masks. Machine guns."

1260
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:37,598
Hamni8. "Burning."

1261
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:43,070
Hamni8. "Americans.
White smoke."

1262
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,276
Hamni8. "Two helicopters.
No markings on them, but they're American."

1263
00:56:51,646 --> 00:56:52,947
This is from the translator.

1264
00:56:52,981 --> 00:56:55,216
"I'm translating
the next Hamni8 tweet.

1265
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,452
It was sent 32 minutes
after the last."

1266
00:56:57,486 --> 00:56:59,521
Why'd he stop for 32 minutes?

1267
00:56:59,555 --> 00:57:01,590
- Jamming.
- What?

1268
00:57:01,624 --> 00:57:03,091
Digital frequency hopping.

1269
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:05,761
We'd have jammed the radio frequencies
cell phones use.

1270
00:57:08,932 --> 00:57:11,267
He's describing Genoa.
